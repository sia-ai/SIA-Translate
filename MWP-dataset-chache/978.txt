God said

so God made Adam fall asleep
he took one of Adam's ribs and made a woman from it
Adam named his wife Eve
Eve
it's like Mommy's name
Adam and Eve disobey God
genesis three
the snake was more sneaky than any of the other animals
he said to Eve did God really say that you must not eat from any tree in the garden
Eve said we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden
but we must not eat fruit from the middle tree in the middle of the garden
we must not touch it or we will die
you will not you will not die the snake said
God knows that when you eat the fruit your eyes will be open
you will be like God
Eve took some fruit and ate it
she also gave some to Adam
he ate it
then they realized they were they were naked
so they sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves and they hid from God
in the cool of the day God called Adam
where are you
where are you
Adam answered I heard you and I was afraid because I was naked so I hid
God said who told you that you were naked
have you eaten from the tree that I told you not to eat from
uhoh
Adam said
yeah that's right
uhoh
they're in big trouble
big trouble
Adam said Eve gave me some fruit and I ate it
yeah
then God said to Eve what have you done
Eve said the serpent tricked me and I ate
so God sent Adam and Eve away from the garden of Eden
