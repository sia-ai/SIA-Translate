you wanna put two sides on there
where are you gonna put that one
you don't need this stuff
that goes right here um hum
how hang it up well it's got this little hole thing and then you hook it on these little hooks
but you know what there's only a certain number of hooks these are extras
yeah but there's nothing to hang them on honey
because there are not enough they only give us a certain number of hooks
so what should we do with these what could we do with these long things here
put them in the books that's not a bad idea and then we'll know what page to read
right we'll use them as bookmarks that's a good idea
you're gonna use them as bookmarks I have another good idea too something we could do with them
