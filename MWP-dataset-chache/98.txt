alright
oh
don't do that Joanna
it's really rude
if you need to do that eat someplace else
no
I just
continue to talk but maybe we're all talking
we were having a nice conversation mm
mm
and you know what
when we tape+record it and then Laura hears her snivelling on the tape+recorder maybe she it will stop her habit
do you think that would stop your habit to hear how terrible it sounds
you hear it when
well
then why do you go on snivelling
because she doesn't like the noise
no
I'm asking Laura
why do you go on snivelling
what
noone plays with you
I play with you
that's different than snivelling isn't it
Laura eat the apple+sauce in your bowl please
you have to eat this
crying when you get hurt is different from whining isn't it
mhm
it's the whining part of crying that I object to
I was crying in the middle of the night last night and noone heard me
were you
maybe I didn't
when were you crying
I don't know
what were you crying about
I didn't hear anybody crying xxx
I had a bad dream and I was half awake and half not
well
if it's really bad you could always come and tell us you know
mm
I didn't know I was crying
then I knew it I didn't
I knew xxx
that was
and what about your xxx
I know what it was about
it was about Peanuts got killed
not died by poisoning but got killed
I see
and made me sad
that does make you sad to think about Peanuts
so I cried in the middle of the night and I didn't know why I was crying but I did know why I was crying
mm
look
well
you can always come and get us if you need us for something important
I don't want you to come and get me just for the heck of it
in the middle of the night
Laura

and he sneezed with the food in his mouth right on her
uhuh
did you apple+sauce you both liked
that you didn't spit out
but practically everything else I made you you'd spit it right out at me
anything else
but you like carrots and apple+sauce but you didn't like liver
I went to all the trouble of making this liver for you
you would take one mouthful of it and then you would take your tongue and spray it all over the place
you'd go
then it sprayed everywhere
