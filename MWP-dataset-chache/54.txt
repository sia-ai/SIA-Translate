when we ever went out in Denver it was warm right
there was always snow
oh yeah

I don't know Mark took them all off

we don't need you to rattle our cages anymore
ya wanna see something
went to a fur sale
hm
I saw jackets
mhm
um curly lamb jackets there were white blue fox ones for one hundred fifty eight
hm
blue fox and raccoon pieced ones two fifty eight
mhm
um designer fox jackets and possum they were neat looking
mhm
two eighty five
mhm
here you can look at these
oh
go away Mark
and then there were coats for a lot
mhm
a thousand you know and some but the jackets were fairly cheap
what do you need this for
well you know how I wanted to have my jacket my coat done
mhm
I went in there to see what they were doing with theirs of course theirs were just lovely and all brand new fur
yeah
and they were all long fur they didn't have any Karakul like mine
uhuh is curly lamb what you've got
no Karakul
curly lamb looks different
oh
curly lamb's long
curly lamb was lon white too
mhm I though you weren't going to get any more fur coats
um that was your concept not mine
I thought when we went to Holland we bought those coats
well I have that those nice coats
I don't really need a coat its just that I remember I was thinking of taking the coat I have
mhm
and having it reworked
I thought we all we decided about all this that we said instead of reworking it we'd just get a nice comfortable regular coat
and that we'd end up buying two of them and that would suffice
two really nice coats
well
it would kind of do the trick
when I dragged out that one I thought you know this would be great
now I saw these prices now these aren't typical prices this is a big deal
mhm
sale um
Ross do you want some Fritos
go ahead
xxx the warm weather causes a huge coat overstock
yep
yeah xxx
here ya go Marky
um this was at the xxx
yeah
but I looked at these prices and I thought well if I took my coat in
mhm
and the price started going up too heavily
yeah
um
you'd better just get a new one right
I think well I I think that
I you oughta learn more about fur
I felt that these are not for you
the fur I got
that's enough
you eat those and then I'll try and find some more
the fur I got was a dreadful cheap one
the fur was cheap right
and it didn't last very long
mhm
I really don't think you should repair it
the collar's good
hm yeah
um while I felt my idea for repair was good
but it had a a_lot_of sense to it you know
but the price might get beyond um this in which case its stupid
I guess we have_to decide what price
what grade what kind of fur are you really going for
would make it worth it
you know I love fur xxx
you know also that a_lot_of people don't think its right to wear fur jackets okay
its xxx see it as worse than smoking
you know your attitude toward smoking in public
I think a_lot_of people would say the same thing about having a fur jacket
who would
you would
I think I do too
yeah I think I'd feel the same way
you sure have xxx to get wid of all of my widdle furs
it seems barbaric to me
is that xxx unnecessary xxx
okay now we want cookies
where ya gonna get cookies
what
where ya gonna get cookies
there's a big box
oh the sack
you know what I'm going to do with those tomorrow with the boys

to the birds because you don't like to eat them

you know how they're in the shape of hearts and stuff
we could tie them on the bushes for them the birds
wouldn't that be cute
we were gonna do it today but I didn't get the time
very good
and you know what
each one was kissed by a sun
yeah one was kissed by Mark the other was kissed by Ross
hm
do know why they say Sunkist
they mean the fruit has been kissed by the sun from the sky

I haven't seen leathers xxx
you know that xxx

xxx put the top on xxx
that's good
I saw a muskrat oh
was that beautiful I'll bet you muskrat

oh
I dunno
a fairly late occurring verb error in Ross
he said
and he should have said
I've eaten that before
because he wanted to use the progressive to get for the current relevance
yeah I know it shows the current relevance of your earlier demonstration right
of your earlier act
right
whereas you would say I ate that before I went to the store
but you would say
I've eaten it before

they're digging up the metal
oh you mean the ones that blow up are where are the ones that blow up
right xxx
yep
xxx they're underground
in the mine field
yeah but
but are they real deep underground

some mines could be in space right
what about in water
could you have mine+water
could you mine a harbor
mhm

you mean in the mine storms
oh what's the thing that comes last in the mine stories
no it's the mine xxx
no the mine layer
what do you mean

no Marky means the mine layer
mine sweeper mine layer it's the one that drops the mines
uhuh
it starts in the beginning of the when you start the beginning of the game it goes bUm bUm bUm bUm bUm bUm bUm bUm and it drops them all around in space right
I mean you have_to clear them out
mhm
do ya think ya get
can you think of any other mines
what if your teacher says
you better
mind now is that like does that sound the same as the one where you dig
I'm going if you're a miner
have you ever heard that a person's a miner
they dig in a mine
there's a difference between a minder and a miner
see one of
one has a d on the end
which one of them has a d on the end
what is that honey
what does that mean
your mind and so it's not the same as when you are digging
it doesn't sound the same either well when you're paying attention
but if you talk Pittsburgh_style then it does sound the same right
it's my mind
you are accusing Ross of always blaming you even when you don't make the trouble
is that true
is that why
mhm
how many years did he do it
mhm you said you saw him blame you a_lot_of years even when you weren't the person that did it
two years
four or five years he blamed you
mhm and what else does your horrible brother do
that's all
okay just a minute I have_to get the phone
you're gonna tell me the story of You're_not_elected_Charlie_Brown
go ahead shoot
this is a book report
you sit on the chair and I'll stand over there and I'll pretend you pretend you're talking to the class
and tell them the whole story of You're_not_elected_Charlie_Brown
this is a story by
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
hm
you sold out huh
and that's the end of the story
mhm okay now who did who did Lucy want to win
Linus okay
uhuh but how about the other kids
did they want Charlie to win
Russell
uhuh
I see okay
okay let's see so did let's see if there's anything else in this story Russell Anderson what happened to Russell Anderson
he lost
but how many candidates were there how many people
and so how many
no one voted for what
mhm
I see
now what did do you what is it that made
what is it that made Linus lose
who won
but how come
Linus won
but what did Linus say that was stupid
uhuh
right okay but you know something
did you how many votes did did Russell get
eighty three
and how many did Linus get
eighty four just one extra one
okay
so it was a tie right
that was called a tie
unless okay
mhm okay
so what is Linus can Linus fix the lockers
he couldn't do them right
what did he think he was going to do
right and so he can't do it
now what about all the parts in the beginning when they have trouble with their stupid lockers
that's not so interesting yeah
I think you're right so you want to tell the whole story again one more time
yeah let's tell it one more time so daddy will listen to it
cause you have_to do a real good job when you're up there in front of the class
well I think what's the most funny part of the story
I think it's when Linus talks about the great pumpkin
I think its when Linus talks and also what does Lucy do to get people to vote for Linus
what did she do
you ought_to tell them about that okay
okay tell them about that so what are you going to say
how did Lucy get people to vote for for her brother
and what did she do with the other kids
yanked him by his collar
yeah
yeah
yeah and one day Linus had been good to him yeah
and what of the other kids what'd she do to them
xxx chech third kid
yeah but Russell Anderson said
I'm running against him
so he wasn't voting but he ended up voting for him anyway
okay so that's the funny part is when and the other funny part is when Linus says instead of giving a speech he's gonna tell them about the great pumpkin
and that made him lose a_lot_of votes don't you think
because xxx
thought it was funny
yeah he's a pretty good comedian
and because what did Lucy say
that's the worst speech I ever heard now I know we're going to win
right okay
