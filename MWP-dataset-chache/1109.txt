or the special delivery with the box marked
what does it say on the box
you were saying it yesterday
what did the box say
urgent
urgent means important that's right
Cranky was unloading a box for Sir Topham Hatt
the box was marked urgent
humph creaked Cranky what's so urgent about this package
Thomas heard Cranky's question
if it says urgent we should get it to Sir Topham Hatt as fast as we can he said
I'll take it
just then Gordon pulled up next to Thomas
an urgent package needs a speedy train said Gordon I'm
yup he doesn't have it any more
where is it
it must be on the docks here
I'm the fastest train here so I will have_to take the package
Gordon took the package and set off immediately
Thomas was left behind
I could have gotten it there quickly he peeped
Gordon hurried down the track and took a hilly shortcut
suddenly he saw a red signal
some rocks had fallen across his path
he was stuck
just then Toby came by on an open truck
help said Gordon
I have an urgent package for Sir Topham Hatt
I'll take it down the hill said Toby
thank you
Gordon called as Toby chugged away
Toby clickety_clacked quickly down the hill
what's that
what's that Ethan
a waterfall like we saw yesterday yeah
Percy was waiting at the bottom
thank you for bringing the urgent package down said Percy
now I can take it to Sir Topham Hatt
Sir Topham Hatt will be very proud of me Percy tooted as he hurried along
toot toot no he doesn't say toot he says peep
Percy rounded a bend and saw James ahead of him pulling two troublesome trucks
yep they're in the way
James was going very slowly because the trucks had their brakes on
they were trying to stop James
we want to take the package said the troublesome trucks
we won't release our brakes until you give it to us
they wouldn't go until they took the package
Percy was very mad
but he knew that the urgent package had to get to Sir Topham Hatt quickly
with a sigh xxx he gave it to the trucks
no more trouble from you trucks said James
the trucks released their brakes
James and the trucks quickly left Percy behind
was Thomas listening to the story too
James was glad he would be the one to deliver this urgent package now
James was going so fast he almost didn't see
what is it Ethan
the broken track right
the broken track
oh no wailed James
now Sir Topham Hatt will never get his urgent package
I'll take the urgent package said Harold landing next to James
he took the package and flew off
Harold soared over the countryside
he looked down and saw Thomas pulling in into Tidmouth station
Thomas had been faster than Gordon after all
where's my package Sir Topham Hatt said
just then Harold landed
I have it sir he said
and he told Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt what happened
finally Sir Topham Hatt opened the urgent package
what could be inside
a new hat right
it's a shiny new hat
just in time for tonight's big party Sir Topham Hatt said putting the hat on his head
and Thomas next time there is an urgent package
I want you to bring it
which one
Thomas the tank engine rolling along
that one
he is the one he is the one
one more song there is another one
what is it
Thomas we love you
yep
we know a couple train songs
I'm a little choo+choo train chugging down the track
now I'm going forward now I'm going back
and then we know engine engine number nine
going down
that's Douglas that's right
or Donald
Donald is nine I think and Douglas is ten
engine engine number nine going down Chicago line
if the train should
jump the track
do you want your money back
will you get your money back
yes no a maybe so
yes no a maybe so
that's just a design
it's a design and what's that Ethan
mhm a one
and what's this design
tracks right
when engineers get hot they use this to wipe their face
that's why they carry a kerchief
it's called a kerchief
it's like a handkerchief
remember we read about a handkerchief
xxx I don't know
it's a xxx xxx I don't know
I don't know what it's called it's called a kerchief
that's right
and engineers keep it in their pockets
so they can wipe their faces when it gets hot
or wipe their
they get dusty
because sometimes you get dusty when you drive a train
your pants are falling down huh
and what does he have now
he has the name of the book
looks like Cranky's holding up the name of the book and the name of the book is the special delivery
that's cute
he's holding up the name of the book
that's the urgent package
and who's that
Bulstrode
the barge that's right

I mean Ethan
I mean Max
I mean Ethan

shall we read this one too
Toby and the flood
it had been raining hard for weeks
Toby was feeling miserable
everywhere was
wet
wet
wet
that's a dam
and the water's coming through
it's like a big wall and the water is pouring through
only the great wall known as a dam was stopping the water from overflowing
Percy arrived just as Toby was about to expect the dam for any damage
driver tells me it may be dangerous up there careful Toby
I'll try said Toby bravely
Percy watched anxiously as Toby trundled away
there he goes over that bridge
his journey took him over a wooden bridge at the edge of the village
the river surged dangerously beneath it
the water's getting higher and higher
the river's getting higher and higher
just like in the
just like in that other story
the um what story
about the tugboat
Scuffy
Harold the Helicopter was inspecting the dam as Toby arrived
be brave Toby called his driver
we have_to cross to the other side
the dam did not look safe at all and Toby was worried
soon he knew why
it broke
see the wall broke
the dam's breaking up
we must warn everyone
Toby shunted back as fast as his wheels would let him
Percy was waiting anxiously for Toby by the bridge
the river had risen so high that the bridge was in danger of collapsing
the dam's breaking up we must find high ground
shouted Toby's driver
your only chance is to cross the bridge called Toby
called Percy
it doesn't look safe to me wailed Toby
yeah
Thomas look at it break up like that and the water's rushing through
it's our only chance said his driver
if the dam breaks we'll be
we'll be
done for yep
Toby was halfway across when disaster struck
help called Toby
we'll follow him on our line
it meets the river further down
as Toby floated helplessly in the flood waters they passed a sign that made them shudder
what does it say
beware the waterfall that's right
if we go over that waterfall we're
doomed xxx
then they saw Harold who slooped xxx
swooped
you wanna lie down
okay
you're a tired little pumpkin today huh
let's see
we're gonna drop a rope to you
attach it to yourself
quickly now
and they did
to one of Toby's buffers
just then Percy arrived
Harold flew over to him
catch the rope and pull Toby to safety
he called
Toby was safe at last
see
Percy's pulling Toby
and he's attached to a rope
oof
when the floods were over and the dam mended the villagers had a big party for Toby hosted by Sir Topham Hatt
you were very brave Toby
thanks to Harold
I never could've been so brave Toby said Percy
oh I'm sure you would be
but you never know until you've tried
Percy rather hoped he would never have_to
what story's this
a better view for Gordon that's right
Gordon was feeling grumpy
this was making James cross
why are you complaining all the time
because I'm a big engine and I know everything
I shall complain whenever I want
you're just a small engine with ideas above your station
I can't see any said Percy where are they
any what
ideas above the station
the sky's empty
like your smoke+box Percy
laughed James
but Gordon was still grumpy
one day I'll show you just what a big engine can really do
not speak to silly little green
so what can a big engine really do
not speak to silly little green engines for a start replied Gordon
then he puffed away
later that day Sir Topham Hatt came to see him
Gordon you'll be making one stop today with an empty express to test our new station
you can make up time afterwards
why can't Henry do it
he likes idling in stations
you will do as you are told
so Gordon did but he was still unhappy
and he grew sick too
Gordon was sick
mm can you see his face
there it is
he's making a funny face
mm
I can't do it xxx
do I look like Gordon
xxx you look funny too
I just can't get up to speed he moaned
it's time for your visit to the works
he moaned and he groaned
your pipes are clogged said the fireman
at last they approached the new station
Gordon was impressed but his mood soon changed
in front of him was a blank wall and huge buffers
what a boring view
important engines like me should have a panoramic view where I can see people and people can see me
and he weeshed angrily xxx
weesh
weesh
Gordon was happy when it was time to leave
now you can really enjoy your run as long as your pipes will let you said his driver
come on come on I can go faster than this puffed Gordon
sick
me
never
but Gordon began to feel more and more feeble
that means weak
soon he came to a complete stop
what happened
his driver and his fireman inspected him
something's broken inside you said the fireman
now you really will have_to go to the works
Gordon was still angry when James arrived to collect his cookies
well well well
so much for knowing about everything
you got too puffed up in your boiler so it serves you right
serves you right serves you right
when Gordon returned from the works a few days later he was still boasting
I am the finest engine on the island of Sodor
probably the finest in the world
come on Gordon we're going to the new official opening of the station
then there was trouble
as Gordon approached the station
neither the fire
driver or the fireman could apply his brakes
something had jammed
the driver reduced steam but Gordon was still going too fast
help me please
he pleaded to him
well Gordon said Sir Topham Hatt I knew you wanted a panoramic view but this is not the way to achieve it
what did Gordon say
yes so sorry sir
yes so sorry sir
when Gordon was repaired again he took Sir Topham Hatt to the new station for its second official opening
this time he arrived safely and everyone clapped and cheered as he pulled in
hm
