is daddy there
but she uses the real phone she'll talk to him on the phone regular phone so
bau bai bai
byebye
can ya put it back
a
she calls the dog puppy
do you have a dog at home
no
my sister my sister lives in the same house with us
daudi aum
daddy home
no he went to work
does she use doggie and puppy interchangeably
helo taum
yeah and puppy+dogs no difference same word
I was noticing in fact thinking about this yesterday quite a few words she says like that kitty cat is a kitty cat but we looked at fish yesterday in a tank uh she the big fish were big fish and the small fish were baby fish
so she seems to make a distinction on the size
um but not with dogs
she thought the dragon was a birdie
yeah
originally
except that we have a book that has a dragon in it
so she knows a dragon
you know that's why I was a little surprised frankly
I frankly was surprised that she didn't know that that was a dragon but it's not um it's not really representtative you know it's not long um which the dragon we know in the book is
she has a_lot_of out and in and up and down sort of words
this is a nice toy I've never seen this one before
she hasn't been to a zoo yet so she doesn't understand what those things are
she's tried puppets at home she's a little afraid of it though
but um she knows she knows what puppets we have lots_of puppets
she's also watching the muppets on television my husband for some reason tells them that they're puppets um so I thought she would know what puppet was um because she uses puppets she'll put them on her hand
she seems to know the difference between toy and not toy
I hope
yeah I hope she does
because stereos and televisions oh aren't toys
so she doesn't play with them although she does play with them it obviously doesn't work but I think it's important that she know that some things aren't for her to fool with
this is Nan's this is Nan's it's not Annie's and it's not a toy
Nan's
right
she thought that the cow was a puppy
yeah a_lot_of things are horses words animals that she's not familiar with mules zebras sheep are horses um dogs are kind of a general one for anything else that's left
has she ever seen a cow
no but we have a yeah she's seen lots_of pictures of cows and we have a stuffed cow but she never has really got never has really um understood cows or sheep
let's get down alright
let's get down
you didn't even see this bunny
what's that
mousie it's not a mousie it's a bunny
I'm reminded of a handicapped C_P girl that I worked with for summers and they tested her down at Canton school with a word association test
and um she said the words that were appropriate to her environment which were inappropriate to the answers of the test
and uh I think that's what happens with a kid
that's why the mother can can uh interpret what she's saying because they know from whence it comes
my husband hates cats and every time he sees one he goes
rat
it's obviously working but I think it's getting her a bit confused
are there toys that seem to make her talk more
obviously the books make her talk less
do you use books for that activity
yeah yeah we have lots_of books she doesn't use books at this time of day usually
it's usually at a quieter ti you know when I'm trying to get her to quiet down before resting and stuff we'll sit and look at a book
but it's hard for someone her age to sit anyway
she doesn't under stand that concept
does she really understand the concept of counting
um to three at least um she only skips five so number five So I'm consistently skips number five
did she learn to count herself or is it something you
she started the routine because I haven't been doing any of that and we were really surprised so of course we started counting with her
I think she really start counting because in the gym we um she takes a gym class and she goes one two three jump
they all do that
is it the gym class that's taught her words like turn around and
on my knees
I don't think so
I don't think so
they just have that one routine
where does she get words like on my lap and turn around an
the other side
well on my lap I guess because we have a baby next store so she has a_lot_of those like I'm xxx
because she speaks in a high voice to a baby
and she speaks I mean I don't remember speaking in a high voice to her but we speak in a high voice to the baby and so she does
and um she goes through that whole routine with the baby thing and where she's playing mother um to the point where she was nursing a baby last week
um and we we were really amused
I think the word lap because the baby always sits on the mother's lap but I don't know the turn around things we just use them in conversation and she picks them up
does she do a_lot_of that
other side
turn around
stuff that's very sophisticated
I don't know
see I don't I don't think that we teach her anything
but you know except by what we say
she's in day care right
no no
she wouldn't accept the boy sitting just any old way
on his knees yeah
she was much more sophisticated about the little boy doll for instance this time she calls it a little boy
yeah instead of Humpty Dumpty
Yeah she really does know
if that had been a girl doll
yes by hair
not by any sex parts although she knows there's a big difference because she plays with boys most of the time
with the blocks she used the boy as an agent Does she use her toys to do things for her
she uses me to do things for her usually
it's usually Mommy do it and I have_to urge her to do it so I was interested that she used the boy instead of me
um she still used me
does she have blocks at home that she plays with
um smaller ones
just started to play with blocks
she's not that
she had some sophisticated ideas about what to do with them she wanted to stack them into towers and build bridges does she do that with hers
um I initiated the bridge concept and she still doesn't do that herself
but won't make a bridge herself
um she'll make a tower she knows what a bridge is like she goes under a bridge legs make a bridge
so she knows the concept of a bridge but she's not I don't think she's that manually dextrous
mommy all done
no I'm not done yet
she wanted to take pants off and zipper and change diapers
does she try to do that with her dolls
uh no
I don't like that toy
we have we just have baby dolls
does she do any of that stuff on her own clothing
yes
and Michael's
she wants to zip and unzip my pants and my belt
um she doesn't have a lot you know she doesn't have belts
shoelaces and
yeah uh she's trying to do shoes now
but she um can't do them yet
she can't tie obviously but can she untie
she doesn't try to untie
she knew every picture in the book
yeah
easily
I was amazed
there are pictures in that book I have a hard time with
she doesn't have that book at home so its that she understands the concepts for all those words now
she's very good interaction wise with you
things like
it's Annie's turn
the boy's turn
he do it now
Now has become a big word
she gets on the phone and says
Daddy come home now
yeah well we're trying to share now because she has lots_of people to share with
she's entered that stage when everything is
mine
when she says
Annie's turn
does she really
yeah
yes
but she would never say it's Mike's turn
but she said it was Mommy's turn
yeah well she likes to play with me
she also used comparatives
sit down like Annie
yeah
yeah a_lot_of
like me
like Annie does
like she wants to be like someone else is
if someone's bigger
so like
mommy does
www
again again again again
she likes to really repeat uh like songs I mean we'll sing the same song ten times
and she asks for help now
right
does she help other kids
um a very small baby like she'll help Peter my nephew's um seven months she helps him do everything I mean much too too vigorously
but no one her own size she's really not sharing very well
I don't think
she was very into opening it and closing it Is she into investigating at home
yes
yes and turns everything on and it's getting difficult like around the stove opens every door takes out every thing and leaves it all over the the you know floors she's very into a huge array of things around her
does she then put it back
that's one of the phrases that she talks about
well we try
Yes
she'll put one thing back
she likes things in their place
if its something like a coat she always insists that I hang it up
but when it's all her toys all over the floor she's not the slightest bit interested in putting things back
she had other interesting concepts
at one point she said to you
this is too heavy
you were taken aback by that one
where do you think she grabs terms like that
well because lots_of times I'll tell her that something
for instance we've been putting in a garden
I'll tell her that the wheelbarrow is too heavy for her
but she insists on trying it anyway
um proving to herself that she can't carry groceries in the house those kinds of things
she remembered the dragon
you know I I almost mentioned it to her this morning and then I thought you'd have different toys so I didn't bother
so um I was surprised
does she have boy dolls and girl dolls at home
um I don't know what she thinks some of them are
I I mean most of them are neuter
except the obvious little girl dolls
well the Humpty Dumpty's I think she considers as boys
what's the date today
she'll be twenty months tomorrow
that big sound after the elephant is my husband makes a huge sound elephant sound that she tries to imitate
I was afraid to hold her off because we're going away on Friday for vacation and I hated to delay you
she calls people up
does she have any special routines
it's always hello the person's name and then oftentimes she has quite long conversations but she always has she often has them on the real telephone
I mean she gets a response
do you think she talks more on the real or the play phone
no on the fake
or on the real one when there's no one on the other end
does she have particular people that she picks to um
call
yeah her father um and then Mark and Christopher who are her cousins
always
she wanted to put the dragon in the high chair
the dragon
oh
She puts everything up in hu do You mean in human things
everything goes every place
but she'll try to make the toys do human things
oh yes
always
she usually reads to the toys
the toys don't usually take um can't usually do anything that's why I was surprised that she wanted him to talk on the microphone But we have been trying to take turns so maybe she figured The Raggedy Ann seems to be her favorite
can you put everything into the box for us
she thought the spoon was a kite
no the steam coming out_of the the steam coming out_of the cereal looked like a kite to her
the kite tail
then you told her it was steam and that meant it was hot does she know that
she knows about steam because we she oftentimes will in real steam she knows what real steam looks like
but I'm not sure she's ever seen steam in a book
because lots_of times things are too hot and the stock phrase is
I'm going to separate this with my spoon to let the steam out
is the phrase
so she knows what steam is
you were pointing out a_lot_of trucks to her
um we've seen all of them
but she doesn't use the words for them
she only knows fire engine and truck
the dump truck she knows
but not a crane
she's not especially interested
Yeah a_lot_of kids do but she doesn't seem to be very interested
and she was confused about the snowman
cow's on the next page
I don't know
I'm surprised she doesn't know snowman but I guess she doesn't remember from last year
I know for a fact that when my brother in+law babysat for her they read a snowman book
so I was a little surprised she didn't know what that was
I think sometimes she has trouble it used to be she knew everything in the books but when she saw them in real life she didn't connect the book thing to the real life thing
now it seems like if she's seen it in real life she has a much easier time recognizing it in a book
I don't think she's ever seen a snowman a real snowman I know well cow's on the next page
she wanted the boy to sit on her lap wanted to sit on the boy's lap what is this about sitting on laps
she's back into sitting on laps
it's just a routine
she's uh kind of regressing I don't know what you call it
she I think she's going through a stage although I don't know much about stage
I don't know anything about stages in children yet
but she's getting quite um difficult to separate from me which is too bad because she's gonna be going to nursery school for a couple of days a week
the lunch box her nephew got a lunch box
and we keep telling her that when she goes to school she can have one
She's quite she loved that lunch box
she's been a couple of times to try her out
she understood that Marco was going on some sort of vacation
yeah she understands them
talked about them before I was hoping that she would talk about it because she has talked about it
also I wanted her to get used to the fact that she's not going to see him for a couple of weeks
because she really is attached to this Marco beyond belief
yeah a cousin who abuses her terribly
she understands going on a boat I think she understands fishing I mean we've done it
she has had a fishing pole and
well she's had someone else's fishing pole they play on the beach as opposed to eating sand last year
Play in the waves you know
make castles in the sand all the things that children do Finally
is she into building
she tried to build with blocks
um not a lot
she builds with blocks but
not creatively
mostly it's
what would you say is creative
um she doesn't make bridges she stacks
you asked her at one point how many blocks there were
she's not counting much these days
although she was the last time she was here I remember She doesn't care
does she ask
how many
that's something you do with her
no I don't think she asks how many usually
oh she'll pretend sometimes to be counting if there's a bunch but
and she'll always go by rote one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
but um I don't think she's connecting them
she was having some trouble with the buttons
yeah she's
what did you tell her
slide it through the hole
does that seem to help her when you give verbal instructions
usually
but I was showing her as_well
and then she was doing the zipper that she remembered the name of
she wanted to well she wanted to undress him and she zipped it up
at one point she called the doll Marco and you said Oh is that the doll's name
does she name her dolls
uh yes
they have some names
some of them have names
one is dolly
that's the dolls' name Dolly I figured um and one is Raggedy
because it's Raggedy Ann
and then you talked about going to the doctor and she said
is he going to fix my thumb
she had a thumb operation
she wanted to know if he was going to fix Peter's thumb
now she thinks that everyone who goes to the doctor she had an opera a thumb operation
now she thinks that everyone who's going to the doctor is going to have a thumb operation she said it a couple of times this week because people have been going to the doctor's because everyone we know has been sick
she must think people have strange thumbs
she wasn't very interested in the vocabulary book
yeah she wasn't
I'm surprised
I I think she's not paying much attention today
but I'm not going to make excuses sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't
she's not super she doesn't sit and listen to books as much as some children I know
the only thing she pointed out spontaneously I think was the turtle on the blocks
you mean my asking
what is that
what was the discussion about something sitting on the turtle
sure
she went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago with us and you know she went to sit in the chair and all that kind of stuff and at the dentist's office there's a crocodile that has a you may not have known this because I didn't I it completely eluded me in a book that we have Birds apparently clean crocodiles' teeth so you oftentimes see a crocodile with a bird on his head
it's kind of like a symbiotic relationship
we have a book called crocodile tears which she's always enjoyed and it has a picture of how rude the crocodile is because he had a little bird come and pick his teeth and it always eluded me prior to this thing so when I saw the bird sitting on top of the turtle it just cracked me up
it didn't crack her up
but it cracked me up because it looked like looked like you know the bird was going to be picking the t the turtle's teeth
of course the turtle doesn't have any teeth
yes all the time
well she's just she's into books into reading a lot
so what do I do when I go through the books and we've read through them several times
she's very familiar
she will actually point
Uh I started it out just asking her where is the bird where is Bambi where is Dumbo
and she'll point out at them and now she will actually say and point as you go along
ah it's all Walt Disney characters and Walt Disney books and we have a slew of them
so its that's basically what we've been going through and colors
she loves colors she knows green and blue
you know blue
ya know what color's yellow
can you find me something yellow
she can say yellow
lalas and lolly is yellow
red she can say but she says a weird word
sounds something like shabby For red I'm not sure why
yeah right I think it has something to do with strawberries because strawberries were red and that was her strawberry word
but pink uh she's really good with pink and green
they are perfectly good she can
yes black
wow
uh she has some soft ones that we really don't play with because they don't stack
they're folded
I think you saw them they're kind of made of cotton
they're really nice material
they have Winnie the Pooh with them and Micky Mouse and Donald Duck on them and cloth and they're really nice homemade but she doesn't play with them
yes you like stacking these don't cha
are they all there
sure
she can throw them they're great
she can stack them and knock them over and they don't hurt anything
She has the little round plastic and little square plastic they've holes in them they have sticks
and they're really
that's where we really got into colors because they're such bright colors
and she's starting stacking those up the little things around the house about two months ago
and every time I walk into a room I see xxx another civilization had been here
right we have a cat and a dog so she's familiar with both
she feeds the dog all the time
from her chair when she's eating
and she's getting into combing everything
we hide her brush and xxx everything in the crib and a blanket
no we call Scooby is she calls Scooby Boo_Boo now
she started calling him Booby
yes right that's Scooby
and Gus is Gus Obi is another cat
she Obi's our Grandma's cat
that's Grandma
Pata is grandma
strange
no it's probably just just xxx just say eggie xxx
you start putting the i e on it because it begins to be an easier thing to say for her whenshe picks to pick it up
so that's how I started doing it
she xxx dog
Puppies and dogs and she started calling them woowoo
It's terrible you pick up the kids' language
no
not at all
she has no idea what a dragon is
oh
because it was a dragon
do ya know where your nose is
show us your nose
show us your nose Cindy
be smart
she's aware of her nose and her knees her toes
we started doing we c we're doing the hokey+pokey at the pool and part well well it's not even just the hokey+pokey but it's the rest of the thing
she says put your hand on your head put your hands on your hair
she'll she knows hair and hat and hand and ears
yeah she knew those
I haven't used those for a while
I stopped doing that
those are the things I had done a couple of months ago with her
it's okay to do it with her she asked you to
she has her own little phone and all she says is hi and bye
when we call up someone she'll pick her phone up while we're on the phone imitate us but she won't say anything
hi and bye is it
no not really
she's talked to him on the phone actually when he's in New York
and she well she doesn't talk to him
she just listens and she knew it was him
and she would say
Daddy Daddy
afterwards and point at the phone and Wh
daddy's doing tape recordings now too and she we've got him on the tape recorder so when I turn that on she goes
Daddy Daddy
so_that she makes all these good connections
so I'm sure she knew it was his voice on the phone
and she's talked to her grandma over the phone just you know listening to them talk on incessantly
she doesn't say anything to him except bye maybe at the end of it
cats and dogs and mice
ducks
birds
elephants
Dumbo All of xxx animals Oh yes
we have a little selection these little plastic pigs and cows are just gone
she can say Moo for cow I have_to take her to Drummond farm I heard that's really great
for that sort of thing
peter Magic because he has all these little magic things on him and he's a he
so I called him Peter
ah she could untie the laces
I she doesn't take any you know interest in untying anything else
yeah she doesn't do that she has a zipper on a little case but she just leaves it there
she really has no desire to open it
no either one
yeah
she does
she knows the difference between little boys and little girls out in the street and in the stores
because she starts saying baby about everybody
I there were the kids who were at the age where their mommys don't want you to say baby anymore because they were walking around and bigger than her
so I started saying
little boy little girl
yes
we have the tulips growing outside and she helped me pick one the other day put it in her room
the daffodils just came out and the roses are starting to grow
it's the bush she can't touch
so luckily we live around those things
and rose and tulip it's a yeah I think I think she can understand groupings of little things like that
I I really do
it's a pretty bright green phone xxx
lion in the cage in the Dumbo book but it's nothing that well she's paid much attention to I think she likes the tents and balloons better
she uses flair pens and p
she can draw circles now
it's really great I can't believe it
she's drawing all over everything though
ah no I had I gave her crayons but she eats them so I give her flair pens now
and it works out much better
yeah with the flairs and with the ink pens and pencils she'll pick these up too
I haven't given her the crayons lately maybe I should try that again
but she loves to draw
we've got lots_of colors that she knows
she knows all her colors
yes
just just like we did before but now instead of having to ask she picked up a beach ball the other day and told me every color even white
it's great
seems to come through
what were the first colors she learned
pink
and green were the very first colors and orange seemed to come on after that
red was the hardest
but red she can say now
I think she just had difficulty saying it
and um white didn't seem to be that hard to understand and black seemed to be okay
nothing is black when you ask for colors usually
the only things she wanted to do with the Peter magic doll were his shoes and his zipper
she zips bags up and down she has her little bags
just a sec I'll give it to ya
there ya go grapes
geps
now you can go play with the books okay
go look through those books
they're new
we haven't seen those books before
we have a ton of books at home and she can tell me exactly which books they are there are some great ones called hand hand finger thumb and it has monkeys in it and
hand hand
that's her favorite
does she have any of these books at home
no no none of these
in the alphabet book there were some words in there that were terribly appropriate for her and others that were terribly inappropriate for a child her age
do you have a sense that there were some words she could really identify with and others that she probably didn't
yeah that book especially
we have a doctor Seuss's abc book and they they ya just they just have different examples and they have more or less the ones the kids can you know relate to
this it does it's a little over the heads I think for her age
what words especially were in it that she
um well words like vanilla ice cream I'm I'm not sure you know that's something we don't have ice cream at home and so she's not really familiar with that vanilla ice cream and um and jello is something it's a word she's
I thought that was a good word because it's not in our book
our book has something like jelly jars and jam and she's not really certain about that sort of thing
except she knows what jelly is
but um
on the other hand one of the books on meals had lots_of sinple words for example you called her attention to the red bib does she wear a bib at home
yeah and she's pretty good about y yelling for it
bib
bib
gimme that bib
I try to not have her wear it lately because she's been eating outdoors or eating over at somebody else's house and picnics and that sort of thing so she only has it when she's sitting down eating a meal in her high chair
she talks about drinking the milk up out_of the cup does she use a cup to drink her milk
yeah she does she has a little blue cup
and ya drink you juice out_of it too
there was a routine on feeding something to the dog
does she feed the dog
she feeds the dog all the time
everything she's not supposed to
her meal
she'll feed the dog she'll pick out all the good stuff here's some liver
here Scoob have some good stuff
you said to her at one point who do you see in the mirror
have you practiced that
that's hard for many of the children to do
um she plays with mirrors all the time
just I always did when I was a little kid and I remember my own fascination from it so when she was in a play+pen I've always given her unbreakable mirrors to sort of play with and she's gotten into looking at lights or looking at the window or finding daddy in them or finding mommy in them
besides herself
do you think you help her by asking
who do you see
oh yeah well first of all when you look in a mirror the bath+room mirror of course you're always holding her up and washing her face or something and I was always making a reference to
there's Cindy
or
look at Cindy
so she could see how dirty her face was or wasn't so I could wash it
and she would be more pleased if it were dirty to let me wash
so that's worked out very well
there were a_lot_of words about the garden and that happened last time too you pointed out different types of flowers the garden the colors of things the dirt what kinds of things is she aware of in the garden
we have strawberries in our garden
she's very aware of those because they're growing the flowers have just started to come out and my marigolds my roses
go stack your blocks
pick all the blocks up
has she started to work more with her own shoes
well shoes yes
she tries to put them on and she tries to put her clothes on her pants that's really cute it's a little struggle yes she still needs help getting dressed and everything she doesn't totally undress herself when I'm gone either
but she helps me when sh when I'm undressing her like getting ready for a bath I mean she'll help
she's always very good when you dress her
ya tell her to put her arms through the holes and she will do that
and she's gotten her left leg because the doctor says always
left leg
she likes the phone
does she play with the phone now she was last time
yeah well her daddy's talked to her
he's been back and forth in New_York with his band so he calls every once in a while
and she talks to him it's really cute
will she actually talk on the phone
she'll tell him what she's done in two or three words like if she's gone out stroller riding
she went to the ocean she told him ocean
it so funny
what did she see there
what did she like
what'd you see at the ocean
I mean at the aquarium
sUk
fish
did you see shark
sUk
big shark
sUk
really neat
do you think she knows that they're fish
yeah she did appreciate them as fish
she knew they were fish and we saw the movie which was really kind of neat afterwards about the whale
and that kinda gives you an even better perspective because those fish are real big
sUk
and the sharks were there
since they redid it I hadn't been there for a long time you can really stand way above it and dive in
sUk
you saw the sharks didn't ya
sUks
she didn't enjoy the book on trucks very much you said this is a truck that comes when it snows does she understand
she remembered when it snowed and she had a snowman book I I guess it stopped snowing about the time that we got this book so she remembers very well when it did how and when it didn't
we'd always go out and make a point of it when it did
in one of the books there were lots_of things she knew www
are those things she has had experience with or have you made a point of teaching
no she's just those are things that she's had experience with with food and she's been in the car a lot
is she fascinated with keys
she doesn't really play with my keys very much
she knows what they are I don't think she really cares that much about them they're they start the car and they get you in the house
she was very much into playing with balls last time
balls yes
balls are great
in a couple of the books you pointed out yarn
does she know what yarn is
I have yarn but it's in balls so that's why I said
balls of yarn
when I talk to her about it
she always points to it she knows kittens play with it she knows it unravels it's very funny
and she knows her eggs because she probably eats them every day
she loves eggs
don't cha
hm
and she's very much taken with ducks these days
loves ducks

okay sure
she's really into the books now
is that true generally
she has tons of books
Walt Disney books every story and she just loves to read all day long and go through them in her crib when she's supposed to be napping I can hear her in there and she's saying what is in the books what we've read to her
we have the cat in the hat she'll repeat in the cat in the hat all the things that they picked up in the order and I'm not sure how she knows them
I don't remember
she's incredible
she seems to have a good memory for this sort of stuff
she has an incredible memory
does she have any favorite ones
um well the cat in the hat the rhyming books she doesn't like anymore there were some um doctor Seuss other rhyme books that she used to like
mom came in
would you please go now
was one then she liked that really well and then it just got so she doesn't pick that up so often
she loves Mickey mouse books happy birthday book that's the best
am pwe mIki bwUks
when's her birthday
September ninth
she was two a couple of weeks ago
some of the books were just names of things books
she seems to have acquired quite a large vocabulary although I couldn't always tell what she was saying do you think she had any particular problems with any of those any of the pictures or words
no not really
she's very aware
you're getting very specific with her now she's talking about things like
what are things for
what is the cup for what are the keys for
what type of chair is that
do you deliberately try to build up vocabulary that way
I just have we just she just wants to learn
so much it's just so why say the same thing
so does she get things like keys are to drive from you or does she pick it up on her own
she picks up some things on her own some times she knows well she sees where they go
they keys she says
mommy's keys
or
daddy's keys
and basically mine open the house and daddy's drive the car
you know he has more on his key chain
but she makes some up where they go but she's got a bit of imagination don't cha
this time unlike last time instead of calling the kitties kitty you called them
cat
oh
she's getting older
she still calls it a kitty or kI di
have you decided she's too old for words like that
no I the cats are growing up the kitten that grandma had is now a cat and our cat's an eight year old cat uh it's just she's getting older and there
um he was kitty
I think kitty was easier to say for her as a beginner but i e or y words eee on the end was easier to say than just cat
she called the pancakes
cakes
does she think they look like cakes or is she only getting part of the word when you say it to her
no she says
pancake
I don't think she thought it was a cake
and then you said
hot+cakes
it started with an h in the book
there's another different word for the same thing
she couldn't figure out what the jelly beans were you named them for her
has she ever seen a jelly bean
no I try not to show her those things
we try not to
lollipops are about the only thing she's gotten into and maybe one piece of chocolate
but no I try to steer clear of those aisles
then there are words in these books that she has no experience with
yeah that's true yeah
at the end of the book she pointed to all of the things and she called them all
toy
she understands things are toys
yes they are she has her toys she has her books and she has other things that are that other categories and I'm not sure what the categories are
some parents say they make a distinction by saying
that's not a toy
I probably said that about some certain things around that she shouldn't have played with there are daddy's tape recorder so that's not a toy do not play with it it's a and I try to explain to her what it is it's a mechanical piece of equipment and she doesn't know how to deal with and when she learns how to run it she can play with it then
but it is not a toy
she wasn't real interested in the truck book
no
she was interested on on the mass pike this morning
about the buses and trucks going by but not the trucks
we don't have any trucks
I don't have uh the little cars she's played with but that's about it
does she have any boy friends
yes she does
one that's one month younger than her and we're in a play group together so we see Richard every week
oh yeah he's got boy's toys
she does know boy versus girl now she was sort of developing that
yes yes
she's into numbers now she always put one in front of something
one or whatever she'll count to see if it's one two she's doing really well up to four and then five goes a little crazy
I think it has a lot to do with Sesame street and Ernie and Bert
they have the counting
the froggie too
she thought the boy had a ball on his head
a baseball
she thought it had a baseball in his hand Richard plays with baseballs all the time and she thought it was a ball not a hat she's not used to hats
she's never worn one and she's always had so much hair I never bothered with it
she never had a cap
she was really into colors
she's been into colors a lot a long time she walks around and she'll say colors in front of something and the word she's saying like a red chair red spoon in fact like she picked it out in the book what is that it's a red spoon in drawing and coloring we do this all the time she draws different colors of apples red apples or she'll want a green apple
I can't imagine what it will be like pumpkins
www
you tried to point out to her the difference between a regular chair and a rocking chair does she know the difference
we have a rocking chair and a regular chair at home with rockers on the bottom
she didn't really know what you were getting at
she doesn't just know flowers she knows kinds of flowers
from the garden
the garden's been great
not really because basically all that's zinnias or marigolds they're alright
I'm not sure I tell her what they are the roses only came out only two they just came out about a week ago so she got_to see another rose and vine but the zinnias and the marigolds they're about six feet tall they're just way above her head and all she wants to do is pick the flowers when she goes out
I'll pick this flower
www
well she used to wear one they're around they're still in the house and I try if she's wearing something nice I would put it on her but I usually feed her in her jammies
and she's pretty neat now with eating so it's not that necessary
she talked about having
toast and tea
is that what mother has for breakfast
yes
very familiar
most kids call it coffee
I don't drink it
no we don't have it around
she's used to tea you know not coffee
and eating toast in the morning
oh yes
it's in the car right now
www
do ya wanna sit down on that chair
you can sit down on that chair if you like
she doesn't eat out_of glass bowls the big bowls like that and we really have a lot more plates than we have of bowls her her dish is a plastic dish with the three sections in it or a wooden bowl it's a very flat wooden bowl she eats soup out_of the plastic three sectioned plastic bowl but it's a whole different very obvious bowl and she does eat soup out_of it
does she eat with all utensils now does she know spoon and every thing else
she's not sure what a knife is but I don't let her have one so but a spoon and a fork she can differentiate
she wanted to eat something really weird with a spoon
she's getting really good at zipping up and zipping down does she do much of that now
zips the bag
s her bag
she zips that up and down um she unties real well
she's just beginning to put shoes on her self like her tennis shoes she knows to pull the tongue up to make sure the strings are untied before she sticks her foot in she's starting to take off sweaters all by herself and shirts that she can undo but not the buttoning she hasn't really paid much attention to buttoning
and buckling
her clothing what does it have
it's mostly like this
just pullover very let's see the blue jeans now have zippers in them they were just the elastic back sort of corduroy pants blue jeans or whatever
can she get in and out_of them
the pants
she hasn't really tried
so she comes to you
yeah
she's doesn't really care you know one way or the other whether she has any clothes on
she doesn't make any it not really
she doesn't like to take anything off
she's just happy with what she's wearing
my little nudist
www
she can zip things up but not down
that's because when you zip down when you zip these pants down it's it's open at the top and it is hard unless you hold the top to get the zipper down
well she's not really sure that's what she should do first
think what I've noticed with the bag she's she's been really good at unzipping them
but not zipping it back up
she didn't do much with the blocks but she was interested in reading them
no and we have some beautiful wooden blocks too that she just got and she she the only thing she'll make with them is she'll lay them flat on the floor and make a house to sit on not stack
whereas the little boy Richard came over to the house and he grabbed the blocks and he started automatically playing with them and stacking them on top on top of one another
and she just has no desire to build
but she was interested in reading the blocks and she knew something for every letter
just from reading the books
b is for boo+boo
she started doing that
I xxx with the drawing like just draw the c and the c is for Cindy and then d and then she started the doctor Seuss a c b book too it goes through the a b c d part and I didn't like the words so would add something she was familiar with like Cindy or d for daddy and
what kind of words would you have exchanged
what was the b originally
no she ended up finding out b for boo+boo herself the dog's name is Scooby though boo+boo but she calls her boo+boo
but she picked up the b for boo+boo herself and c for Cindy is really hard
it's a weird letter
and cookie starts with c
yyy
yeah he's your friend
she was pretty good at identifying the animals on the sides of the blocks
you talked about combing and brushing can she comb or brush her own hair
she tries
she has the brush usually the opposite way
she has the hard part down on her head and the bristles sticking up in the air
but she tries
and sometimes she gets the hair
is it easier for her to do it to someone else
for her to do it to someone else
I don't know she's
yeah she can get the brush the right way but it's hard for her to brush my hair because she ends up tangling it up as she's doing it
but she's tried dogs and dolls well the dog has such slick hair that it will xxx comb it's not fuzzy
and Gus is so soft it's not like he has anything to comb either
can she pretend that she's feeding a doll at this point
yes
she she had a pretend tea party and she fed all of her little animals that were on the table great
she was making all the little out_of play+dough
oh we had gotten some clay recently she's been playing with that and making things out_of it and hot+dogs because they're easiest to roll around but mostly she makes daddy mommy boo+boo Gus the family and then a Cindy and maybe a Richard or a Jeffry her little friends that she knows
www
she'll say it and it'll be sort of a little weird however I repeat it so she'll get the idea that this is really how it's said
then when she can say it again she usually cleans it up a little bit
do you have_to say
say it again
or does she do it herself
if you say the word over again does she repeat it
sometimes sometimes she doesn't
depends on what time she feels
but she often will
uh books
she's got several books not like this
this is one of the cutest books I've ever seen it's a an old one
it's cute
um she's got one of these she likes to put things uh you know but she doesn't have any she has a Raggedy Ann doll but she's got some stuffed animals but two cats
um I don't I really don't know if she's that familiar with dogs
uh there is a dog where she sometimes goes to the baby+sitter named Suchi um in fact he looks like that little stuffed dog but I don't really know if she sees him there or not
one of them's kitty and the other one has another name
um no we just started calling it that and
yeah very small ones
she stacks them
throws them
carries em around as many as she can at once
um I thought she might know kitty but that's about the only thing
I don't think so
she might know boy
she's been exposed to ducks but I don't know how well she knows those she loves them
she brings them to me and makes me go through them over and over
and you know sometimes she sits
like that by herself
she looks at them
she's got a Raggedy Ann and a another soft no she's got three of them and a big one but she just isn't interested
yeah just sit around
um not as much as we used to
um just uh peekaboo and you know behind uh objects or sometimes when she's eating in her high chair I don't know
it's just you said it was a dragon so I just thought of it as being a dragon
yeah I know what you mean I
it just never occurred to me to think of you know it's a dragon so that's what I called it
she has a puppet
sometimes she likes it
she'll make that little noise like she made with the dog
very loving to it and other times she could care less about it
no and that was a new routine I'd never done that with her
yeah she feeds herself
yeah combs and brushes she'll brush her hair she'll try to brush my hair
oh did I
I just called it a bunny because it said bunny on it so I don't think I've ever no
I think I've always used the word bunny no rabbit
yeah it seems like an easy thing to memorize you know one two three four I don't think so
yeah she has a number book at home one raccoon two something it goes through a list of animals
seven bunnies
yeah she lifts it up and goes that allo allo allo you know
and whenever the phone rings if like sometimes her father calls from work and all that I'll put it to her ear and let her hear his voice
she never says a word but a big smile comes on her face
she's got two toy ones
one of them's just like this a different color and the other one is more of a pull+toy it kind of it has little eyes on it that roll up and down and makes kind of a clicking sound when you pull it and its its vividly colored
I really don't know
she used to wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house with it
so but she does do that
hello hello
s so you know so as though she had some connection
she runs to the phone
it's a big event
it's not when she's done playing
it can happen any time
with any number of things she likes to put things in drawers and shut the drawers I'll find toys in dresser drawers and just all over the place
she likes to seems to like to put things in a an orderly way
not every time um once in a while I tell her but she does it on her own for the most part put it away something like that
I think she knows put
put it away yeah
she wasn't too entranced with the phone this time she wasn't last time either
I don't think so
she has one at home right like it
uh Just like it
go put those on a chair Go on
go get them
does she use it
not really
I think the novelty's worn off
what does she do with a real phone
she immediately runs to where it is
and gets all excited
loves to pull on the cord if I don't keep it out_of reach
and when she listens to voices uh smiles
but won't say a word
does she understand where the voices are coming from
I don't know
does she recognize if you say
Come here and talk on the phone
she'll come well she'll run to it immediately when it rings um she won't talk on it herself
you mentioned playing with the chair and the chair's just like her chair Does she play xxx
no not at all She has a little rocking chair like uh one of the little pictures
do you think she recognizes that it's just like hers
I don't think so
she didn't uh really respond when I yeah
you tried a bunch of prepositions with her
you tried going up putting things in taking things out told her that something was upside down How many of these words do you think she recognizes
I think all of them
she says up all the time
when she wants up
and she says down when she wants down
not as much as up
that's her favorite word um I think she understands almost all of them
I don't think I've used upside down before
she knows to take things out
does she put things in and out
oh yeah
yeah
she'll put things like um her dirty clothes in her clothes basket
she can follow a_lot_of directions put it in there out there
she won't play with the blocks
has the novelty worn off
I shouldn't have done that
I won't get her a dragon
what does she do with blocks when she has them
she stacks them
and oh she loves to throw them that's the latest thing
smaller ones though that she throws
but she's definitely not into them these days
um depends on her mood
um sometimes she is but not today
does she have the Pat the Bunny book at home
no
you say
let's read a book let's look at the pictures
does she understand that concept
yeah for at home she will
yeah
does she have any favorite ones
um she has a little book with nursery rhymes that she really likes
and uh She I don't know she sort a seems like she's losing her interest in books that she had a few months ago She used ta just pester continually with the book you know just follow you around the house but she seems she'll even sit and read one on her own now
read I mean you know look at the pictures
she has about eight or ten books
that's it
again you pointed out boys and girls
probably not
she doesn't say little boy little girl
no not at all
do you make an effort to do that
I don't maybe I do I don't know
I did that I must I did in the book
and maybe I do I didn't think that I do
does she have little boy and girl friends
yes
well mostly little boys actually
there's one little girl but she's a bit older
there's not many little girls around where she is
she tried to smell the flowers
does she try to do that at home in the backyard
I've seen her doing it She likes to touch them I just I just said that because it said smell the flowers
that's the first time I ever said I didn't even know she knew the word smell
you saw her looking in the mirror and said
who's that
do you think she knows
we look in the mirror together I don't know if I say
who's that
maybe I do
do you think she understands that that's her
I don't know
I I'm not sure
She didn't seem to remember what shoes are do you play with them at home
she knows yeah in fact um I don't know if you saw it but she started playing with her own shoes when I said that
she she wasn't interested in the doll's shoes maybe because they don't look like shoes or something
she has sneakers and sandals she brings them to me I say go get your shoes she'll bring them to me
does she try to tie them and untie them
yeah she unties them I have_to double knot them
all the time
does she try to pretty up herself or other people
yeah she'll use a brush on her own hair and in fact if I'm in the bath+room doing make+up or something she'll just always try to grab the brushes and combs
it's one of her favorite things
Does she drink out_of a cup do you call it a cup
some well she has some things I call cups and others that I call glasses
I think she knows cup but um she just wasn't that interested in the pictures so I don't know
but it broke apart and I never got her a new one but whenever she's sees my keys just do anything to get hold of them Lately we've noticed that she offers her cheek for a kiss
so that's they way xxx
you used the term
food
it's a pretty broad term do you think she knows
um I think so When it's lunchtime I'll say let's go let's go lunch Well I'll say
Let's are you ready for lunch
she'll just drop what she's doing and run into the kitchen and shake her high chair
I use eat yes I do I don't think meat comes up very much though
I don't think that means anything to her
she knows no I'll say I'll say
ya want some more chicken
or hot dog or sandwich um food might be to entice her to the table at the very beginning but I am specific about what she eats xxx
yeah she says it too
When she wants more Yeah if she's eating
I don't know
I guess I said
night night
and she can identify with that
feeding it dinner and it's things that she does herself I guess
