okay
very very good honey
you are a great reader
you're great
little miss spider popped pout of her egg
swinging down from a thread she hung on by one leg
watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover
she dangled there wondering where is my mother
did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water
why won't she come out here and meet her new daughter
she climbed to the tippy top of a tree
gazing out on the world she sobbed where can mom be
a beetle named Betty buzzed by this high perch
a child needs a mother may I please help you search
that's beetle Betty
I don't know for sure but
yeah I don't know for but she doesn't know that
I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue if I were your mother I'd be looking for you
they flew through the trees spying down from the sky
and asked all the butterflies fluttering by
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
that is a lady bug
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig
have you seen my mom she's like me only big
the sly spider laughed
that is a spider
as he gobbled his snack
up there is a mother who's yellow and black
with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw
but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried
your dinner is here darlings so open up wide
yikes
oh they think miss spider is their dinner
before she could
she was whisked out of sight and Brave_Bittle Brave_Beetle_Betty was hugging her tight
oh_goodness
Betty saved her
in her warm cozy home
she did
in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree
the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me
then miss
then miss spider smiled and held Betty fast
I looked for my mom and I found you at last
for finding your mother there's one certain test
you must look for the creature who loves you the
best
very good
that's a great book
you wanna read this one again
little miss spider popped out of her egg

Horton hatches the egg
wow
side lazy aside Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
from sitting just sitting here day after day
it's work how I hate it I'd much rather play
I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my nest
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
do you wanna read Chester's way instead
okay
Chester's way
Chester had his own way of doing things
he always cut his sandwiches diagonally
he always got out of bed on the same side
and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes
Chester always had the same thing for breakfast
toast with jam and peanut butter
and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket
just in case
you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother
that's one way to put it said Chester's father
Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way
that's why they were best friends
Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first
Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals
if Chester was hungry Wilson was to
but they rarely ate between meals
some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother
me either said Wilson's father
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
they loved to go on picnics
once when Wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him
Chester swallowed one to
don't worry said Chester if you grow a watermelon plant I'll grow one to
Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway
for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together
salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string
ham and eggs
they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother
looks like it Chester's father
in spring Chester and Wilson shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen to they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
and then Lily moved into the neighborhood
Lily had her own way of doing things
let's not hurt your teeth okay honey
she wore bandaids all over her arms and legs to look brave
she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying
and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises
Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them
and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case
she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester
that's one way to put it said Wilson
when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy
when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home
if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid
she's something else said Chester
looks like it said Wilson
one day when Chester and Wilson were practicing their hand signals
some older boys rode by
well those are some older boys who rode by and they circled
well that's an older boy and he's not very nice
that's Wilson and Chester
and that's an older boy
and that's an older boy
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
right
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
just when they were about to give up hope a fierce looking cat with horrible fangs jumped out of the bushes and frightened the older boys away
are you who I think you are Chester asked the cat
of course the cat replied
thank you Lily said Chester
thank you cat
you're welcome Chester said Lily
thank you Lily said Wilson
right
she was
you're welcome Wilson said Lily
I'm glad you were wearing a disguise said Chester
and I'm glad you had your squirt gun said Wilson
I always do said Lily
just in case
afterward Chester invited Lily over for lunch
you have a muscle mouse cup said Lily
of course said Chester
I do too
right there see he's holding his cup
oh her her cup must be at her house
Chester and Wilson cut their sandwiches diagonally
Lily asked Chester's mother if she had cookie cutters and she made stars and flowers and bells
mhm
and a flower right
is that a flower shape sort of
right
right
mhm
right
that night Lily invited Chester and Wilson to sleep over
you have a night light said Chester
of course said Lily
right there
wow
Chester and Wilson wanted toast with jam and peanut butter for breakfast the next morning
boring said Lily
try this instead
wow this is good said Chester
wow said Wilson
after that when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said yes
right
that's right
sometimes I can't tell these three apart said Lily's mother
me either said Lily's father
Chester and Wilson and Lily Lily and Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
right right
drums
you're right
you're right
Chester has a purple balloon
Wilson has a pink balloon and a drum
Lily has a broom
you're absolutely right
for Halloween they dressed as the three blind mice
for Christmas Lily gave Chester and Wilson nifty disguises
well I think this is Chester because he's brown
this is Lily because she's white
and this is Wilson because he's grey
right right Chester right Chester is wearing one of Lily's boots
and Wilson is wearing the other one of Lily's boots
you have a drippy lollie
right a big picture
in spring Chester Wilson and Lily shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen so they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson and Lily
Lily and Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
and then Victor moved into the neighborhood
