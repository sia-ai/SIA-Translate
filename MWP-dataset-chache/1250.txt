hm
in fact there was a spider in the shower this morning
oh
a daddy_long_legs spider
in your shower
in my shower
oh I think that's because that doesn't get used very much
yeah
so they set up home there
I washed it wash down the drain
daddy_long_legs
why do we call it that
because they have very very long legs
and I don't know why it's called that
you know I don't think those are actually spiders
daddy_long_legs
oh yeah
because I don't think they have the same
there're not enough xxx xxx xxx
ah
you count the number of legs it's not eight legs
why was it in
well maybe it was attracted to the water
probably because I turned the shower on
and it was in the shower
well I think it went down the drain
because it was all wet
well it couldn't swim
xxx xxx
I'm not xxx I saw any
where did I um
take the train when I came with Naima and got picked up by you
you came to Brewster
Stamford

you mean from New York
or did you
oh maybe I'm thinking of where you took me
took me to Stamford
yeah right
you picked me up one place
I took you to Stamford
yeah
and that was after I'd been in New York
or before
xxx let me think now
I think that I
you had been to me and then xxx xxx
I think I went from you to New York
I think that's right
yeah
and that means that I
you picked me up in Stamford
no wait
no because I think
Laura
you came from New York up to Brewster
but I think xxx took me to
the commuter rail
oh
from in New York I got on the train to Brewster
I'm pretty sure
yeah
you came up to Brewster
and then you picked me up
I picked you up but not at
which means that when you picked me up the first time
no wait
I
I rented this car+seat that was there
I know
but
yeah
and then I took you to Stamford
wait who lives
now I'm confused
I'm really confused
well I do know I picked you up in Brewster
you did
yeah
and then I stayed
yeah and then I stayed with you and then you took me to the Stamford
right
to go home

no Stamford is
no Brewster is the closest
but you
no but for me
you wouldn't be able to come

hey you did it
I'm on f one
and you need this clipped
what ever happened to that little purple and pink pouch that you had
do you remember
it's so little it gets misplaced
this is like a beeper like Daddy's beeper
look at this
you look like a little doctor with a beeper
no
okay you can go to bed
you having a backwards day
I'll do a quick buckling in
no I'm not gonna drive
I'm gonna sort the books

okay you're all buckled in
you're a buckled in girl
are you making the car noise yourself
who's in her bed at the hospital
Isabelle
I see
oh
Emma
are you in the hospital Emma
taped up ears
oh did you take that off
come here
how did you take that off all by yourself
what kinds of medicine did you take Isabelle
she slept
today is Friday June fourth two thousand four
Isabelle scratched on the wall
that's cause she hasn't had her second breakfast yet
Isabelle would you like a new puzzle
it has a certain somebody on it that you like
wanna do it together
let's do it in the hall
what kind of a creature is that
yeah
yep
now we can put it together but you know we're gonna have_to take it up so the floor can be washed a little later
should we do it somewhere where we don't have_to pick it up
instead
I wonder how big it is
lemme just see
finished size ten and a third by fourteen and a half
I wonder if we had a really big board we could use it
I have an idea
I have a tray we could do it in
whoop did that come off
here lemme fix it
well
I'm gonna put it on your bottom
turn around
you know what I was thinking
I was thinking a little later if you want we could go to Earthly Delights for you second breakfast
would you like that
really
she could come
I think Naima this tray will work for this puzzle
that way we can move it around and take it off the floor when we're done
see this little tray with the elephants on it
I'm gonna go get the tape recorder and bring it in here
here are all the pieces
spread them all out and put them all face up
lemme
I'll be right back Emma
let's see
no we're gonna do it together
where's my mic
here it is
yeah we'll do it together
um it's plastic actually
it's plastic
alright let's look at that picture that it's supposed to look like
like that okay
mhm
mm this looks like kind_of a hard puzzle
I'm going to
let's see
you know what the easiest place to start I think would be
see how there's pink flowers only on the left side of the picture
why don't we find all the pieces that have part of the pink flower in them
yeah
well put it on the tray
we're gonna make it on the tray so that we can move it when we're done if we want to
here
oh that's a bird
there's pink flower
here's some pink flower
here's some too
first I'm just finding all the pieces
up there's a tiny bit of pink flower in that piece
teeny tiny
this puzzle has sixty pieces
hey you did it
you put three of the pink flower pieces together
well this needs to be an edge doesn't it
what about this
excuse me your hair and head is right in the way
I can't see the puzzle at all
thank_you
there
see that's that edge
and here's a bud
where's this flower bud in the picture
is it
oh it's down there
so I think this is a bottom piece
oh good
that's good
up here's another flower piece
oh you made it connect
this one goes down here because it's this bud
there's two birds so let's look for
let's find all the bird pieces next
oops sorry
I just put all the bird pieces in one spot for now
uh sorry
bird mird
hey we got a lot of pieces together
some fruit of some kind
now let's see
there's a bird near this petal
I think is it
yeah this bird must be near this
and this bird should have more bird body
does this go to this
I think this part
this is this other bird
let's find the birds
mm
here's a bird's beak
I think that goes there
and this might go here
I think
I think this piece
I think I found a beak over there
see
all that piece has is beak
this is another part of a bird
do you think it goes here
mhm
I think we could find a corner piece that might
oh wait
this is a corner piece that must go up here
the bird's body is there
mhm
let's see
hm
let's find other corners
oh wait there's a tiny bit of pink flower
where is that pink flower
mm
xxx is it an edge piece or not
does it have one smooth one flat side
let's look at the picture of the cover on the cover and see where a piece of bud belongs
I got that one up here
up there
oh you're right
and there's fur on it
hey
right there
mhm
oh here's another edge I mean corner piece
I wonder if that's the corner piece for the bottom left
mhm
I think upside down and sideways
like that
and I think this corner piece might go
oh wait maybe not
I think maybe this is the corner piece for this side
I don't know if it goes there
I think we need more fur
we need a bottom piece with more fur
let's see
like that
xxx bottom piece
now see if this corner piece goes
hey
uhhuh
hm
mm you need some white to match that
here's a corner piece
where
oh
how bout up in this part
maybe
we're still missing one more corner piece
let's find the corner piece
hm
I don't see it
wait this is a corner piece
this must go here
probably missing one edge piece here
let's see
hm there's a side piece
that goes there
well it's gotta go right on the edge doesn't it
along that edge I think
wait a minute
I think that's a black ear
I think that goes up here
aha
see look there's the black ear
so that's the top part
mhm
feels like we're missing pieces though
are we sitting on any
oh
you were sitting on one piece
I don't know
oh it looks like the other
is it the other ear
or part of this ear
check here
does it fit in to that
hm
no
does this go here
it does
and that goes there
the whole top edge is done now
Naima how about if that
yeah is it right
no
it's too loose to fit
how bout
I don't think we have a place to put that one yet
it looks like an ear
maybe it's the other
maybe it goes
look and see how the brown branch connects to the black ear
that's this right here
oh
it does go there
yes
I think so whoop
mhm
I checked
I'm not
I'll check again if you want me to
no I'm not
yeah
let's see here
those two go
no they don't go
they look like they go but they don't
no it doesn't go
I don't know
let's find more edge pieces
there have_to be at least a few
this is an edge piece this is an edge piece this is an edge piece
oh a very small amount of pink uhhuh
mm
that doesn't go
sometimes you just have_to try a_lot of pieces and see what what fits
does that go
yeah I guess it does go
that's nice isn't it
oh we still need some edge pieces to be found
this is another edge piece
where it goes I don't know
mm
how bout there
oh that goes
oh I wonder if this now goes here
yay
it's starting to look more like the picture isn't it
that doesn't go there
I think the xxx be
mhm
some black we need an edge piece that has a little black in it
do you see
but that didn't look like an edge piece
this is an edge piece
oh hm an ear
how about on there
will it attach to that ear
I think so
no
are you sure
let's see
you were right it doesn't go there
mhm
certainly the first time you do a puzzle is the hardest I think
do you think so
Daddy will be very surprised
that doesn't go there
hm
that goes
all that bluish
I still don't understand what piece goes there though
cause there's a_lot of fur involved
xxx that doesn't really go
hm
I think we're missing an edge piece that has black in it
those don't have any edges
well I hope we weren't missing a piece when it was a new puzzle
let's lift up and look and see if we
somehow did we miss some
look behind you where the other box is
are there any pieces under that
guess not
okay maybe we're just missing a piece
well we could still put together most of it
even if we're missing
well I wanna keep going
I wanna keep going and see what we can do
that goes there
hm
where's the picture
maybe this maybe this connects over here
no
mhm
mhm
hm
oh this goes here
I think this goes here
oh is it part of an ear
does it go over here
it's got white
the white is part of the face of the panda
does it
mm
it's a little bit loose
how bout
how bout
it's a very white part
but with a little black
I'm not sure we have a place for that
where does the panda have stripes
oh that's not a stripe that's the panda's jaw
so that goes somewhere here
jaw piece
actually that looks right
where's that
oh that's the nose where
see where it gets very very bluish white
that must be the nose
try over here Naima
what about here
oh no I guess not
alright
mm
we got two ears already
oh here's another edge piece
it's really hard to spot them
that goes there I think
this go here
not really xxx
no xxx
this is
oh but this goes here
and this goes here
and we need one more edge piece right there
hm
it must have some white and some black do you see
well that goes there
and this goes this way
I think
uh
we're getting there Naima
we have more
I think more than half the pieces are put together
do you think so
you're right
and it has to be an edge too
hm
oh
this is an edge
try that on the side there
okay that means we've done all the edges
look
all four edges
that's something
at least we did that
hm
it's pretty white isn't it
hm
it's like putting the cars down in the right street
hey
oh
that goes very nicely right there
something must go there somehow
hm it must have some sky and it must have some white
so the bluish and the white it has to have
how about that
no
bluish and has to have some white
oh and it has to have a tiny bit of black
how about this
hm
how bout over here Naima
try it there
well I think
well maybe not
hm
this is not a particularly easy puzzle is it
I'm gonna try this here
how bout there
oh no maybe not cause that's its belly
it has to be a place where there's blue sky
it might go over here somewhere
hey
good job
I think that goes there
hm
Daddy left his tv on downstairs
that doesn't go there
that goes there
let's see that has some white fur and some black
oh that has the eye Naima
you've got the eye piece
how bout there
no it xxx probably go no
well the other eye should be over here somewhere
yes I know I know
that goes there
that's where it goes
we only have one two three four five
I think we have nine
look
one two three four five six seven eight
nine
we're almost done
mm okay
I don't know
you have a runny nose again
good
try this corner
mhm
I think so
hm
xxx we should celebrate when we're done

sixty pieces
that was fun
no let's not
this way we can save it and put it up if we want to save it to look at
you wanna pretend
we didn't
we did it
yep could you count how many more we could fit if we wanted to
you only need
lemme give you a hint
