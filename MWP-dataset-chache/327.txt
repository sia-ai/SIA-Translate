I was thinking that you should just tell him the rules again
no pushing no hurting okay
actually that wasn't the problem
he kept climbing on the roof
we didn't talk to him about that rule
could you please talk to him about that rule
and then there was another thing that he was doing
okay remember how we told him to brush his teeth
he kept going to the refrigerator and putting whipped cream on the toothbrush and brushing his teeth with whipped cream
could you please tell him describe to him what he's supposed to do for brushing his teeth
oh okay now he might listen
should I try him again should I try to take him home again

how did you make them though
how'd you get your name on there

so first you had a yellow name and then you put a blue name on
how come you switched and put a blue name on
oh it wouldn't really show up cause it's yellow and yellow both I see
that is an interesting thing that Ryan's got

I don't know I just found that in the closet over there
hey why did you make those eggs
is there something kind of fun that might be coming up
oh
what do you know about Easter
well does somebody come on Easter
I don't think he really knows about that
we don't really do that
yeah I wasn't sure
yeah but we do know something that happens to Jesus around Easter time
what happened to Jesus
he got put on the big cross yeah
but then what happened a couple days later
do you remember
so that was a good thing right
now this was kind of something that I kind of wanted to show you
now I really don't know what this is but I just found it and I think you kind of have_to build something with it
why don't you open it up and see what's in there
I don't really know what's in here
we'll have_to see
is there
okay
it's never been open before
can you get it out
it must be stuck huh
you think it's a couch that we got_to make
you might be right

now what are these things
see a chair
this is very cute
and what about this
we haven't opened this box though yet
after you open that

yeah a pretend cookbook
that's kind of funny huh
because look what is it missing

do you know what that is
it's actually very cute
I think I might have found something else over in here
look at this
this is so cute
look at this a little tiny toaster with toasts little breads
isn't that cute
I don't think they fit in there though
and this thing is super cute but I don't xxx
it might go to this right here
oh yeah
if it's in the right box it almost looks like more living room stuff
you know what I think that got mixed up cause that's part of the living room right
oh here's something kind of neat
what is that
that looks like a little closet yeah
it's kind of fun opening things
it's kind of like a little Christmas
I don't even know what any of them are I just found all the boxes
when you were searching around huh
oh look at this little tiny thing
it looks like salt in it yup
what's that
that is so cute
an oven yeah
oh wait a minute now we can hook it up
you know did you know that Ryan used to work in the day care last year
he did and I think he probably knows Chris from last year
why don't you tell him about Chris what's going on with Chris in your classroom
she's gonna move where's she gonna move to
yup
is that pretty far away
yeah
how do you know how far it is
oh okay
a little map
and what is on the map now
yeah it has a little map and it has little sticky things and little pins right to show where we are in New York and in California right
do you think kids mostly understand though
yeah
do you know why she has to move
you forget
she's pretty nice isn't she
how do you think someone might feel about Chris moving
you told me something that Nancy said if somebody feels sad and what could happen
do you remember what Nancy said Boo
she said that you could go do something if you felt sad
she was just saying that you could go talk to her right if you felt said you could go talk to Nancy
I think tomorrow is
okay and what was the second thing you remember
you could give her a hug yup
yep you could give Chris a hug
do you know something I know neat about Chris is do you know where she came from before she came here
she lived in another place I think that was very far away
do you remember
there can be grizzly bears in Alaska
that's where she's from
yup
from Alaska
do you know I think I might have saw you yesterday out playing when you were at the daycare
were you guys running up and down a big hill maybe
you were
I think I saw you running up that hill
you were running pretty fast
yeah Matty can run pretty fast
do you know I don't know if Ryan knows about something that we're gonna do later tonight
I'll give you a hint it has to do with our new land
go visit it and do what
and hike
oh
and look for bones yeah and anything else
you forget
well that's okay
you and Daddy when you went a couple weeks ago you got something very very interesting do you remember in the rocks
what do they have sometimes in the rocks there
you forget
remember the little fossils
shell fossils in some rocks it is very interesting
that sounds pretty neat
mhm
do you like hiking in the woods
yeah
oh I should close that door cause otherwise your car might go all the way outside
well I'm trying to think about another things that's gonna be happening in a day or two
do you remember about what you and Daddy are gonna do
go I'll give you a hint
what's this
outside
oh okay
kind of like in a swimming pool yup
you're gonna go to a very big water park
in Pennsylvania they have it
oh I've been there before
you've been there before
mhm yup
really
it's fun
very interesting
and then I'm trying to think of what else has been going on
yeah you can play with whatever you want Matty
well there's something very interesting that's going on in your room
oh you got a new light
really
it's very old old wires and we noticed so we took it apart so we got a new one
so a dinosaur room
what did we buy that would make your room like a dinosaur room
oh_my_goodness
and also what's gonna be on the walls
remember it's gonna have like a wall paper border
yep
that's gonna be a pretty cool room
yup they've been working on it all week long
did Daddy have_to work this week
in his real work
yeah did he have_to work in his real work this week
no
so he's working at home
what else was he doing this week do you know
I know he was working in my office
isn't that super funny
how come he was working there
how come he wasn't at his real work
he is pretty busy
I think that's pretty cool you're getting a dinosaur room
I think that would be pretty neat
yup we're looking forward to it
can you show me
ah I don't really know what that is
should we look and see what that is
I think you know what
I think it's a microscope because if these are little things you look into and it's gonna have see she's looking at different things like buds pinecones
this is actually very interesting
let's see what age it's for okay this little microscope thing because that seems like something you might like
some of the stuff they have is for babies though so let's see if it's a good age for you
I don't know
you know what
I think that Ryan has to put stuff back in there so we don't want those xxx okay
oh look at this
a sandbox
how come I don't see the microscope in here
that's strange isn't it
I do not see it
I don't know why I don't see it
do you see it anywhere
nope that's a xxx
you have one of these look look look
little buses they're little buses for little people
have you ever ridden on a bus before
that's a good question
have you ever ridden on a bus before on a real bus honey
I don't think so
but he has been on a
wow
do you remember what happened with the train
do you remember where we visited
you know what that is supposed to be
a pretend video camera
that's kind of cute you know to take videos but that's not real it's just pretend
like a pretend one or a real one
let's see what the age thing is
two to six years so that seems like a good time for you because how old are you now
yep so that might work
oh it's learning how to tell time with the clock well that would be convenient
oh here it is the microscope set
it's a microscope science set
three to seven years old that seems like something you would like huh
how about for your birthday
okay
I'll look at that though
that is really cute
that looks like a good thing you'd like it has all kind of things about nature
I don't know I think it belongs to Ryan
I won't forget about it
oh it could be
it could be
yeah you're right because cupcakes come in those little containers except cupcakes are usually a little taller
do you want me to tell you what I think it is
I think it's supposed to be a pretend pie
you thought it was a real pie
why don't you try it and see
yeah see if it's a good pie
that's not a real pie
this one is a mystery though what is this supposed to be
oh it could be a doughnut
a giant doughnut it's the same size as the pie
that's a very big doughnut huh
do you like doughnuts
I like them too
where are you going
okay
you know we got a new video this weekend that Ryan might be interested in
whoa have you seen it yet
is it pretty good
what do you think is the scariest part of that movie
well what's one part that's scary
snakie
now see Ryan might have not seen it
no
what happens with the snake
he does
and then what happens how does he kill him
oh he did
that sounds like a scary part
there's another part that's super scary too
can I whisper it to you
tarantulas tell him about what happened with the tarantulas
oh_my_goodness
what did Harry Potter do then
wow
they were so lucky the car came
Harry Potter sounds like he's pretty brave
do you think he's pretty brave
I think so too
what are tarantulas
I'm not really sure
okay okay
you gonna play with that part
that's pretty cool
I was I was trying to catch it
there you go
oh my where did it go
it just went behind me okay
oh there you got it
so have you been playing outside now that it's finally getting warm out
yeah
me too
did you wear a coat outside today
oh your black and white coat and also your brown coat
did you wear a hat too
that helped a lot didn't it
yeah
you've been helping Daddy outside with some stuff too do you remember
you're just saying I forget
okay Daddy's been setting up something very new in our yard with some grapes
what were you helping daddy do
water them
you were spraying your eyeball out
did you spray your dad
you did
he did he said if you got him wet he would throw a bug at you
did he actually do that
no
were there bugs outside I don't even know if there were any bugs
hey you know what I did this weekend Matty
I went fishing
have you ever been fishing Matty
yeah
did you catch anything
oh okay
that's true
what'd you do with it
yeah
that's nice
I didn't catch anything either when I went but we tried
where did you go fishing
where does your daddy take you
do you know what town it is
it's the same town as your new school
do you know what town it is
Dunkirk yep that's where we went fishing
so that's why we wouldn't keep the fish
you don't want to eat the fish that come out of that lake
well that's kind of a dirty lake
but we did go to the lake the other night
Ryan doesn't know about this either
this was the coolest thing
remember we went by the beach and then Matty was climbing on the cliffs
do they have pretty big cliffs down there
do you remember about the cliffs Boo
yeah because you might have falled off the edge yes pretty dangerous
oh I caught it
good catch
yeah we were hiking and we were really being careful right Matty
yup
do you remember what else we did with a big big stick
what else did we do at that lake
yeah we threw it in for a bridge for the birds
what kind of birds were down there
seagulls
they make a lot of noise don't they
well sometimes they do when there's a bunch yeah
we don't really haven't seen too many like all together but there are some that are pretty loud
oh_my_goodness
we used to always feed them
I know it almost hit you in the head
do you wanna play with the store thing
okay
oh did you buy that
did you buy the ball
here let me throw this away
you know another thing we've been doing that Ryan does not know about is that we went to go see a movie on Sunday
Piglet
Piglet's Big Movie
does that bounce pretty well or no
oh_my_goodness I dropped it
that's hard to catch
do you remember about Piglets Big Movie what happens in that movie
Piglet gets lost and then
well was he lost right at the very end
at the very end
I think they find him
remember they're all together at the end
what did his friends do for him that was super nice
they made all lots_of
like what
like that picture
you got a big nose
that is a very big nose
oh no
oh really
see I thought that was your nose
so we actually they had a very busy time and Ryan was with me at the conference actually but remember when we were at the conference and you and Daddy and Roman went somewhere
it was an exciting day
I'll give you a hint
remember you went
I wasn't at Marissa's party so what did you do there
I triget
well what do you usually do at a birthday party
I know what you do
eat cake
what was the snack
I think it's on the table by the wagon
this table right over here over by that little wagon
that's a very cool ball
birthday parties are pretty fun
was it her birthday
yeah
so at Marissa's you had a snack and then what did you guys also have
did you have like cookies or pie or something
look what you found
should we open it up do you think
okay
was it
you'll never know what you'll find in there huh
that's okay
no you didn't
we'll find it
this is very interesting
what is that
oh you're right
do you want me to get it open for you
remember Matty we're gonna bring in that big new bookcase for your room
won't that be cool
so that you can have more books in your room
hey look a school set in the bedroom set box
isn't that silly
and we found kitchen stuff in the other box
yeah
that's pretty neat
let me see what stuff is in there
see I think that's supposed to be in his room though
see look look
see there's school stuff in his room maybe because he's supposed to do his schoolwork or something
maybe
did that hurt your mouth
a staple
can I see
okay let me see
oh yeah you hurt yourself didn't you
yeah
wow look at all those books in there
I'm gonna dump them out
that's really cute the little tiny bookshelf
these are cute
a little eraser I know
is your finger okay
do you want a napkin on that is it bleeding
do you want a little napkin for that
yeah
did you see Ryan brought you a snack
are you hungry
do you want me to give it to you
okay
sure anything you find in there you can bring on out
okay while I get the things for you then what
and then you'll look for stuff
okay
oh my a lot of stuff are you finding more of those boxes
hey Boo you know what
you found your ball
you know what
you can open one more of those and then we actually gotta go home because remember we're gonna go visit our new land
okay
it looks like another living room set
isn't that funny
oh_my_goodness so that's a different set isn't it
cool another table
these are really interesting
I wonder
it's weird that he bought a whole nother set of these isn't it
because he has the whole doll set doesn't he
yep
look at these little things
you're gonna try to open those two
okay
uh oh you know what
you have_to be real careful with the boxes okay
because if they get ripped it's not easy to put them all away
what's in there
oh another table
okay Boo should we help Ryan put some of these things away quick
quick
quick
quick as a what
what's something that goes fast
quick as a
quick as you can run
hey that's what I was gonna say quick as Matty can run
you know Ryan used to be a runner too
yep
oh I don't know if I could run as fast as you were running the other day
you were running pretty fast
Matty remember when we saw the other day when the hockey team won a big trophy
remember that
I'm not sure what those are for
we watched the hockey game you know the national hockey game
you wanna borrow that car
you had that idea before remember that
so I just really don't know if you can or not
I kind of think that other kids got_to come in here though
in general you know who comes in here sometimes and does work just like you do
who's in your class that was at our house the other day
Roman comes in here too so maybe Roman likes to play with that car too
so that's why you can't really easily take it honey
I don't know
talk to Ryan
well when would you bring it back
the next day
I think that would probably be okay
I guess I see you in class
okay he said alright Boo
okay why don't you grab it and we'll put the rest of the stuff away
get your popcorn okay
let me grab your coat too
here's one okay
okay
they should be in there somewhere
what do you want
let's see here
maybe check on the bottom shelf I think way in the back there
oh_my_goodness there's actually a lot of them
that one's just empty
okay
okay
okay
wait wait I got a question
are you gonna open them all
oh_my_goodness
you got this one okay
wow there's a lot in there isn't there
there's a lot of them
and here's this one wow
is that the last one
okay so which one should we start with
okay
what do you suppose is in there
what do you think
you gotta see
okay
whoa
uhoh
what is that
yeah what is that
oh_my_goodness
interesting oh I just noticed something
I don't know if we can play with these
it says recommended for children over three years of age
how old are you
you can still play with it you think so
so what's that other thing there
what is that a boat
oh okay
a bathtub
so we were talking about before we came in about this parade
what'd you guys do in this parade
you were waving a streamer okay
here's these things
okay
oh yeah what are those
you got all kinds of little things there
this is the one we weren't sure of last time remember
I really don't know what that is
that is so cute
do you think they make bread small enough to fit in that toaster
I don't think so either
that would be some pretty small bread huh
oh now we got another table a couple of tables here
so in the parade did you guys have_to say anything or play instruments
some other people were what
oh so other people were playing instruments
so you were in the parade
that's pretty cool
oh it was at school
now what's this thing here
a pin
who made that
you made that pin
now that is pretty neat
how'd you make it
okay
how will we get this one open
okay and then she made the pin and then you guys do you get to keep it now
that's a pretty neat pin
yeah pin yeah
you know Ryan might not know this that I had to go to a conference and you did a bunch of stuff with daddy when I was gone
I missed Matty when I when I was gone but you guys went to a new zoo
really
now where's the new zoo at
you don't remember the name
it's Erie
oh
what did you guys do at the zoo cause I really don't know cause I wasn't there you know
the other time we forgot this one what's in that one
oh another
another little toaster
so the last time we forgot that one huh
it's not opened yet is it
the toaster's still in its little bag
so you were looking at animals at the zoo
what else did you guys do at the zoo
anything else
Boo did you guys do anything else at the zoo
no
oh
they had blue ones huh
so daddy pulled you in the wagon
that was a good idea
that's pretty neat
what kind of animals did they have there
I haven't been to a zoo in a long time
oh
oh yeah what kind of a loud one
you forget
was it that hyena
didn't you tell me there was a loud hyena there
it wasn't the hyena
we'll have_to see I'm not sure
we said that we might go right once we're all done with school
sure
what's your favorite kind of animals to see when you are at the zoo
oh yeah
dinosaurs
did you say real real dinosaurs
oh_my_goodness
look at what you can do
I did not know that that came apart
did they have any snakes at the zoo
no
how come this one comes out and the other one doesn't
interesting
that is kind of interesting
so another thing you and Daddy did while I was gone was you guys went to a dance
you want to tell about that
did you dance there
what was the dance for
Daddy's work
what did you guys do
what was your job at the dance
oh
to sell candy yep
so we got a little table and what's this thing here
a bed wow
we got all kinds of stuff and this is a very mixed up house though
you know what I can do
I can turn this house around and we can put the stuff in the rooms
it's got some stuff in it but we can put our stuff in it
we can make our own little house huh
do you want me to take this stuff out
and then we can put our stuff in there
okay that's a good idea
okay so that's gonna stay in there huh
hey didn't you and Daddy also go to visit the land while I was gone Matty
what did you guys do on the land
you ate some there
what did you eat
berries
twigs
grass
you did you ate grass there
oh
what did you eat there
I think you guys did had a picnic right
that sounds like fun
I like going on picnics
that is fun
you know I think even since we've seen Ryan we also had a holiday Easter
I don't think we've seen Ryan since Easter
so what'd you get for Easter Mat
Wild Thornberry books
do you remember the name of all of them
oh_my_goodness is it another set of those
that is so funny now we have so many pies look at that
who's gonna eat all these pies
I'm not hungry
we have so many pies we do we have a bunch of pies
that's really funny
we got another toaster too
wow
how many toasters should they put in that house do you think
lots
how many do you have in your house
one
one toaster
I have one in my house too
yeah ours is kind of different though
ours is a toaster oven
so ours doesn't have like where the bread pops out right
sometimes they have it where the bread pops out when it's done
ours doesn't work like that though right
do you like toast do you like to eat toast
another cookbook
well how many cookbooks do we have now
three cookbooks
hey can I see those
I was trying to think of what that was
oh okay
oh okay
yeah they do
they got a lot of cookbooks in this house
it says Crisco
they used to use that instead of butter
so now I haven't been to your house in a long time so I was wondering how is your tortoise was doing
I can go get that
is he doing pretty good
yeah
has he gotten any bigger
you think so
yup
oh this looks like chalk
you think it is
I really don't know what that's supposed to be
a xxx
I know I wonder where that's supposed to go in the house
so I was asking you about Easter cause you got books for Easter
do you remember what's one of the names of one of the books
do you remember
cats
yup
cats have ants bird cries wolf and remember the other one
drawing the line yep you remembered all the names that's good
do you know which one is your favorite one
okay that's fine
I'll try to think of which one I like best
I think I like ah
I like cats have ants
that's pretty weird
really
there's people in there let's see
I think those are things you can buy
more people more people for the house if you don't have any
they have some here right
there might be
oh so you were wondering if there could be some people inside these boxes right
that could be
I don't know
looks like there's plenty of furniture and plenty of toasters
oh and you have another fridge here
should they have two fridges at their house
they must have a lot of food then huh
wow I wonder what kind of food they should have in there
I think they should have
yeah
oh hockey game little thing like we have that
but they don't have any hockey sticks right
where's the hockey sticks
what were you gonna say Ryan
I was gonna say that I would have a lot of Chewies in my refrigerator
Chewies do we put Chewies in the fridge
where do you keep Chewies
oh in the cabinet oh okay
what kind of things do we put in the fridge
anything
like the cat
well
we put our heads in there
what would happen to your head if you put it in the fridge
it would freeze up
is there something stuck in there here let me see if I can get it out
oh it's another box
well how do you think we can get it out
some scissors
how about that I turned it
will that help a little bit
what
what's wrong with that one
it has tape on it
can I try to get it off so you don't end up ripping the box
let me try to take that little tape off okay
this means I guess it's never been open huh
okay guess let's see what'd you guess is in here
a table okay
here I took the tape off so you could check
you think it's a couch
I can't see it
oh yup
so now how many couches are there
in here there's how many
oh_my_goodness
wow
that couch is on the table
you want me to put them in
oh and I get to decorate them decorate the house
okay
another fridge
wow we're gonna have_to build another house
wow that's a lot of fridges
well what room should the should the toilet go in
there's not really a bathroom in this house
where should we have people
in here
it looks like the kids' room
is that a good place for the toilet
probably right in case they have_to go in the middle of the night
and the bathtub in the kids' room too
they can just get washed off quick huh
okay
they can just go over there
alright so we almost have all these things set up
people huh
let's see
wow
people you did find them
let's see here I think when we saw Ryan last time you and Daddy were planning to go somewhere
do you remember where Daddy was going to take you but then we couldn't go
do you remember that where Daddy was gonna take you to go swimming
do you remember where that was
you guys were gonna go to the big water park right
oh
yeah but then they could not go
so what did we do instead
we didn't go to the big water park where did Daddy take you
to what
to a hotel yeah
what did you guys do at the hotel
you swam there too yeah
you like swimming
yeah
do you plug your nose
oh okay
did ya
one time you sunk under the water
well what happened
well that's good
did you get any water in your mouth
nope cause he grabbed you so it worked out huh
so do you have_to where anything when you go swimming like something on your arms or something
no
you do
you'll show me if you get it out
I don't remember a little turtle thing
is it a raft or something around your waste
I don't think I know about this little turtle thing
what are those
books cool
oh my
there's a lot of books
okay
I think though that this might be the last one that we should take apart okay
you wanna take them all out
well it's gonna take like Ryan hours to put them all away
are we gonna help him put them away
yeah
okay
we will though we have_to help him because there's gonna be too many to put away
we don't even know maybe which boxes to put them in so I think we should probably start cleaning up pretty soon okay
a couple more minutes
I don't think there will be time to get all of them out honey
we can save them for next time how about
that's what I was thinking
in fact what we can do is the one's we haven't opened yet we can set them in a special spot so we know that we haven't opened those ones
oh that's a good idea
maybe we can almost hide them then right
yeah we'll have_to hide them
so that Roman doesn't come and open them and stuff
well if we hide them Roman won't find them and he won't open them because you want to be able to open them right
yep
I wonder how many more fridges there are and how many more toasters
are those the ones that are left then
okay so let's see we still have another chance to open them another time okay
this is the last box okay so I'll hide these other two okay so we can open the other ones later
I'll put them back way back far okay
so which one is the last one
okay that's the last one
oh so you gotta put those things in too in where
okay so we'll put those in
I know but look at that
can people use that furniture
all we got it it's just gotta fit right
that would be a funny house to go inside wouldn't it to have all the furniture everywhere
now where is the people gonna sit down
holy smokes
let's see now these are ones that we still have yet to open
because they're kind of behind other things okay
you're gonna decorate right you're gonna decide where you want all the little ones
okay
oh_my_goodness
it's a really really messy room yeah
I wonder who's gonna have_to clean it all up
too many things huh
too many things to clean up
what if we did our own house like this
that's true there really is no space to walk in that room
how might somebody sleep on that bed
pull themselves on huh
they'd have_to hold on to the sides here
I don't know
what do you think
oh okay should I still put them back away
well we'll pick up first and then we can do something else
you know I'm just kind of worried that they all might just crash onto the floor and then they might break
can I grab them
okay should I take them gently
I'm just worried about the ones that are porcelain
like the toilet and the sink thing are made out of porcelain and they could break but I think I got the rest now
well the toilet is in the other one
remember we put it in the kids room
the sink is right here
oh_my_goodness you got a whole other arm full huh
lots_of couches
where should we put the bed do you think
there's nothing in there okay
it's heavy
oh I think I already put the couch in I think that was one I already put away
just now I just did when I grabbed when you gave it to me
hey how's your bedroom doing
didn't you get something new in your bedroom
how is it
is it pretty neat
tell me a little about it
do you have dinosaurs on the wall
not yet
that sounds pretty neat
I say a boy
oh I was right
I thought you were trying to trick me
two
okay I'll close my eyes so I don't see
can I open them
there's three in there
how'd they all fit
let me see
oh you're right
boy they're smooshed right in there aren't they
they're captured yeah
so that actually stays in that room
can I see how you put in the people
can I check
but they're a different set honey
does it fit in that one maybe
I don't know
they might be too big
yeah it's too big
now they're really captured huh
they're safe in there you think
you want to put that away
thank you Matty
oh well we still have a couple things to put away honey okay
there's not too many left
okay I'll leave it open now go ahead look through the house and see what still needs to be put away
a tv
I see something that definitely still has to be put away do you see
one thing that was a couple of things two things
remember we were talking about them
oh I see something too
here's one box for one of them
oh and I think I got the other fridge box
hey thank you
you know I don't know if Ryan knows that you are almost done with school
you are getting so big
