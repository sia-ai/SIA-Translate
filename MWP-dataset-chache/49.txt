okay
you know Mom when I sell those candies I feel like I'm on a mission
I think I should sell candy to everybody
www
but I already have a wife
today
mhm
what about if that I have a wife what would you say
hm
how many would I have
what would you do with two two moms
what would you do with two moms
a what
yeah and the other one
you want the one
mhm
sounds good to me
that's what they do in some families
mom doesn't have_to do any work they just get a maid
and a maid takes care of the kids
oh no
and Mother spends all her time going to parties
that's true
and wouldn't see the kids any more
mother doesn't Mother basically maids raise their kids
mhm
that seems so cruel
because all the hard work that a mother does is try and take care of those little kids
kitty
kitty stop that
it's supposed to get markedly cooler
it's supposed to get markedly cooler
I bet you thought I said supposed to get Mark a pool or something
and
mhm
well what does this have_to do with school
yeah
yeah
hm
you have a basic problem here Ross
you're too much
you are asking for b when you haven't even secured a
you don't yet have our permission to take Transformer to school
what if some kid comes around and rips off one of the arms
then you're gonna be remember the time that um Michael Olah took your calculator
took it home put it under his bed broke it and we had to buy you a new one
remember the time
you lost your hood
but you could lose things too
and then there was some other toy you took once it a piece of it
mm the calculator wasn't loose
no they got loose after Michael Olah slept on it
I see no reason for him to take expensive toys to school
you promised it didn't you Ross
why will they beat you to death
explain it
explain the whole deal
explain who who these kids are that are going to beat you to death
I want to know because we'll report them to the teacher
I'll report on them all
I don't want them to get in trouble
you don't want them you
you don't want to tattle on your friends
okay then I promise I wont
okay I wont report it to the teacher but tell me who they are
I thought Mike and Jerry were the ones who were beating up on you
and they're friends again
Jerry Roman
you mean Jerry Roman
you know that Michael and Jerry are both Romanian
Romanian
oh yes
because one of theirs name is Roman
Michael Jerry Roman
that means he's Romanian
and Michael Olah that means Romanian in Hungarian
did you know they're both Romanian
I'll show you where Romania is sometime
it's right next_to Hungary
he's been to Romania
we went to Romania
remember
when you almost got hit by the truck
boy
are you on that again
well we know where one we know there's one Decepticon that you're going to get for Christmas
so all you've got_to do is wait till Christmas and you can do this whole thing
now wait a minute
wait a second
are you going to take both a Decepticon and an Autobot
one kid taking two one kid taking two fancy complex toys
oh I'm getting out_of this
he hasn't even gotten permission to do the first one and he's campaigning for the second
I don't think this is going to work Ross
okay here's the deal
you've got_to figure out from the other kids what they're going to bring of course because tell them that your parents say that it's not fair for you to bring all the toys
what are the other kids bringing
well what have they got
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
I see
mhm
and
you have what
right
the leader of the bunch right
now
how's this gonna work
uh tell them that it's just you're gonna have_to wait until Marky's birthday party when they come
or else you could have Boys_club a meeting of Boys_club and everybody can bring a transformer
you wanna do that
okay
I'll tell you what
I've got an idea
you're dead meat
okay
if you can get a note from Michael and Jerry if they can write a note saying
can Ross please bring his Autobot
okay
I want them to write notes and I don't want them in your hand+writing
I want it in their hand+writing
can Ross please bring his Autobot
okay
and then they say
Mrs Forno says it's okay
can they write that
says s a y s
it i t
is i s
o k
just write o and k
Mrs Forno says it is okay
so
no no you write it
can or Jerry and Steve have_to write it
can Ross er Spike can Spike do they call you Ross or Spike
can Spike please bring b r i n g his h i s Autobot a u t o b o t
okay transformer what ever
I don't care
okay now
