he couldn't ride a bike so
he got in the race as an obstacle
he was a good one
some men were pitching horseshoes
Clifford wanted to try that too
they made a mistake
luckily I stopped him before it was too late
don't throw the horse Clifford
next we played volleyball
Clifford was keeping his eye on the ball
but he forgot about the net
poor Clifford
volleyball was not his game
we saw some people getting for a pie eating contest
now that looked like something Clifford would enjoy
it was
Clifford was the champion pie eater
afterward Clifford tried to lift the pie crumbs off his fake beard
some birds came to help
the birds liked the beard more than Clifford did
we left it behind and went off to get ready for the big parade
there were bands and floats lining up in front of the school
one float was being decorated with all kinds of flowers
someone forgot that bees love flowers
Clifford tried to shoo the bees away but that didn't work
so he took a deep breath and blew those bees out of town
can you do that
the mayor did something special to thank Clifford for chasing the bees away
good job
he made Clifford the leader of the parade
he gets to wear that hat and it says grand marshal
at last everything was ready
we were going to march down Main Street and cross the town bridge
suddenly a man ran up and stopped the parade
there was trouble ahead at the bridge
Clifford and I rushed off as fast as we could go
oh xxx the bridge had collapsed
Clifford did some quick thinking
can you guess what happened then
the big parade went on as planned but Clifford wasn't in it
he was
under it
good old Clifford saved the day
it was the best birthday party ever
