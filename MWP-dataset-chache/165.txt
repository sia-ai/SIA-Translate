and now the cat is getting away again going into that
yeah
you've gotta be careful when you're chasing a cat
and the cat's in a big pipe and they're going after him
but what's he doing

and the policeman is helping her up right
xxx and here comes the cat xxx what do you think of this book so far

and he's scratching the policeman
that could be
that could be the little girl's brother
and there goes the cat up a tree and the policeman
and he's trying to climb the tree and catch the cat
