Harold and the purple crayon
one evening
after thinking it over for some time
Harold decided to go for a walk in the
moonlight
there wasn't any moon
and Harold
needed a moon oh
needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
and he needed something to walk on
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
there it is
xxx but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path
so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
and the moon went with him
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought_to be
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with
just one tree in it
that's right
it turned out to be an
yep
the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red
so he put a
yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
it was a terrible frightening dragon
it even frightened Harold he backed away
his hand holding the purple crayon
shook
yep
suddenly he realized
that's right your hands are shaking xxx
that's right he's falling right into the water
by then Harold was over his head
in an ocean hm
mhm
just like you were in the ocean the other day
he came up thinking xxx fast
and
xxx thinking fast and thinking big heh
he's thinking a lot yep
he has to think a lot because he has a lot of adventures so he has to
he has to
protect himself
and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a
a trim little boat
he quickly set sail
and the moon sailed along with him
mhm
and what did he draw
mhm
the sailboat
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble
he stepped ashore on the beach
mhm
wondering where he was
where was he
right
the sandy beach reminded Harold of
yep picnics
and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch
yep lots_of pies
there was nothing but pie
but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left
mhm and a
yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left
a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
mhm a moose and a porcupine they're gonna finish up all the pie
Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
so he decided to make the hill into a
yep mountain
if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom
he was tired and he felt he ought_to be getting to bed
he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain
but what happened
as he looked down over the other side he
yep he slipped
and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in
thin air but luckily
right he kept his wits and his purple crayon
he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it
and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
no I can see your window right over there right over there too
you have two windows in your bedroom
and usually the moon is
we can see the moon out that window
at night
he couldn't even see a house
so he made a house
with windows
two houses yup
and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front xxx
looks like your house
none of the windows was his window
he tried to think where his window ought_to be
he made some more windows
he made a big building full of windows
he made lots_of buildings full of windows
he made a whole city full of windows
it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there
but none of the windows was his window
he couldn't think where it might be
yep
that's right
he decided to ask a policeman
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway
but Harold thanked him
he followed the way
as he walked a
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed
you gonna walk straight to your bed
then suddenly Harold remembered
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
going to your bed
just like Harold did xxx
the purple and brown book that's what color it is
mixed up
like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue
and a little bit green
now this book is a lot brown and some purple
a different color purple
that's a color purple and that's a different color purple
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon
