it's supposed to be honey
pouring out of the pot
everybody leaned over to see
uhoh train's off the track
for some reason this isn't easy to do
maybe it's a volcano of honey
see it's very hard to do isn't it
mkay
you wanna make Pooh
so Pooh can gobble all this honey up
should I make Pooh
we definitely need the yellow for that huh
yep we haven't used the yellow
you wanna open it up yourself
use all your strength

here's the Pooh cookie cutter
whoop
gotta push a little harder so we can make a really good Pooh
you put it down and I'll press

now take all the extra off before you pull it up
take all the extra up
all this around here yeah
xxx need to take the extra off
there's some more extra
there ya go
do you want me to get him out
that's the hard job
that's the hard job
I think we've got a pretty good Pooh there
his face is not quite right
maybe we didn't mush it in enough
maybe we need to use a rolling+pin
the rolling+pins are over there
in the box
xxx see them over there
now I think you need to roll it on top
to push all the Play_Doh in
no on top of here
so make sure all the Play_Doh gets smushed down yeah
roll roll
yep that's the best one
that's the best one for this job
of course if you wanna make waffles
xxx did you find the waffle one
xxx falafel xxx
that was something else we ate
you used to like falafel
we should get you some more falafel xxx
falafel falafel
don't feel awful about your falafel
okay Ethan you think this one might be better
because we used the rolling+pin
mkay let's see

xxx we call that one the waffle one
there
that's one's better
now he has a face
why don't you make Pooh a waffle

Dayja stop it
should we let Dayja in
maybe Dayja's lonely
and wants to be where somebody loves him best of all
come on in silly
just don't eat the Play_Doh
sit
no Dayja
come on
sit
sit right there
sit
good dog
xxx okay sit down
Dayja gets lonely very easily
you're gonna make a busy buzzy bee good idea
you can sit down Dayja
xxx you made a busy buzzing bee
and Pooh would say if there's a bee around I know there must be some honey
if there's a bee around I know there must be honey
so I'm going to follow that busy buzzing bee
it flew right next to Pooh's ear that's right
should we make some honey for Pooh
this is supposed to be a honey pot
I'm gonna push down really hard
there we go
come on Pooh there's some honey for you
yeah I let Dayja in because Dayja was crying
Dayja wanted company
Dayja didn't want to be alone
I looked in but the honey pot was empty
poor Pooh
I bet it's going to rain today Ethan
poor Pooh he's gonna have_to climb a honey tree or something huh
xxx gonna ask the bee where the honey is
and what did the bee say
and the bee replied
buzz
should we make a tree out of Play_Doh
we don't have the right colors for a tree but we can make a green tree
with a yellow top
you wanna make a green tree
tree+trunk
and then we'll have some yellow leaves on top
you want a hole for the owl
we need a tool to make the hole in the tree
maybe the knife will do
xxx we need an owl to go inside this little hole in the tree huh
instead of a brown bottom and a green top we need a special magical tree
but it won't stay up
there's the hole though
maybe it's where the bees live
and Pooh can reach in there and get some honey
yeah
maybe you could use the knife again
put it down on the mat
yeah
yeah that's a good idea sweetie
do you want me to help you cut it away
good job
the extra is going away now
it's getting smaller so it's almost at the bee isn't it
and so it's almost just a bumble+bee now
is that good or you want it smaller even
let's do this
it's good to take the extra off before
now you have a little bumble+bee
is the hole still there
let's make the hole bigger
there's one big hole
that's where bees live and make their honey sometimes Ethan

he's gone out to play with his friends said Mrs Funny Bunny
Honey Bunny sat down by the window
she did not want to paint
she did not want to play dolls
she did not even want to play with her friends
