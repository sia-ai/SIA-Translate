and then this gets clipped just like Mommy's
should we read Harold's Trip to the Sky
okay
one night Harold got up made sure there was a moon so he wouldn't see things in the dark
and went to get a drink of water
he wondered about the things people see in the dark and where they came from
he was glad he couldn't see them in the moonlight
suddenly he realized he didn't see anything at all in the moonlight there was nothing to see
he was in the middle of a desert
no wonder he was so thirsty
but luckily he had brought his purple crayon and he knew where to find water on the desert
there was always a pool of it somewhere near a palm tree
Harold drank deeply
there's nothing like drinking nice cool water on a desert
but there isn't much else to do on a desert
Harold realized as he looked around except maybe play in the sand
then he remembered how the xxx
then he remembered how the government has fun on the desert
it shoots off rockets
nineteen fifty six book
Harold decided to go to the moon
on a good fast rocket he figured he could get there and back in time for breakfast
he fired the rocket and off he went
xxx but the rocket missed the moon
it missed it by a mile
and Harold went up and up
up and
there's the moon
but he was going up up up in the dark
where's he gonna land
he tried to see where he was going by looking at the stars
he tried planets and comets what he really needed to light his way was another moon
when Harold looked closely what he saw wasn't a moon it was a flying saucer
Harold had heard about flying saucers people saw them in the dark
and nobody knew who was inside flying them
he decided he'd better land his rocket right away
and landed it with a bump on the bottom of a strange planet
there was no danger falling off so big a planet
however Harold thought he would feel a little bit more comfortable at the top of the planet
he wondered what planet he was on
in the dark light of the stars he looked for some sign that might tell him
xxx what planet is he on
is he on Jupiter
he's on Mars
Harold had heard of men on Mars so he yelled a couple of hellos hopefully
he thought of the flying saucer out there and thought of the things that people see in the dark
he felt a great need for some company
he was sure any man on Mars would be cordial to a visitor like Harold who had come all this way to chat with him
he had to draw on his scanty knowledge of what a man on Mars looked like
but his looks wouldn't really matter in the dark so Harold didn't care much what he turned out to look like
all Harold wanted to know was there was some sort of friendly face close by
then all of a sudden Harold did see it clearly
it was the face of a thing
it was a thing people see in the dark and it was sitting on a flying saucer
and Harold ran away
and he thought and stopped
probably the thing was about to fly to Earth and scare somebody maybe a little child
so bravely Harold crept back
he approached on tiptoe so the thing wouldn't hear him
and he reached out with his purple crayon
and he put a completely damaging crack in the flying saucer
before the thing could grab him he was off again chuckling triumphantly
and ran as fast as he could in the dark
happily most of the way was downhill
he hoped he wouldn't fall head over heels
he arrived safely heels over head at the bottom of Mars where the rocket was
but by this time Harold had had enough of adventure he wanted to get home in a dependable way
so he climbed down on the stars
it was sure but it was slow
and the points of the stars hurt Harold's feet
Harold wished he were home
and he recalled the best way to wish on a
is on a good big shooting star
instead of wishing it occurred to him at the last moment to jump aboard
he shot right down to
what planet does Harold live on
well he was visiting Mars but what planet do we live on
Earth right
he shot right down to Earth where he made a neat two point landing
he hadn't passed the moon on the way and he wondered what happened to it it wasn't anywhere around
then he realized the night was just about gone and it was time for the sun to come up
he was very hungry
the sun appeared right on time
it came up big and bright
and Harold remarked it was going to be a very nice day
nobody was even bothered by flying saucers and things in the sunshine
but for a startled moment he thought he saw a flying saucer
it was on the horizon looking as if it had just come in to land
he was mistaken though it wasn't a saucer it was an oatmeal bowl
xxx Harold happened to like hot breakfasts and he quickly drew up a chair
and sat down to
eat
yummy he's going to eat his breakfast
xxx what did you have for breakfast
you had meat
I don't think so I think you had a granola bar right
and some blueberries
some crackers
uhuh actually means no Honey
as opposed to
yes

yes
hooray
yes
yes

oh you said yes
