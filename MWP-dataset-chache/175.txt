what about the other one
will it come off too
hey
you got it
oop
yeah
that one xxx I think
what a mechanic
you got the bumper off
that's the rear bumper
is there anything else we can take off
this thing
try in
you probably just have_to turn the red part and not the yellow part
the hub and not the steering+wheel
that's it
just turn the hub
xxx you got it
there's the steering+wheel
we're taking this whole car apart
ha
hey look
you're gonna take off the tire too
that's tight
let's see if I can get it started for you
ugh
you're taking off our tire
oh
is it flat
oh
I see
what are you going to do
I see
but you took off our bumper too
why'd you do that
tighten it up
oh
that's good
I wouldn't want to have any trouble with our bumper
hardly anything worse than bumper trouble
you really got that wheel off
hey
are you a mechanic
you're not
what are you
a carpenter huh
carpenters works with tools
carpenters usually work on wood with their tools
you're working on our car
you must be a mechanic
I think you've got that wheel about off too
yes
and you're doing very well with it too
what coordination
super
hooray
you got our wheel off
oh no
you're not gonna take off the other one too
oh dear
our car will never roll again
your daddy will
this could be this could be a problem
you take everything in the world apart
and you get your daddy to put it all back together again
this could definitely be a problem
because you can take things apart just about faster than your daddy can put them your daddy can put them back together again
it's a good thing you know how to put things back together too
you do
how do you do that
what do you poke it with
hmm
well that would do it alright
mhm
mhm
mhm
almost do
that'll be your second wheel
how many wheels does this car have anyway
four or five
count em and see
oh you're fooling me
how many does it really have
how about this one
oh
you're fooling me
you always skip that just to fool me
you can probably turn it the rest of the way with your fingers
when it gets loose you don't need the screw+driver anymore
hmm
it does look like it's jammed doesn't it
oh
it was right on the edge of coming off
you did it
yay
you sure did
I'm worried about my car
pretty soon my car won't have any wheels
hmm
could you turn the car around so we can see you
mm
we can watch from here
mm
what love
sing about it
sing about it
oh
okay
once there was a little old girl gave the nuts a little old twirl
um she knocked off all my tires she generated a great deal of ire in me
cause I was worried
I was worried worried about my wheels yes sire
I was worried worried worried about my wheels
ta ta cha
listen
you're working on my fourth tire now
how will this car ever go anywhere again
you can't rely on your daddy all the time to fix the tires you know
he may have_to go out and have lunch
and then where will I be
I hope you can help me put them back
you did it
you took off all my tires
you know what this is
it's a screw
what's this
right
now you're gonna fix em ay
you know if you put the car back together again I'll take you for a drive to the store
let's do it
let's put it back together
mm
which one are you looking for
the orange one
oh
I think that was the wrench
it's in the back there
there it is
if that's the one you meant
you're not ready to have that back yet huh
sorry
what will that wrench fit on anyway
where does it fit
ya gonna tighten up something
oh yeah that was the one that was loose
now that's much better
you took them off when you took this bumper
when you took off that bumper
now that you fixed it it's a good time to put it back
you need these blue screws and the bumper here
I'll hold it
you're a very neat worker the way you collect all your parts
oh
I didn't see that
that's what the wrench fits on
that's the spare tire
and these ah these probably fit on here
gee
we could play with this for hours
it's too bad we don't have more time with this toy
we could do a lot
see if that nut fits on that
this is a nut
and it fits on this bolt
hmm
I told you this was a screw before but it's really a bolt
a screw has a point
and this is flat on the end
uhhuh
mm
yes
they have a_lot_of spare nuts in the back
this is nice
what could we do with these spare nuts
oh
this is what
oh listen
when this bolt
this is the bolt that held the wheel on
and it went into this nut
that's what held it
so you can change the nuts on this car
you can take that nut in and put this nut in
ya can interchange the nuts
it's a nutty car
uhhuh
you're doing fine
oh
I think it's out honey
you just need to pull it
now let's put that tire on one of the wheels now that we've taken the new tire
which one would you like to put it on
which place
there
okay
alright xxx
while you're doing that is it okay of I put one on this back wheel here
okay
that's a good girl
xxx all that turning for naught
how's yours going
look under the hood
oo it's got an engine
look at that
and more nuts
these nuts hold on the front bumper
and those
two in the back must hold on the back bumper
how's it going
fine
you can probably turn it with your fingers till the very end
then you'll need the screw+driver
it's good exercise using the s screwdriver though
hi
don't feel that you have_to put that together again
we can do that later if you don't to
right
okay
cause it's getting
we're sort of running out_of time
alrightie
okay
see ya
righto
good for you
nice going lovie
tsk
well should we drive over to the store
you put the people in
and I'll whip back on the wheels so we can make the trip
mhm
oh
you're right
we do
which nut do you want to use for the steering+wheel
the red on or the blue one
see which one fits
try it out and see
mhm
will it fit if you
hey
xxx put it in there and see what happens
this big one doesn't fit through here
mhm
it doesn't
huh
it doesn't huh
try this one
plop
tsk
maybe you could use a screwdriver for that one
would you like to drive it over to the store or shall I
okay
you can run the store then
and I'll drive it over
which
oh
well that's because this blue one didn't get on yet
now you go over and run the store
