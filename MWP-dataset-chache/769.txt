I'll make a cinnamon roll out_of the dough that's left okay
do you know what we have_to put in it to make a cinnamon roll
what
how about cinnamon and brown sugar
how does that sound
some butter
just a second
it's a towel to cover up the other rolls so_that they can rise in peace and comfort
they have_to rise first and then they can bake
okay here you go
uhhuh
it's not really melting
it's absorbing the butter
it just looks like it's melting
so we can make a cinnamon roll
you think so
what can we bake it in
how about this
in a little pan
because it's a little cinnamon roll
look out Abe
I have_to cut it
we have_to let it rise and then bake it okay
can I have a piece of it when it's done Abe
thank_you
I'm going to eat it all
I won't
I'm just teasing
okay as_soon_as it's done baking
Abe do I ever eat everything
I beg your pardon but I have_to disagree

do you like the book the mailman brought you today
you said hi to the mailman but he didn't say hi to you
maybe he didn't hear you
sometimes mailmen are real busy
and they don't hear people
because they're in a hurry
and they don't pay attention
because they have_to read postcards
and it's hard to read when people are talking to you
go ahead
I already read it once
I'll read it again when we go to bed
you can stay up a little while longer
