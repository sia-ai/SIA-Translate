that's right
alright bud
you can have breakfast
I've been asking you what you want
what would you like would would you like me to make you some hot cereal

milk
voila
that's your vanilla milk yes it is
here's the deal the reason why I usually give you the other bowl
William I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I think I'm gonna give you a different bowl for this
okay
because this one's very light
and it'll make it a little bit more difficult for you to eat
out of
it doesn't really hold your food when you when you scoop it out
this one is a better bowl for you
because when you scoop it out
it'll stay
because it's heavier
you see
okay

we're not gonna play with that we aren't gonna put it on our head
you like those
