okay
I think it's over in this box here
okay
be glad to
maybe you can slide it
see if it'll see if it'll slide
push
that's it
that's like the camera we have at home
this is a story called
The_great_cat_chase
oh
it's a Mercer Mayer book
she's the one who wrote the story you have about the the uh monsters
you remember
with the uh with the Gololopus
and the uh letter eating the letter eating
I can't remember what it was
it was a letter eating something
remember that one
well there is a lady taking her dog for a walk
oh
excuse me
yes
her cat
she's taking her cat for a walk in a little carriage there
tsk
and uh she looks uh kinda bundled up doesn't she that pussy cat
are you comfortable
she stops to uh pick up her roller skates
actually she's picking a flower
and look what the cat does
the cat jumps out_of the carriage
and she runs around and hides behind this tree
and the lady is very very upset
oh dear she says
oh dear
where is that cat
she's so excited she throws her arms up in the air
and the flower goes a scooting off through the air
she's feeling very upset
because her pussy cat
she's probably
maybe she calls it a baby just like you do
her her her baby her pussy cat is gone
she doesn't know where she is
I think that she's a little girl just like you and that she is taking pretending she's taking her baby for a walk
and she's using her pussy cat for the baby
tsk
so then she runs down the street and there's a little guy dressed up as a policeman
and she says
oh
oh
oh
my baby's gone
I don't know what's happened
maybe somebody kidnapped him
he's gone from the carriage
the policeman's there holding up traffic
clothes don't fit do they
do they
I think he's probably her little brother or somebody else in the neighborhood pretending to be a policeman
and what's the policeman do
mm
yeah
what do you think he's saying to the lady
what do you think he says to her
he says
oh
oh
there there she is
there's your baby
there's your pussy cat
and the lady says
oh
I'm sorry
oh
then you know what happens
the policeman goes down on his knees
and he says
here kitty kitty kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty
and he's trying to get the kitty to come over
and what happens
what happens to em
splat
he's reaching for the kitty and he tries to go and grab her and bunk
he falls over
look at her face
how does she look
pardon
she looks I think she looks kinda angry
she's saying
look what you did
you scared away my pussy cat
you go get him
tsk
so there they are following after the pussy cat
look at that look on the pussy cat's face
how does he feel
I think he's saying to himself
I'm going to outfox them
I'm going to outpussy them
they're not gonna get me
and he's going he's going in that pipe to hide
he thinks it's a good place
I reckon
maybe he thinks they can't follow him in there
tsk
why
perhaps perhaps he he thinks the pipe is too small for them to get in
you think they'll be able to follow him in there
you do
well we'll see
oh there they are trying to crawl in after the pussycat
and look what's happened on the other side
the pussycat has come out and is sitting on top of the pipe
looking back in to see if they're gonna follow him through
out he comes
and there's the pussycat up there
look at that expression on the pussy's face
how do you think the pussy feels
what would the pussy be saying there
I'll bet she'd be saying
ah
they followed me out those people
I'll get away from them
and zoom
up the hill he runs
and the little girl says
oh
there he goes
there he goes
up the hill
up the hill
up the hill
quick
quick
after him
get up there you policeman
go after that guy
ugh he says
he's ling down there in the mud after crawling through
and he still hasn't gotten the pussycat
so she helps him up being a nice person
tsk
she gives him a little help onto his feet
and the pussycat's up there
oh
are you gonna get me
and kajump
she falls down on top of him
the pussycat thinks that's rather funny and comes galomping down the hill
galomp
galomp
galomp
oh dear
they fell into the puddle
tsk
well I bet they they didn't do it on purpose
I can tell you that
it was an accident
they're gonna be all wet now
and the pussycat takes advantage of that moment to go back in the pipe
and phoom
to start running through
there he goes she says
do ya think they're ever gonna catch that pussycat
in she goes
eck
yuck says he
all wet
well he's wet because he fell in the puddle
so they go climbing through again
and when they get to the other side what do you suppose they discover
the little fella who's been following are following them around since the very beginning of the story he has caught the pussycat as the pussy was coming out the other end of the pipe
remember way back here in the beginning
where he was just watching
he was just watching there on his trike
and he was joining with them saying
oh
when they were trying to catch the pussycat
and when they
here he is just watching
aw shucks he says
this isn't interesting
he's walking away
and he
but he does follow them
mm dadadadadada
hands in his pockets
and he sits on top of the pipe and watches all this action when they climb through and come out the other side and fall down and get wet
and he's waiting back there so_that when the pussy comes out he catches him
grab
he's got him
boy oh boy
look at that
think she'll catch him
well look who winded up in the carriage
how about that
heh heh
look
they're all tired and beat up
the pussycat's walking
tsk
oh
she's changed her clothes
who is she now
I think she's a nurse
I think she changed into a nurse's clothes
the end
you like that story
let's look around and see what else we can find to play with
what do you see
tsk
yes
it's a
jeepers
I don't know what the heck kind of flower that is
it's not a uh
I thought it was a tulip when I first saw it but it's sure not a tulip
there's something in here too
mm
okay
take the other stuff out too an see what you can do with it
would you drive it over here lovie so I can see it too
uhhuh
what are they
other parts of the equipment huh
mhm
okay
was that your brakes
I think this is the jack for when they get stuck
they have_to change the tire
they have_to jack it up
uhhuh
hmm
that's the jack
we have_to get that under the axle
ah
this is the ax
oo
everybody can't can't see the axles
how about that
can't see the axles on this car
the axle is the bar that holds the that the wheels spin on
but it does have a screw+driver
and I'll bet the screw+driver would turn these things
see if it does
turn it
oh
it turns
turn it the other way
got it real tight that time
maybe you can get the whole thing apart
that's it
yes
it goes around that way
yeah
watch me turn it a few times
this way and this way
this way
and you keep turning it
and I'll bet that'll come right off that bumper
ha
