I think it was big and orange
big orange something
don't remember
I think it was a pumpkin
did she turn a pumpkin into the coach
I think she turned the pumpkin into coach
eat the pumpkin
it was gonna be the coach though
if they eat the pumpkin they can't go to the ball right
no
so I hope no one eats the pumpkin
because that would be too bad
of course it does make good pumpkin pie
that's true
does Cinderella like pumpkin pie
whoops let me get that back on
this ah little Cinderella does
this little Cinderella likes pumpkin pie
really
let's see
well what else happens
well what happens after she gets to the ball

what do I do
what does the stepmother tell me to do
clean
okay
gonna clean the floors
then what happens
what happens
you don't know
you wanna be Cinderella
sure
okay
and what do I say to Cinderella
I say
gotta clean floors
it's really dirty in here and I won't let you go to the ball until you finish
and then what happens
excellent job
it's all clean
well I guess we'll let you go to the ball if you have time with all the other chores
okay
what happened
what happens to her next
do you remember
oh okay
so she's cleaning the floors again
you okay
it hurts your butt
let me see if I can get that up there
there you go
so then
the stepmother comes in and says Cinderella did you finish cleaning the floors
you did
well I don't think I want you to go to the ball anyways
sorry
and then what happens to Cinderella
what does she do
she gets a dress but first what happens
oh she found a dress
did the fairy godmother give her a dress
no
oh she does okay
a pink dress
can I what
what happens next
you want me to be the stepsisters
okay
you're gonna have_to help me because I don't remember what happens
what happens
what do the stepsisters do
you can't help
I don't remember what the stepsisters do
what do the stepsisters do when xxx
oh they rip up her dress
is that what happens
we want our dress back
I'll rip off her dress
there
and then what happens to Cinderella
she runs away and what
what does she do
she cries right
but then who comes to help her
right
right
yep
and Cinderella what are you crying about
so what are you going to tell Cathy about today
you ate them even though you don't like them
oh okay
well that's good because peaches are good for you
you like them sometimes
well that's good
oh really
you think dinosaurs like peaches
hm
really
where do you put them when you take them away
I hide them in my plate
you do
oh_my_goodness
what does Aladar do
you don't know
oh_my_goodness
and this all happens at school
wow
that's a great story
I like that
no he didn't
because there's some water there
maybe this dinosaur will take a bath though
he slipped on a tree
oh no
oh dear
oh really
oh wow
oh_my_goodness
so he crunched up all the leaves
oh for him to sleep on
to make a little bed
that's a good idea
oh and a blanket too
really
wow
so he goes to sleep
oh that's the little Allosaurus
the little baby dinosaur
what else do we have here
there's lots_of little dinosaurs
I don't know what that dinosaur is
he's got funny stuff on his back doesn't he
there's a flying dinosaur
oh it is
it's a flying dinosaur
a flying nightmare
really
oh
well that's not nice
I hope the dinosaurs don't get too scared
what do the dinosaurs do when they see the the flying dinosaur
they get really scared
oh
then what happened
he did
he scared you away
uhoh
oh no
oh
phew that's a relief
that's a good story
but you were doing a wonderful job
you did
that was a great story
yeah
are you kidding
that was the best story I've heard in a long time
but you just made it up didn't you
didn't you make that one up
well why don't you use a different dinosaur to tell a story
a new one because there's a lot of dinosaurs over there
yeah
and I bet every one of those can tell a story
that's a good idea
which dinosaur should we make a story of
well let's pick out a dinosaur and see if we can make up a story about it
we move them away
oh wow
they're all going away on a trip
all of them
wow
are they taking a bus
to school
oh
there they go
now who's left
Aladar is left
what's he gonna do
he's all by himself
I don't know
why is he alone
why did all the other dinosaurs go away and he stayed
I don't know
can you tell me
you don't know
there must be a reason they all went away
did all the other dinosaurs forget him
and leave without him
oh okay
there he goes
all the trees go too
all right there they go
he sits on the eggs
he's sad
are they his eggs
so he's gonna be a daddy soon
when they hatch
yeah
oh
what's inside the eggs then
really
wow
oh
oh really
that's his name
okay
hello Jillysaurus
