for crashing rocks
uh huh
now what did you do when you went to the fire station
would you like to be a fireman when you grow up

what do you want to be when you grow up
what would you like to be when you grow up
okay
you don't have_to decide
okay
I love you
and you've been a good boy you know that
you're not ready to decide what you're going to be
you don't have_to decide now
if somebody says what you want to be when you grow up say
I'll decide that when I get older
it's too early for me to decide
I'm too little to decide
now do you want to know where you're going next
okay next week you're going to the zoo
and then after that you go to the aviary where the birds are and then the last field trip is to McDonald's
yeah
you've got three more field trips

you've been to the zoo right
it says here on the list where you get to go
now you've been to the aviary
did you get to see the birds Mark

next week on Thursday
you go swimming on Wednesday and Marky goes goes swimming on Thursday
that's right
I pushed the button
I pushed the button on the door
where I won't won't touch it
so Rossy won't touch it
so Rossy won't touch it
so Rossy won't touch it right Daddy
right
you guys want to ride your bikes
he won't get blocks
you can go get books
not books blocks
www
well what do you think it should be like
okay so what's the whole question
too hard a question isn't it
um I don't know
uh huh
why
yeah
I don't know
yes
you must know
you know all the things that you need to know
I don't know
oh
I don't know why
oh I see
well that is silly isn't it
I don't know
because it was a Dutch computer
oh I see
who's your best boy friend
oh he's really fun isn't he
really
oh melanin
how do you know that
what do you mean
what are you talking about
is that a game you play play at school
where did you get that
is that where you found out about Melanin
what do you want to show me little boy
well tell me about it
I'm going to give you lick back or a back lick
which one do you like better
yeah you can
is that a made up word
how about kisser
what about running
what about kissing
Marky Marky what's Daddy doing
giving me some
right
dadadadadada nobody sing this song
well the answer is I don't have anything for this afternoon
Ross
is that too bad
is that good or bad
bad
what do you want
what kind of presents do you want
yeah but we wouldn't buy anything right
and then what Ross if the sensor scope is missing
and we won't buy any toys
well what if there is a sensor scope
does that mean we're supposed to buy it
what do you mean you don't know
what do you mean you don't know
you forgot the whole argument
no he didn't
he didn't
he knows very well
he knows that I've said that I'm not going to buy anything
he knows very well that there's a possibility that if it were there that maybe we would buy it
he also knows that if he says that
that he wouldn't get it
that he'd be in less of a position to say so
right
so he's saying
well maybe we could just go and take a look
once we get there then we can figure out how to get them to really buy it right
is that the idea Ross
how are you going to get R_two_D_two
he's being very noncommittal
how are you going to get your parents to get you R_two_D_two
say nothing and hope
and what else do you do
what
work hard with your other new toys
show that you're a good boy
Ross
poor dear
and maybe you'll get something nice
oh I know another way you can get your R_two_D_two
take your money out_of your piggy bank
would you like to do that
maybe it's time to take your money out_of your piggy bank
and then you don't have_to be nice
you can take your own little money
you don't have_to be nice
isn't that great
do you like it better when you're not nice or when you are nice
when he doesn't have_to be nice
it's better when he doesn't have_to be nice
you put that in his mouth
he is nice so he doesn't have_to be nice
okay Ross would you like to eat some breakfast
no we can't
how are we going to buy it
oh wait
now wait a second
if it doesn't cost a_lot_of money there'll be no problem in buying it
what do you mean even if it doesn't cost a_lot_of money we can still buy it
you mean that if it does cost a_lot_of money then we can't buy it
if it costs a_lot_of money then we can't buy it
what did you mean
tell me the whole idea again
that's what he meant if it isn't too much money then we can buy it
but he said even if it doesn't
so he's got even if wrong
he means if it doesn't cost a_lot_of money then we can buy it
what about even if it does cost a_lot_of money
then will we buy it
not if it costs too much money no
and even if he doesn't finish his breakfast
in other words we still have a_lot_of action figures to buy
what do you mean Ross
go ahead tell me
for new ones
which ones don't we have
what else
power Droid
we're missing cloud city pilot or something like that
no we've got that
At_At pilot
we have an At_at driver
there's another At_At
At_At pilot
there's a something pilot we're we're missing
cloud something pilot
there some kind of other Imperial we're missing too
why did your back begin to hurt Ross

why are you so violent
is it because you're watching so many violent violent tv programs
no I don't
just the news
that's all I watch
does the plug go up or down or sideways
does it go this way
sideways or does it go up and down
sideways
it moves over sideways
and then how does the water go sideways or up and down
okay well you know what
you're almost right
but there's a lever that goes like this
it goes goes sideways and it pulls the plug up Ross
it doesn't pull it sideways
it pulls it straight up and it opens up a hole and the water goes out the hole
you almost had it right
do you want me to show you what it looks like like again
okay
yeah
you mean the picture
you mean the big picture of Snow White on the calendar
no we're finished with the old month now
now we have a new month
the old month is finished
it's all broken up
and now we have a nice new one
I'll love you if I don't
I won't love you if I do
what would happen if you had a fork with no handles
you'd get all sticky when you pick up the watermelon right
no I'm not going to do it because sometimes you guys don't tell the truth
how do I know you're telling the truth
don't spill
anybody caught spilling this morning goes into the torture chamber
yeah we do need those

give me your last kiss
you know why I say you can use it
because
what's the word
what do you do to your teeth
with what
okay and what is it called
sewing

we forgot to sew our teeth out
did you tell him
ya one of those incidental thoughts
ya here's a story
nobody made God
nobody made God he was the first guy in line
do some reading
no
I'm not up to it
in other words if he wasn't up for baseball would I be up for baseball
right
it's a good idea if you want to get your Dad to do something
think about
what
no
no because the money won't cheat me
no
what do you think Ross
do you think I should worry about it
why
that's xxx though
okay
okay okay but just go on talking about the money machine
why do you think I should worry about it
why xxx Give me a good reason to worry
well maybe there's no reason to worry
I'll write the names now I'll write the names on the very bottom
I have to go pee pee
don't say that
don't say what Dad's saying
don't say what you're saying
what
you know what you have
you have a good mind too
and so does my father
Ross said
oh I do
what do you want to buy there
why
what
well he got the materialized
yes but he got his job back Brian
that's true
did you notice that little tiny part at the end of the movie
no
where he got his job back as a computer programmer
no I didn't
and Ross noticed
after all that flash bang that he should have noticed
well it had a happy ending
no
how do I know it's good
good thinking Ross
you'd better stop crying too
Ross would you stop eating lettuce
no
hey Ross what's the end of that story
what did he do now
read the story
and now
the story of God right
how many boys are going to go sit at the table and eat breakfast
we are
oh so if you're barefoot or with shoes on you can only go when but with socks no
if you're barefoot or if you have shoes on you can go in there
but if you socks on you cant go in there
ya that's what he's saying
he has it in other words
mm hum that's right
you've got the right idea
earlier Mommy was saying how boys want any breakfast and Mommy raised her hand too
I can't fix them
uhuh
it was a very nice thing for him to say
later
just thank_you
there's just a little bit left and you can have it when you finish what you have on your plate
so what you're saying is that we shouldn't eat that now right
why shouldn't we eat it now Ross
it's a collision
okay

and we wouldn't have any later when we really wanted it right
I think you're right
