yeah
the embassy of nature was founded by xxx individuals feeling an urgent need to participate actively in the defense of the rivers forests lakes and jungles that we love
the organization is compromised
comprised
of a circle of friends from around the planet
it is our belief that the present greed and ignorance
motivated destruction of earth's ecological life support system is placing all humans in peril of extinction
we must act now
the end
and there's the guy who wrote the book
and here's professor Mario
Dari Riviera
Janson and Dari worked together in the early development of Guatemala's first system of wildlife reserves called Biotopos
yep
it's a good book
yep but now we gotta go and uh
get dressed and everything
let's make sure
yep
I think it's all set
come on xxx we'll go brush our teeth

let's well we gotta make a movie
let's sit over here what do you wanna look at one of the books
which one
this one
alright come up here
come on up
what do you wanna look at
tigers
ooh let's count the babies
yeah
yeah
remember when your mother told you to stop playing with your food
that's the opposite of what goes on at the Minnesota zoo where zoo+keeper Ross Taylor encourages tigers to play with their food
Taylor often tosses tiger popsicles three pound meaty horse bones frozen inside heavy chunks of ice into the moat surrounding the tiger enclosure where two year old Maya and her siblings live
as soon as they hear a splash the tigers jump in
each cat grabs a popsicle while the others drag their treats to shore
Maya carries hers into deeper water
she has figured out that ice melts faster in the moat's water than it does in the air
her siblings have_to wait a couple of hours to enjoy their bone treats but Maya is gnawing on hers after only twenty minutes
this is one tiger that prefers fast food
this feeding technique encourages the big cats to swim something tigers enjoy in the wild
it also provides them with exercise and keeps helps keep them from becoming bored
gimme a kiss please
we're gonna go can I give you a kiss Violet
I'll read this to you later okay
be good and have fun
love you have a nice day
xxx the wet kisses last longer than the dry kisses

we're off to work
you're wearing your bug pin xxx Honey xxx I wouldn't bring that in case something happens to it

because remember the necklace
let's keep it home
but that that necklace xxx
I know but it still could something happen to it and then you'll get upset Honey
that could be delicate even old stuff can be delicate
modern zoos recognize that to stay healthy captive animals need exercise play interaction with other animals and interesting ways to eat
toy tool
Loki the crow a research animal that lives behind the scenes at the zoo entertained himself by trying to take apart everything in his aviary
to keep him busy and distract him from expensive stuff like microphones researcher Patricia Cole gave Loki a miniature frisbee to play with
sometime later water began appearing in Loki's food bowl
curious about how water was getting into Loki's dry food Cole set up video cameras to find out
she discovered that Loki had turned his toy frisbee into a tool
crows like their food moistened so the brainy bird used the frisbee to scoop water out of his bath pan and carry it to his food bowl where he poured it onto his chow
later Loki used a cup that Cole gave him
Loki developed this behavior all on his own says Cole but if I hadn't given him the frisbee it wouldn't have never happened
he figured that out he's smart huh
blast with bubbles
we didn't know what the reaction would be says elephant handler Sean Graham who blew bubbles from a machine he brought inside the elephant barn
five Asian elephants that Graham takes care of tore around chasing them like a bunch of excited kids
they opened their mouths stuck out their tongues and tried to catch the bubbles xxx
do you think they would do that
can you imagine
they just like kids did
look at
he's opening his mouth
I think you had a cold did you have trouble sleeping last night
you kept getting up
is that because your nose was all stuffy
yeah
do you have a cold
beary generous
like all spectacled bears boo+boo and Rosie go wild over fruit
you might think they'd squabble over it but these two cooperate
in the wild these bears browse for their food sniffing out the fruits they like to eat and climbing trees to get them
so the zoo+keepers drilled holes in an empty five gallon jug and filled it with apples grapes and raisins
they strung this contraption on a pipe and mounted it on the animals' climbing apparatus
to reach the food boo+boo and Rosie would have_to stand upright then spin the jug to make the food come out through the holes
Rosie stood up to reach the apparatus right away to get at the yummy smelling fruit
but boo+boo simply sniffed and then lay down under the climbing equipment with his paw out
all he had to do was wait for the food Rosie dropped as she spun the tumbler
I think he was capable of spinning the tumbler says Chris Waldren assistant curator of carnivores but he's clever enough that he gets her to do it
which she did and still does every time
Rosie does all the work and he gets all the treats
I think they've come to some sort of agreement perhaps or maybe one of these days Rosie will wake up hungry as a bear and it will be every mammal for himself
here's where they put the fruit see
yep
how come he doesn't do it
he wants to watch her
and then he gets the prizes
xxx ooh

stare at the black dot in the center of the image slowly move your head toward the image then away from it
the circles should appear to turn around or rotate ready
oh yeah it's doing it
look at the black dot okay you just looking at the black dot
now does it look like the circles around it are moving
this happens because the pattern confuses certain cells in your brains that are responsible for interpreting lines and curves
okay ready

xxx so the only one that doesn't look like moving is this one
that one I I don't see moving
that's cool

does it look like the the circle's moving around it
what
okay
just call me Doctor Petey
it says
healing hooves
horsing around is allowed at Akron children's hospital at least when Petey visits
hospitals can be scary so the Shetland pony miniature horse mix brings fun and comfort to sick kids
some kids haven't smiled for a long time but they light up when they see Petey
he lays his head on the children's beds and his eyes get big and soft
the thirteen year old gets three baths and is sprayed with safe for horses disinfectant before making his hospital rounds
after every visit Miller rewards Petey with his favorite treats peppermint candy and popcorn
then he goes back to his farm where he likes to chase other horses and sneak out of his pen
Petey is an angel at the hospital but at home he's a little devil
he visits sick children at the hospital
is that cool
if you were in the hospital would you like to get visit by a horse
look at him
yeah
he makes the sad children happy
right
because those kids are sad because they have_to be in the hospital
