yes
no it's Sweet Pea
what's his name
what was the name Ross
no that can't be
let's ask Mom
no of course not
it's a car
it's a limousine
are you going to go to bed right after your bath
how come you're going up stairs
because you're a twerp
right
no I did not say that was the main reason
well that's the main reason
did I say that
well maybe I did
I don't think I did I think Ross
I said
that's very good Ross
so this idea of main reason is is something that he sort of inferred
oh maybe I did say that was was the main reason
yeah I guess I did
okay I said that was the main reason and Ross repeated it
you're right Ross I said it
she is a darling Mommy shaving her darling legs
in my knowledge I don't know
what does knowledge mean Ross
you were about to tell us
don't stop now
not in your mind
in your mind knowledge means whether it's in your mind
if it's not in your mind then it's not in your knowledge
right
except for feeling those aren't knowledge
if you having feelings in your mind or ideas ideas well if you have feelings in your mind those aren't knowledge those are feelings
and then when they say
use your noggin
they don't really mean that they mean your knowledge
how do you know that's the bone
how did you know it was the bone Ross
because I noticed it before you did right
um and he's right it is a kind of a little bone end onto the bone on the end of the sword
here it is Ross
what do you mean
play an ice cube
oh you mean Rubik's Cube
would you please take that into your bed Ross
I mean go to bed right now
you didn't really want a real cat did you
what else Ross
what did you want to say about a story
no you can't bring anything only bring one thing in there only bring one thing
that's a new rule
that's like you can't go into the area when there's a square when there's an x on it that's a rule okay
uhuh
ah no
you can only take one toy
that's the rule
because that's the rule
that's enough now Ross you eat the rest
you see my penis
yeah I can see it
so what
what are you going to do with it
by the way that was a a joke on Ross's part
although he might not have thought realized how funny it was
that means the last one
yeah I will
but I can't come right now
right
which was Ross and Icey
right actually though what but what interests me about that was the sort of he Ross has developed sort of a bit Marky talk dialect which is
he wants you he loves you
he repeats things for Mark to make sure that Mark understands
yeah it's sort of
he doesn't use big sentences with Mark uses nice clear little sentences
you know Mark said Roshie to Ross because Ross says Roshie to Mark in that baby+talk
yeah right my name is Roshie right
you're full huh
well that she probably she looks thou she probably does look the way she looks in the picture
the big lie is that they are trying to tell me without saying it in words that uh I will look just like her if I use that
oh I farted
fart is not a bad word
that's not a bad word
don't talk with your mouth full
and I say nothing right
I tried but there's no more pee
