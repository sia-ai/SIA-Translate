did you know that Count Dracula was a Hungarian
Transylvanian
yeah
and we taught you about that
do you think he was a nice man
what about Count Chocula
is he okay

why
because he makes people eat those horrible chocolate things
they're pretty horrible aren't they
do you think Frankenberry's pretty bad too

yeah
I think donuts are pretty bad too
have you ever had donuts

well we could just do that
we could do that all the time
we don't even have_to buy the Honey Nut Cherrios
okay I'm going to turn that light off now
you mean your shoes off right
okay now let's start back at the beginning
how did he free all of his friends
okay what did he do
what kind of money was it Ross
who's the bunny
was he a real rabbit
I'm listening now
who were the bad people
do you remember their names
sheriff of of Notingham was he a bad person
who else
was the king a bad person
what did the king do
sucked his thumb
he jumped out and they were free
I see
and why did the king suck his his thumb
do you remember why that happened
because it had some chocolate on it
did it have chocolate on it
his thumb
is that why the king sucked his thumb
because it had had chocolate on it
why did he suck it then
okay
I see
and when did Robin Hood go back in the forest
