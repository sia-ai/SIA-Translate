I knew she had it worse
well it wasn't the hyper extension you see the fiber hyper extending that actually tore a little of the bone
they had to pin the rest back
I understand she had to go back into a cast that she had taken it off on my account
good morning
good morning
we are all early risers and apparently Jenny also because her sister is a bed+hog so she never gets up until her sister gets up
did you come out here and react to your grandma
I asked how she slept and she said she slept well but Dana takes up most of the bed
and Dana is in the Jenny is against the wall
do you know that in situations Jenny likes small little spaces so this works very well
I may let her sleep on the is that one of the peaches that I bought
no that's one of mine
they are a little ripe you have_to cut out some of the
your ankle is hurt
well here sit down and I'll take a look at it
I'll take a look at it
can I watch tv
not this morning
come on it's boring
tv is boring honey just right
okay I'm going to go watch it
no you can't watch
no you can't watch
can I have that
yeah
I'll get her a sweater
she's a little bit chilly
yes she needs something for the cold
mom I'm getting cold
well I'll get you a sweater here
there isn't anything good on
mommy made a mistake really Jen
what time is it
ah no
no no no
it's only eight fifteen
this is Candid_Camera not so candid now but
did you sleep well last night
did you hear me come in
well then you slept well
did you hear that you completely monopolized the bed
hey last year she did it
this year I did it
did you think to yourself she did it last year I'll do it this year
well I think that she was trying to get under the cover which was nearly off her
well her feet were out too
it was all up around her neck
yes it is around Jeeky's neck
so I pulled it down
so there you are Jeeky
you know what you did
but her feet were totally out from under the cover
you had all the covers
anytime the cover keeps being pulled away
you keep I think they had it around their necks
Dana's bottom was beginning to show a little bit and Jenny's feet were out
you call it cute Dana
well not really honey it was just
Jeeky when did you wake up
oh seven forty
that's about right because we heard her clock ring when she was in here talking
I wonder what had happened to Elaine Joyce since her husband died so suddenly
you know Bobby Van died very suddenly of a brain tumor
here she is on the cover of the preview section
she has a part in a new series
what do you want Cheerios or Rice_Krispies
whenever my stomach gets a little queasy I eat pretzels
evergreen
have you ever read Evergreen
who is it by
Melva Plain
oh I had never heard of it
could you let me see this
I hate that girl
her name is Dana Plato
she is a terrible actress
she just makes a fool of herself on the show Different_Strokes
so stupid
I mean I love Different_Strokes but she makes it all queer
have you ever seen the show Different_Strokes
doesn't she queer it all up
Jeeky are you done with the funnies
oh what's next
oh she's going to show you it works Dana
it works
the combination of your two things
I'm going in the water with that today too
that's mine
oh it is
did you get that for your birthday Jenny
I got it this summer
Dana the comics are right behind you
Jenny's done
then I'm next
that's the highlight of my morning
I save it until last
I love those comics
they're light
do you remember last week's Sunday Smith Dana
what
do you remember last week's Sunday Snuffy_Smith
they were getting to go on a campout and Snuffy_Smith and the little guy
oh it was so funny
you know it's a bunch of hillbillies
and she was just crying
no stop your sniffing your mom
and they're getting in the mule
what's the mule's name anyway
and she says Ralph you go along and I'll stay home for three days
and as_soon_as they get out_of sight she's rolling on the floor laughing saying three whole days to myself
I got such a bang out_of three whole days by myself
they go slowly and then they start up like that
that's from grandmother Kelly right
yours is too
yeah I know
you fill it backwards from the start
oh are we going to show them Lego_Land
oh yeah she was talking about her Space Legos
let's go in the living room
I'll take my tea in there
I like to sit in there
it was jewish family and physically the old hollering kind
it drove me crazy
I was so tired by the time I finished I could hardly stand it
they would hassle each_other you know the mother would
I never bother with authors
I could give you the name of a good book
did you get that one
it was an upper intellectual type
the theme looked like a good one and I picked it up and brought it home and it was awfully good
she had been an extremely successful author and she died at the age of seventy two
she had received several awards
she wrote an article at the beginning that she was the first woman who lived you could ever find
she walked out on her husband and wrote and her kids too
she was jewish too
but but she wrote with her grammar like they spoke in those days
she came over an immigrant from Poland and she went to night school
so all that writing was just kind of put on
she went back to her childhood and you know poor grammar the way they actually spoke in those without an education
it was awfully good
I and I can't remember the name of it
I surely want to get it and read it
it was so good
it was a series of stories in one book
oh it was good and you would have liked it
I know you would have liked it
I don't like those either but that one I did
I didn't
it was serious when I picked it out
it was her whole life
see it went on so it fit together
I got_to get away so I don't see it
she's not able to do all that work
I suspect that if he can't do it he would wind up physically much less well
that's a typical pattern when you can't do the stuff even a much lower level
well he's seventy two years old
but he has the capacity to sit down and sleep like that I do not have
that's right so presumably
but when you sleep over your coffee that's pretty bad
but presumably he does the same thing I do
when I'm working out in the yard sometimes I'll just stop although I know I can do it
I would pay a price
do you know where I got the idea from
well aren't you supposed to make things from these pictures
I know how to make it from looking at it
it's pretty easy
be careful
watch out for that
don't
give it back to me right now
I want it back
I don't care
don't
I'm not letting you do anything
I didn't ruin anything
it just fell out
but you let it fall
I told you not to let it fall
I didn't this fall
that guy just fell off
how is it any different Jen
I didn't let it fall
did it break
but I didn't let it fall
I said the guy fell
it was loose
no it was not loose
I put it on tight
well it fell off
they're out there playing now aren't they
it's alright Jen
you've got your knickers on come on
boy you know I got a mosquito bite on my face yesterday
come sit here Dana
I'll fix your pony
feels good
find the brush
dad just goes like this
he gets it and then he throws it around the leg
well what does Joe do
he goes like this
dad goes like real fast
well watch Joe
I wonder who is winning
he sort of aims
doesn't Joe look funny in blue jeans
he's cute
that was close
but look he did better than Joe did
I bet they just have different styles don't they Jenny
mom but he doesn't be careful about his aim
but there are no points alright unless you can win
that I don't know
I do not know the rules of this game
I'll play Dana and I bet you nobody will get a ring
but I bet you nobody will
we found out that mask was too big
yes but you know what we've learned
we've learned how to pick one out
did you see Kinny giving that lesson Jen
was it to you dear or was it to Dana
it was to Dana
you stuck on the nose and see if it stays
that would have been the perfect place to have had a mask
wouldn't it have been Jen
the water was so clear
which quarry did you like better
the second one
this one or the one last year
oh
I like them both the same but I really like the one last year because it was big
and no masses in the middle just one big place to swim around
and the other place had a shallow end too
and you could dive in the other one
I like this one because we were the only ones there
I know
and there were only two other people three other people all men besides us there last year
there were more than that
there was a boy sitting on the rocks and you borrowed their inner tube
remember that
that's the one I'm talking about
then there were the kids over up higher
there were those students up on top of the rocks
there were a bunch of students up on the rocks
but they weren't really there
they were diving
but they were there
you could feel that they were there
it wasn't
I like crowds you know Ma
do you
but that wasn't a crowd
no it's true
it wasn't a crowd
Jenny I have_to find you another bottle
they're never going to score again
we play it you get one point for the closest person
but they're not scoring at all
no leaners no ringers no anything else
they'll be pitching all day
no they won't
not if they decided to do it my way
I don't have this high enough
I like Penny
penny falls and I like her
penny is a sweet girl
how old is Penny's mother
well she's twelve years old
you know Woody has been awfully close mother
dad likes dogs
I can tell that
he always like to play
I want a dog like Angie and like that black dog that Larry has
did you like those spotted dogs that were out on the farmhouse
unhunh
they didn't chase at all
they didn't chase
I like Magpie
I like cute dogs that run fast
I like Magpie
I like those big dogs
Angie's very well trained too
I can dress him
I can
do you know how to dress Dan
yes Jennifer
I don't know
how do you do it
you say dress Angie dress and Angie puts his nose through and then you kind of push it his collar
oh really
is Angie in the white house that is across from us
are those same kids going to be back there next year
well actually some of them left
but the one who owns Angie did not leave yet
why you don't like them
they are very noisy Dana
they cooled down now
they're nice though
they may be nice but they're noisy
Dana if she doesn't want it you can't do it
because she's letting it grow out now
besides when she's ten years I told her she could do as Dana does
I want it down Ma
do you want to keep bangs or not
yes
even though I do need a hair+cut
you certainly do
shall we trim them today
they're almost in your eyes
if you want your hair cut we'll go and get it cut
I want about this much cut because I hate it when it always goes to one side or the other and I hate that
but if it is up over my shoulder it will just go back
why don't your pony down and see what you want from there
not really mom
it makes me too nervous
I remember you would go to the bridge club
yeah
I haven't done it in a couple of years though
you did it last year
as recently as last year
yes
the years don't go that fast
they do to me
oh yeah because you're getting to be so old
we could braid it or something so it wouldn't feel so heavy
would that help
mine has got a long ways to go
Kenny's just about ten years younger than you
no he's just about thirteen years younger than I am
did you say thirty four in December mother
oh then you're only three years older than him
that's just like me and Dana
you're three years older than who
Larry
and he's the oldest
I'm the oldest
no I know of the boys
of the boys yes
and then how many years older than Cliff
five
me and Kenny are the same
so they're two apart
and Cliff and Kenny are how many years apart
eight
so you're thirteen years apart
I was your age Jen when Ken was born
I felt like it
oh I loved him dear and I
no
you guys have another baby
not at all interested in that at all
oh my dear it isn't a good idea at all
I'm sick of Jennifer
I'm sick of Dana
so what are you going to do about it
I thought about just making this in one braid Dana
how about that
one braid yuck
that is so disgusting
one braid in the back
I like it
Dana why don't you put your pony even lower then it wouldn't swing in front
yes it would
I hate it when it's lower because then it's not off my neck
what I like is to have it totally on
hey let's do that
no because I don't like that style
nobody will see it
but I don't like it
remember in gymnastics
how about we braid it and you wear it just the way you would in a society party
no
I do not no
I think Jo you could with me tomorrow and get your hair cut too
I did it
you did it
yes
are you sure
but I don't if it stayed on
he thought you were applauding him
I think he would hear it ring
yeah but sometimes they come right like that and they don't ring
it rung
does that clock bother you at night
you would think it would but you get used to it so fast
I'm going to stick all that hair up
he went a little farther
Joe almost did it
oh I hope Penny isn't in any danger
how old is Penny now
but if it bounces and then goes on to the ring does it count
yeah
absolutely
like if it bounced here and then goes on
I think Joe got a ringer
anytime you've got your horse+shoe around the stake no matter how it got there you've got a ringer
too far
Joe's are a little bit short
and daddy's are usually a little short
they're sort of about this far apart
could you go around the other way
not really
but you could have gone just around altogether
I'm voting for both of them
you're voting for both of them
do they usually count it up
oh sure
it's a competition
it is
sure
any game is
hey you know we have_to figure how to work that game of yours
mine
oh yeah the gold thing
yeah we really do
it looks interesting
I'm going to play first with dad
no with me
no with dad
Karen and I were going to play first
do you have_to play first on everything Jen
yes
with my toys I do
I like that game
I want some breakfast some breakfast some breakfast
look your bowl is there and there are two boxes of cereal in the corner in the kitchen
forget them
Cheerios they're so nutritious
I hate Cheerios
they have no taste whatsoever
they don't need taste
they're packed with vitamins
well eat some Rice_Chex
have you tried Rice_Chex
I love Rice_Chex
how about corn flakes
no flavor in them
I need something with flavor
corn flakes
frosted corn flakes
Dana we don't get sugared cereal
what are you talking about
things have not changed
you've got_to pick that up girl
I'm going to clear everything up all the garbage
I want my tennis shoes
I think they're in the bed+room actually
well I don't really know the way
you're thinking of a prism
there is a prismatic effect in there but it's not really
Dana named him and I don't like the name
if you can a rainbow on this thing then you can try
why not Jen
why don't you just let me do it
no no no no
this is mine not yours
I know but you might just want to give me one and have you have one so we could have a little war going on
no
these are both mine
I have an idea
what if when Dana uses it she can call it whatever she wants to call it
but you have your name for it right
but your name would be the real name
then you're going to have fun having a war without two people
god you're so mean
you could have so much fun but you're totally blind to it
it probably won't work on that plush rug
I don't believe that Jenny you know sometimes you think that
he just goes
can I play with it
and he ran it out_of batteries and I tried it and it didn't even work on solar power
Keeran's ones worked
he was using his blue and he asked if I could use the blue car and when I came in
I don't know about that
I tried it and it didn't work
my dad said it was the batteries but he goes
I know how you feel somebody breaking your car on the first day
dad won't do it
I already asked him
Dana said she already asked you
I was just waiting around
in the bed+room Jen
Ma
the butter is not melted
it was the best I could darling
try it
see if you like it
how was the cereal by the way
yucky
grandma is watering her trees
what time do you think we should leave
about eleven thirty
that sounds about right
if she had a pocket it would be perfect
should we get you a shirt with pocket Jen
do you want a bribe so we can play your game
that's from dad sorry
that's from me
so_that dad and I can play
oh excuse me dad
I'll give her one of each color
well I thought I you were giving her the whole thing
I'm not that stupid
I won't give her the whole thing just to play some stupid game
if it's stupid how come you want to play
because I'm interested
what conclusion do you draw from that
what conclusion do you draw from what Dana is interested in
no don't Dana
no
I not an egg
make like an egg and scramble dad
play me a game
are you crazy or something
I know it's too much
you can close that little window over there
Jennifer I don't want to play your little game
you know it's going to rain
it's very humid out
I have two prescriptions I would like you to refill please
you know he runs around from spot to spot when I go in there you know
I killed one the other night
there were two
you know you have a cricket in your bath+room
he was a fraternity boy
you know all these things
you were on this morality trip back then
I think that if they lived in this area that we would happy to get together for holidays
of course we would see a_lot_of them
and we'd get along just fine
I think that what we have in common is more than what we don't
he's very nice
I have found I got a very good reception from
well he would say all sorts of political things you know how France going down the tubes
they just had the elections
oh he's very conservative
but after all he is in fact american
you know I find it weird seeing really wholesome otherwise people smoke
like the chairman of the U_C_L_A department is a very grandfatherly type
garland smokes
when did she start doing that
well we all did a bit in college
she got addicted and you didn't
well are you sorry that you stopped smoking
I wouldn't have done it
I would have done what I wanted to do
how's that
Granddaddy didn't smoke did he
never
so this was a sort of wild living phase uncle Bruce went through
that's right
it was one of those great sorrows of grandmother's life
that he went into wild living
well that he smokes
well it turned out that he isn't much into wild living
you wouldn't know talking to him now
did he remain methodist
or is he a catholic
no
I don't think so
is Donny a catholic
yes
assuming kids are raised catholic
did Anne remain a methodist
Milton is methodist
I don't think they've been inside a church for a long time
when Rene was visibly pregnant and not married they shot her off to LasVegas telling them they had to get married and preferably by a methodist minister
on the other hand I think maybe grandma said that so maybe it was
and it all worked out beautifully including the baby
grandma had conniptions and I think grandma took the attitude that she was standing by Renee in this terrible tragedy
what was the deal
that they were living in sin for a long time
no
not Renee and Robert
that wasn't fashionable back in those days
what were those days
a long time ago
kids are in their teens now
mid sixties
she got pregnant while she was a college freshman and this was during the summer
the baby was born christmas day
and it was during the summer that it was discovered she was pregnant
christmas day really
she just had this one year of college which was his senior year
he was a year younger than me and had a kid
no half a year younger than you and have a kid
but she doesn't need it
she's smart enough
what did she end up doing
nothing
a nice housewife living very very
he was a senior so he graduated and he's a contractor
so she's one of the very last of the fifties wives
that's right
but you remember she's very much like her mother
Renee and Ann are right out_of the same mold
they're beginning to look alike
they're really incredible
the easy going style
so Renne the Valour kids must be pushing middle age at just this point
middle age begins at fifty five
she got one foot over thirty already
Sam was born in nineteen forty four
Renee was born in nineteen forty four
oh my god
that's approaching the magic moment
listen the amazing thing is that Pam had a child rather that late and everything is fine
isn't it
no
nowadays more and more women are having their first child at the age of thirty five
but that's dangerous
no it isn't
it's not dangerous until after forty
it's dangerouser
I wonder if the statistics will back you up on that
I think that if they do this amniocentesis women over thirty five if there's real reason to believe that they might have problems
I think a normal woman at thirty five having her first child they don't do it with
they may do it more routinely for women having their first child after the age of thirty
is that a dangerous procedure
apparently
I didn't realize that
I thought oh how marvelous
but apparently there's a
why can't they just stick a needle in
well they do
but maybe the needle might go into the wrong place
oh come on
they have all sorts of better scanning devices
I don't know
I've heard that you have whether it's important to do this or not
I don't want to have a needle stuck in me
but it certainly is marvelous for people having their first child after forty or having their first child with a complicated medical history after thirty five to know that your child is not going to have any defects
any
critical ones that they worry about
I thought that there were other genetic defects
it would show any variation in the chromosome structure right
Constant_Comment I think my mother had that fifty years ago
hi
my name is Dana
I am thirteen years old
wait a minute
shouldn't it be on record rather than play
it's on record
hi
I am Dana_Kelley
I am the narrator for this story
I am thirteen years old and I will introduce you to the characters who will be talking
this is Jinky
say hi Jinky
hi
and this is Woody
he is god knows thirty nine
say hi Woody
and this Sherry
she is thirty eight
these are the people you will be hearing on this tape
now Dana be quiet
Dana that was very nice
thank_you
mommy can I have a pill
a what
pill
mom I'm not kidding
what did she say
I'm not kidding
she asked me if she could have a pill
but it's true
what kinds are there
do you want a aspirin pill or a stomach pill
which kind of pill do you want
that's what I don't understand
I want a stomach pill
why do you want a stomach pill
my stomach hurts
are you sure about that
I think she's just nervous
Jennifer do you want the microphone on you
no
what we're supposed to be doing is having a normal conversation
okay
can I have a tissue
did you get it Jen
the pill just sort of slipped down
well I bet everybody is going to feel a little bit funny until we get used to it
the problem with having an Archie comic is that you won't speak
Archie comic books are the kind of reading that ten year olds like
says the narrator
from now on I'm going to keep my mouth closed
is that why you got the small mouth award
you can't get me on that mommy
well now I'm going to read Archie
why do you want to read Archie
did you know that baseball is best on radio
I think so too
it really isn't as good on television
except for an occasional great fight when you really want to see
well that's like gymnastics
gymnastics is great on television
yeah gymnastics wouldn't be too good on radio
but that element of the sport is the same when there is simply a fantastic contortion of the body or body control or something like that
oh I just realized something
the microphone is on
it was on before when you were
do you know what's on tonight
no
I won't hear of it
do you know what you did earlier this evening and what you did earlier this evening
I'm not saying I want to
I'm just telling you
it's Monday night it's Shirley and Laverne
I watched that once
it's stupid
I wonder if there is any way we could only get c_bs occasionally
yes
do you know that soon we will be able to get public television
here
in the air
without the cable
we are soon going to be putting a super antenna
I don't want public television
who's putting that up
I don't know
but they petitioned the city to put it up and I guess it's just caught up in red tape
who petitioned the library
I don't know what it is
it needs an antenna that the zoning plans and it means that whether you'll be able to get public television whether you're on cable or not
because they'll pick up the signal and rebroadcast it
I don't know
well what do you mean we'll be able to get every channel
no just public television
we'll be able to get public television which has some pretty nice stuff
like what
then if we could just unget C_B_S
stupid concerts with people of the public
no
they have on these great movies these great old movies
they often have wonderful series from England
that's right Upstairs_Downstairs Peter_Whimsey the mysteries
they're really good
you know I kind of miss Peterwhimsey every once in a while
all I remember is the Rumpoles
how about that great science fiction show Doctor Who
it's on here
it's been on here for the last three years
I don't know
it's hard for me to know
I hate public television
he said you were doing so brilliantly he was going to put in six more rubber bands
Jen would you like some salad
want some more brocolli
I want some dessert
we've got little oranges
we have peaches
stop it Jennifer
I'm so sorry
no we have them both
does it not taste good
it tastes terrible
is this what they call a hands+on experience
Jennifer you're doing the dishes tonight
no I'm not
yes you are
make me
I'm not doing the dishes
no that wouldn't get the dishes done
really I'm not doing the dishes
really you are
I said I didn't want to come to the table
but notice where you are
you are at the table
that's true right
Dana do you want more rice
don't put the top back on
don't put the top back on
that's only with coke
well Dana we have figured out that Jenny's team cannot possibly do any worse than first place
oh my god that's terrible
if they lose every game and one of the teams wins all of three of their games
Dana the only issue is whether you're going to get four five or six points out_of three games
I don't think they will though
no I would just like the green team to tie Brit's
no I would like the green team to beat Brit's
yeah so would I
it's not Brit's team
that's right
we are identifying it as Brit's team but it isn't Brit's team
we should say Julie's team
no
we should say the cone team
yeah and also
yeah the Coneheads
who scored the goal in the game
it was the coach's daughter
no it was not
that's the library person
that was the Bosworth girl
oh that's even better
see they do
the green you're talking about the green
no about the person who scored the one goal
that's not true
it doesn't matter
it doesn't really matter
no I was telling you that they put up a strong front line which meant that we should be able to control it in mid field
weren't you trying to get four forwards against them
no
who was it then
much better to run a defense person against them because I'm hiding people in the center not up front any more
we did better against them when I hid people up front
am I crazy
we're talking about soccer
am I really doing this
talking about soccer
about kid soccer yes
daddy I've got a good idea
do you think that we should go to watch the girl's high school soccer team
I think that that would be fun
let's keep an eye out for
by the way J_J's got a party going
I want a Haloween party for once
every year it's J_J's party
oh does she want something else
oh no
have you even listened to half the things she's wanted in the last hour
we don't have that much paper
even with the university supplying it
oh come on
I don't think you have that much brain dad and you're pretty smart
he is
that depends on whether I give her everything she asks for or not
if I do I'm pretty smart
hey dad will you go out and get some ice cream
yeah dad you're pretty smart dad
and if he doesn't
what were all the things that were wrong with our car mom
I'll show you the bill then we'll go through it
no it was exactly what either what I knew was wrong or had to have checked
okay because there are little oranges which you can have or peaches
we don't want any
I might be willing to go and get some ice cream in a while but I'm not going to do it right now
probably after dishes right
are you kidding
we just got a humongous bill for the car
well we're lucky
we got everything up to the catalytic converter
the catalytic converter just cost us three hundred fifty dollars
on the bottom of the car there tail+pipe muffler pieced into the catalytic converter
oh my god
I'm glad you didn't get the xxx car
we should have had the car in there a long time ago really
nope when the whole thing snapped it was all_gone it was because it was rusted through
are you talking about the car
year I just had the whole thing replaced
you got a new car
no no no a new muffler
as_well_as the lights
also a new light
what about a tire
were they able to resurrect that tire
they resurrected a tire and they put the four snows on
and they put what
the four snow tires on
and they did the lube and oil change
and the air filter apparently was almost disintegrated
maybe that was the sound we were hearing
no no no the air filter was
no I don't mean that we heard it disintegrating but that we heard that it wasn't doing its job
that could be
it was the engine really I'm pretty sure
that could be
since the oil was dirty and we had to get a whole new set of sparks
oh my gosh
well that's not bad but then they retuned the when they put in the new sparks they also retuned the valve the valve timing
sparks
the sparks are spark plugs
what do the spark plugs do
they provide electricity or energy that you need when air and gas are going to get mixed up and burn
so its like a match on a piece of paper
you've got_to have the paper and you have_to have the air and you have_to make it pop someplace to make it burn right
the spark does that
in six different places in the car its going boom boom boom like little explosions inside the car and its pushing a big it's pushing what's called a piston just a thing down and that thing down is turning a wheel
that thing that's turning the wheel eventually turns the wheels of the car
and that's how a car runs
sounds pretty primitive doesn't it
yet when you stop to think about it we get an awful lot of mileage and speed and stuff out_of something that's a pretty primitive system
how much do Chevrolets cost now
eight thousand dollars
we went by the car show at the xxx
eight thousand dollars is right
that's not much
that's a stripped down Chevrolet too probably isn't it
Jenny that was the little Chevrolet
that was a car not even as big as our car
our car would be ten thousand dollars would you say
our car no
our car right now is costing me
it's still a very good buy
I thing it's costing at least this past year I don't know the new modern prices
this past year it was costing a little over eight thousand dollars for that Ford Fairmont
we paid forty five hundred dollars
well do you realize we can't afford to ever buy a new car
it's true
this is it
we'll have_to walk to peg and xxx
no we'll have_to take very good care of our car
are you serious
no
I'm serious
I think of the Abels and certainly the people we know with a car
certainly of the people we know the Abels could afford a new car if they had to
but right now a new car would cost them essentially as much as their boat did a couple years ago right
oh I don't know
well their boat was ten thousand dollars and
dad why don't you just use a spoon
I get some too
yeah
yeah it has_to be divided evenly
the person who divvies it up is the person who gets second choice don't forget
gets second choice
don't use your fingers
yuck
Jennifer the xxx just drop it into bowls
just kidding
what
where can I punch him
I touched both bowls dad
dad come on
don't
she's doing her best
don't fuss
come on
she is
I'm not
okay I won't touch it
good
dad a larger spoon would make sense Dana
okay you're getting the ones that go on the floor
that's a requirement
I don't care
I said I'm nothing special
you don't know which is yours
dad we have_to start thinking about Halloween really
okay
come on
Jenny you pick the one you want
keep in mind that two of them are going to Dana
wait
why are you giving her that one
okay
I'm taking this
you didn't have_to put them in there
you're right
I didn't
take them out
do what you want with them
I don't care
what xxx for generations have called martyrdom
martyrdom
oh wait a minute
wait a minute
there are exactly six left in the can which means four for Jinky and two for Dana
these oranges taste like poison
don't eat them then
mom I'm still thinking about the Marriott_hotel
Marriott
the Marriott
is that what you said
the Marriott
oh that was a nice
the one in Kansas_city
did I tell you
no the wonderful one in Syracuse
mom and dad grandma where was that
remember the one in Kansas_city fell down last year
I don't think that was the Marriott
was it the Marriott or the Hyatthouse
yeah I think it was the Hyatthouse
yeah Hyatthouse
it had such a wonderful swimming+pool
wasn't that the one where you walked in and it was so warm
yes
it was delicious
well that's not quite the word for it but
want a bit of my cabbage
no
it was like a sauna
the whole room was
want any more of the xxx
no I have it
dad you know how hot a sauna is
the whole room was like a sauna
yeah but then you don't want to leave there that's the problem
so you get dressed in it so you'll be warm then
I would think something between that and what's out at the Sheridan would be about right
is the Sheridan cold
well the water is cold
is the air cold
no the air is kind of warm
mom I thought the water it was warm
