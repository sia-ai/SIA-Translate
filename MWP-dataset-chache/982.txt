Maggie you entered this world as a fighter and a survivor
already you have been a_lot_of fun and a challenge
above all sweet girl
I am blessed by and very proud of you
all my love Daddy
and Mommy is on the back of the card
she wrote a lot
oh Maggie_moo I love you so much
I could kiss your sweet little face all day and I do
you are so dear to me my precious child
I stand in wonder and amazement at your steady growth and all the new things you do slowly one at a time
but also so quickly because time is going by so fast
that's right
Daddy and Mommy wrote something for Maggie
uhoh where's that potpourri
a shoe
shoe
oh let's put the shoe in there
how about
look
shoe
in the can
I praise God for the wonderful little being he made
and for the privilege of raising you
and seeing your personality unfold
God has taught us so much
oh sweetie
let's move this fan back a bit
move it back a bit
there we go
that's better
that's better
see what else Mommy says
God has taught us so much past
so much this past year through you
the most important of which for me has been more devotion to him
particularly
particularly through the stance we had to take regarding your baptism
he has used you to bring your mom closer to himself
and I hope and pray with all my heart that he uses your mom and dad to bring you close close to himself
through Jesus
learn to love Jesus little one
that's the most important thing in life
in Jesus's love
Mommy
do you like that card sweetie+pie
Mommy and Daddy

we want the best for our little daughter
we want the best for our little daughter
