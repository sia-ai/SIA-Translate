those two parts fit together perfectly
one piece works and one piece doesn't
I'm just going to sit over here
what
yeah that was pretty funny
what
oh it doesn't have a hole
holes look like squares
oh I didn't know that
and sometimes they don't
you have_to make some holes in it so people can fit in it
who comes at your house when I'm at school
oh
how's it going
are you just about through painting
how are you going to dry it off
oh you're going to use a hankie to blot the excess paint off
I thought that it was long
what are you doing now
what is the excess paint
oh the stuff that's not dry
who is that for
oh
why
oh I see

cowboys are hard workers
yeah as_soon_as we go outside
did you go look in the mirror to see your purple mustache
here you go
a raccoon
I thought you looked like a mean cowboy
what do you mean what happened to them
they got what
sick
a stethoscope
oh I see
you're right
they must be sick
I don't know
it looks like they're playing a game
the elephants are playing Robin_Hood
it really is
I'm gonna pick them up okay
you do
and some yellow ones
that's a tall stack isn't it
did a tornado come knock it down
remember
we saw one on the Wizard of Oz
it's when the wind blows so hard that it forms a big funnel and it knocks down everything that's in its path
a paper shovel
can I use it
I'll be careful
what are you doing Abe
oh
I think this one's different
uhhuh
I thought you had a box of caps up here
maybe they're out here
nope
the caps
do you see them
oh you're going to wear a mask
now you look like a raccoon
you look like a raccoon with that mask on
okay
where are you going Abe
who are you
don't shoot me please please
no I said no
oh
oh okay what's your name bad cowboy
Abe
oh I thought you were somebody else
I know a boy named Abe
I know a boy named Abe too
do you know who he is
he's my son
do you know what
he's my son too
don't shoot
okay did you take your gun to school today
what did you think when you got to school
what did you think when you got_to school and you didn't have your gun
you didn't worry about your gun
don't shoot
do you want to have a shootout
what are you doing Abe
I'm standing still
you're still as a statue
what
this is a gun
do you know what a statue is
a statue is a thing that
uh next time we go to the park I'll show you a statue
I'll show you a statue
I'll show you two different statues
that's a statue of a cowboy
and that's a statue of a turtle
see how still they are
they don't move
a statue of the three little pigs
I haven't seen one
you did
hey are you going to put your jacket on
I can't wear your jacket Abe
I'm not a poop poop
I never rip stuff
I always sew up the stuff you rip
I always do the mending
do you want me to be mean
put up your dukes
who's going to cook your breakfast
how are you going to eat
okay
okay everyone who sees you is going to go
oh_no a robber
everyone who sees you will go
oh_no a raccoon with a gun
they'll say
Cowboy x came to town
yeah
are we outside Abe
oh that's a big lie if I've ever heard one
I put one in
it just holds one roll of caps at a time
I'll tell you what I'll bring
no I won't I won't
I was gonna bring two rolls
but I don't think you'll pop that many
let's go
did you get your boots off mister
let's get them off
let's get them off
watch me
did you show Daddy how that works
the toy you got at Leslie's party
I don't think these boots are going to fit you much longer
because they're so hard to get on
now let me fix you some hot chocolate
okay
we could
do you want to play poker
okay
who gave them to you
here you go
you're welcome Abe
are you ready to play poker
okay
it is
let me give you some more milk
yes I did
I didn't spill it
I knew exactly when to stop
I'll bring your money over so we can play with it okay
why won't I win
why can't I
look what I found back behind the tv
who put it there
I took it over to the table
because I thought that's where you were going to be
I just thought of a neat game if you want to try it
I'm going to put all of the money under one of these cups
then I'm going to move the cups all around
and then I'm going to ask you which cup the money's under okay
I'm going to put it under this cup okay
which cup is it under
how did you know that
why
I'll give you one white
oh toss it over
watch this
I'm going to show you how to play tiddlywinks see
go ahead and try
almost
good
okay what's your game
stack them up
I think you're doing just fine by yourself
it's getting pretty tall isn't it
stack what
do you want the colors together
like two whites two blues and two yellows
yeah they look pretty good together
because one's bright and one's dull
what does krite mean
oh are you playing good
oh krite
krite krite am I playing good
what do you say then
oh krite bite gite
oh
just a second let me unpack this stuff
and then I'll help you okay
no Abe what we need to do is get some thin wood
that's too thick
do you want to try making an ax with that wood
what's it have on it
a screw hole that's what it looks like
let me see it
I could use the file to make one
I think that if the handle was this big then
what
what were they using it for
did you hear your voice
did they play it back so you could hear yourself sing
hey did you tell Daddy about the candles
you made a candle
oh so you really had to blow hard to do it huh
no we need that one for the philodendron okay
okay
okay we'll do it in just a little while okay
did you tell Daddy how we got home from school today
it did take too long
you wanted to ride on it for a long time
oh
tell Daddy why you cried
so he wouldn't have_to walk
oh you wanted it to bring you here
that wasn't worth crying about I don't think
hey Abe
see what's on the floor
see
what you made Daddy
oh_boy
show him what you made for me
tell him about the things you put on it
fat cheeks
can I hang that on the wall Abe
I can't fly it yet
because there's snow on the ground
so I thought I'd hang it on the wall until springtime comes
oh it does say that
then what should I do with it
oh put them all together
I just love my flower kite
because it just looks so neat
okay let's think of all the tools we need to make an ax
what do we need to cut the board
and what do we need to make it smooth
a file
and what do we need to make it stick together
what makes things stick together
glue
should we draw a picture of it
make a design
Abe
what are you going to do with your ax after we make it
where is the dead pear tree
oh and if we find one
what are you going to do with the wood after you chop down the tree
that would be nice to share it all
what would you yell when it was falling down
oh then what
okay
what is that
how did it get that long
how did it get that long
what are you doing with it
oh do I look like a pretty flower now
what's Daddy going to be
oh just like the Wicked_Witch
nothing I was just sitting here melting
hey you know what
I don't
guess we can make that into an ax
no
you can't make an ax out_of a penis
well what is it
why do you pss pss all the time for
you were pretending
we will
what else did you do at school
yeah in a little while
how long would you like it to be
can't do it in one minute
it can't cook that fast
okay
are you through
oh do you want me to come wipe your bottom
how come
oh what a privilege
why do you like for me to wipe it
go out there and tell Daddy that
what do you mean I stink
don't you think it's your poop that stinks
aren't you afraid that I'll make it stink
how big
I'll try
I guess so
I have_to get the saw first
it's in the tool chest
okay
Abe Terry wants you to write her a letter okay
okay she'd really like that
I know
is this how big you want it
it has_to be bigger than that if you want to take it hunting okay
Abe Daddy's cutting the handle not the blade
there you go
that's the handle
now we have_to make the other thing right
the blade
I won't
or I'll try not to anyway
that's gonna be part of the ax okay
how about what
okay just a second
that's just part of the ax
okay just a second
do you think that's a baseball bat
we need to sand it
so you won't get hurt
if it has rough edges you might get splinters
let's go out in the hall and fix this okay
well let's try to make one
okay just a second come here
what about your ax
I think that we'll wait until tomorror to make the ax okay
it might be too late
there's a_lot_of babies sleeping now Abe
we'll make it tomorrow
we can play baseball now
hey what if I make one at school Monday
then it could be smooth and everything
here you can use this for a bat okay
where's the ball
that was a good idea
do you want me to throw the ball to you
okay almost
ready
oh almost
ready
no we'll do the blue one
then we'll do the yellow one
ready
then what'll happen
what if you miss
you won't
ready
you sure didn't
ready
okay ready
foul tip
ready
okay ready
another foul tip
the blue one
ready
wow
a home run
whoops
a miss
okay wow
what a hit
you got scared
but you hit it here whoops ready
almost
ready
oh okay ready
whoops
you missed it ready
good one ready
okay almost
how are you going to do that in my chair
oh I think you should stand on the floor
you might hurt yourself that way
okay
oh
huh
Abe what happened at the park
that sure surprised us
because we didn't expect you to fall in
and you did
where are they
I think they're in the wash
a sign
a sign like what
a sign like what
oh what do you want your sign to say
be a tree to not put on it
what does that mean
a wicked witch
okay here are the bottoms
these are just jammies
they're called red and blues a football jersey
because it looks like a jersey doesn't it
a j
uhhuh there you go
your stickers
oh_boy thank_you
what did you get
what
oh
we sure can
yeah let me get the stuff ready who's this
Brer_Bear
I don't see him
is that the hen that was with Robin_Hood
do you want to do this one
okay that's Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater
okay which ones do you want to do first
okay
I'm trying to be real careful
no see I didn't
sometimes what would happen if I ripped one
how long would you cry
oh
uhhuh this is the way the ladies ride
okay there's the napkin with the water
the hand
oh it doesn't have it
they probably forgot it
the artist who drew this book
do you want a cookie
why three
why do you want three
oh did you glue that on yet mister
what
I think I may have gotten that napkin too wet
look the gentleman has a different horse than the lady does
and the farmer has his own type of horse too
so we have_to figure out what their horses look like okay
think we can do that
no we'll look at the pictures
and you can tell me who that is
okay which one is he
that's correct
no I was careful
don't leave it in very long
all the glue's going to come off in the water
they're for another Mother_Goose nursery rhyme
here's your cookie
did you tell Daddy what we put in the cookies
how come
oh
I got all the ones that go to this one
I'm going to have_to empty some of that water out
just don't worry about it okay
help with what
sometimes if you put a_lot_of pressure on it it'll stick
no I didn't
if you're going to be so particular Abe we can put it up and do it another day
I'm sorry
you're putting that upside down
Abe you can't leave them in there that long
that takes all the glue off
and it won't stick
just leave it in the water for a second okay
do you understand now
okay
I've already taken all of these off
okay we'll do this one after we finish this one okay
look the gentleman rides one way
the lady rides another way
and the farmer rides this way
okay we have_to find out what the farmer is carrying
what
let me see
I guess they just want you to use your imagination and put those wherever you want to
that's a pretty good idea
sure that's a good idea
that's fine
let's go ahead and put the stickers on first
so we don't lose the stickers okay
here it is
I already picked it up
it looks like a proud horse doesn't it
that one looks like a proud horse
this one looks sad
uhhuh
he looks real proud to me
Daddy have you ever seen a horse cry
a couple times
I'm sure they can feel sad sometimes
oh
no I think it'll fit
you have_to put it in the water first
just for a second get it out
fast as what
who is that
hi Jiminy_Cricket
I was just pretending that he could talk
that one's okay
that's a good place to put the bird
where do birds fly
uhhuh
right
where do flowers grow
how come
uhhuh that's where they get the best fertilizer
breaking it
peeling it
like a banana
let's see
he's the farmer
what do farmers grow in their gardens
uhhuh that's a carrot
okay that's a good idea
do you want to do this one
okay let's see if we can find that page
here it is
because she's a girl
and girls are always queens
if you're a boy you have_to be a king
right
why of_course
the king
we'll have_to look at the picture before we can decide
okay what's he holding
oh come on what is it
uhhuh or an oar
a oar
it can be an oar or a paddle
no it'll work
that looks like Doc in the Seven Dwarfs
he has old glasses on
and so everybody called him Doc
how can you tell he's fat
people who are fat have beards
or do you think that he looks fat because he has big cheeks
what
do you think so
well you shouldn't tell her that
because it might make her feel sad
I know
I'm glad you're telling me instead of her
hurry
before it dries
no that was fast as the lightening
how come
he lost a finger
uhhuh we don't have_to call him a loser
we could just tell him that he made a booboo
oh
I think we've done enough for one night
Simple_Simon
what
yeah put it right here
you didn't
you thought I was a monster
did you eat all your toast so we could work on it
okay are you through with your yogurt
which one do you think he is
Sneezy
he looks like Sneezy
okay first of all we have_to clear off the table
so we'll have a place to do it
green
just a second I'll help you
you don't
what are you going to try to do
don't rip them up
because then we'll have_to get tape and tape them down
the little lines are under there
the little lines are under there
do you want me to help
with that pie
okay
well that's okay
your hands will grow
and the rest of your body will grow
then you'll die
would you be able to find clothes to wear
oh
I love you Abe
I know
what do you mean when you say
come on
because sometimes I say
come on let's be friends
so you say
come on I love you
oh
you haven't
I could use that net when we go canoeing
that sounds like a really good idea
okay
no it comes tomorrow on Sunday
what
a Kleenex
to blot it
why are you going to use a Kleenex
uhhuh I think that you've blotted it enough
no
oh
last night
I think that you're leaving them in the water too long
and all the glue's coming off
don't leave it in the water so long okay
okay but don't leave the stickers in the water so long and we won't need to tape them okay
no I think that's enough see
it stayed on
uhhuh
no that doesn't need to be blotted
it doesn't have any excess water does it
uhhuh
look and see
that's right
why
probably because you forgot to do something
you tell me
no what about putting it in the bowl
can't do what
those are for another page
those stickers are for another page
we do one page at a time
right here see
that's a hard one
what about these
it can go anywhere you want
sure
uhhuh
uhhuh
what kind of pies do you like to eat Abe
you like cakes better than pies
okay what do you think Mickey_Mouse is doing
I heard you
who did you sound like
I thought you sounded like Ernie
remember when we were in Pennsylvania and we played in a haystack
who's doing that
oh
who said that
for your paddle
nope they were all out
but they said we could come back another time
one what
yeah
uhhuh
some do
I think that one's called a ram
and make your paddle
we have_to wait until the wood comes in okay
billygoats don't have that much fur on them
are you getting tired
this will be the last page okay
this is hard work isn't it
uhhuh
I'd say
Abe what are you doing
and I'd say
you must be having a hard time going to sleep
what else did Ernie count
what happened then
the whole neighborhood
what do you say
okay
let's find the dotted lines
that's right
is that even on the right page
I think you're being silly
of course
as_soon_as you finish these stickers
you still have a few more to put on
oh sure
I am
why
I got up when you got up
I wasn't ready to get up
what does it look like
no the cows are eating the corn
uhhuh
he's not going to be mean
he'll just say
come on come on let's go eat somewhere else
there are several more
let's see how many
here's one that we need to do
hm
what
oh were they friendly or mean
we need to do five
yeah we'll do that one next time
how many did you do Abe
how many pages did you do
okay
oh man why did you wake me up
I'm going to teach you how to fix your own toast
when you get to be about six
or seven
no you'll learn how to do it before then I hope
I think you did
hey you're too rough
that wasn't my knee
okay know what Abe and I are going to do
we're going to get a big piece of paper
and Abe can lie on it
and we'll draw an outline of his body
sounds like a good idea to me
Abe Daddy can throw you up on the ceiling
so you can stick on the big piece of paper
and I could get a marker and mark around you
why not
what will I say
yeah
I'm looking
gee I don't see it anywhere do you
