the end
that's pretty good Naima
his tree and Kanga says it's her tree
which doesn't make any sense said Pooh
because Kanga doesn't live in a tree
he had just come to the bridge
and he was not looking where he was going
well he was supposed to be going over a bridge I think but he was not looking where he was going
don't know actually
then he tripped over something and the fir cone jerked out of his paw into the river
he tripped over something
I don't think we know
bother said Pooh as it floated under the bridge
he looked at the river as it slipped slowly away beneath him
and suddenly there was his fir cone slipping away too
that's funny said Pooh
I dropped it on the other side and it came out on this side
I wonder if it would do it again
and he went back for more fir cones
it did
it kept on doing it
then he dropped two in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first
and one of them did
but as they were both the same size Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win or the other one
so the next time he dropped in one big one and one little one
the big one came out first
which is what he had said it would do
and the little one came out last which was what he had said it would do
so he had won twice
and when he went home for tea he had won thirty six and lost twenty eight
which meant that he was
well
I guess twenty eight times he got it wrong and thirty six times he got it right
which meant that he was
well you take twenty eight from thirty six and that's what he was
instead of the other way around
that's the end of that story
