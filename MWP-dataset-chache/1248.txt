xxx are you giving me a present
oh are you showing me something
yes
I see that
presents to plant
that's a nice kind of present
thank you
it's alright with me if you want to take the seeds out of that seed packet and put them in envelopes
that would be fine
while I'm sorting these seeds
today is Sunday
April
eight
you can do that if you want and put them in here if you feel like it
or just put them in here
did we say what was the date today
do you remember
was it the seventeenth or the eighteenth
because you looked at it on the calendar and so did I
the different color
yeah bean seeds are not all the same color
okay signet marigold
it's okay you can pick them up
those are big seeds
they're easy to find
sow indoors
lightly cover seed
harden often
okay
we will plant some of these and those today too
fever fuel
xxx xxx
the ones that you have
right there those brown ones
you can take them
xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx
you can do that
you well we can plant them when it's time to plant them
you know those zinnias that we planted last year never came up
here's the package of seeds from the zinnias
that was kind of disappointing
what was funny
that they never came up
I know
sow seeds outdoors in early spring
maybe we should
I think we might need to go to the garden store to get some flats to put our seedlings in
we have some containers but we don't
whoopsie
we don't quite have enough
this is parsley
direct sunlight
this is Nasturtiums
and basically empty
carrots
yeah I think you're right
uh
I know
best grown as a xxx xxx crop
plant in mid June
I don't think so
I don't know why the carrots didn't come up
I've always had trouble growing carrots
I don't know if it's because of the soil
it's not the right kind of soil or what
these need to be planted in June
or July
what does it look like
does it look the same
it doesn't look any different at all
aw
oh dear
oh Calendula
right here
orange zinger
those never came up either
they
actually we got plants but they didn't bloom
that's what happened
direct seed after last frost
okay it goes in that category
and this is the chard
blooms during mid spring
to mid summer
the Calendula
well the
zinnias never came up
there are two kinds of chard this year
xxx xxx
after all danger of frosts has past
yes Naima
does it look the same
what does it look like
hm
nah
can you put these things in the garbage for me
those that's garbage there
and this too
sorry there was more
xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
okay here's all the different categories of seeds
these things we have_to wait until we have our garden built
actually that has gotta go elsewhere
okay
xxx there
and this has gotta go
direct seed after last frost
you have two kinds of bean seeds is that right
well that's what
that's all I'm gonna give you right now because we're getting ready
let's see after last frost
to go investigate the problem with the grow core
or maybe to go to the garden store
plant outdoors today
because we need some flats to sow seeds in
okay
xxx xxx xxx xxx
let's go look at that soil and see what the problem is
oh brother
oh not only is it looking
not different
I'm gonna take this
out
I think
possibly
it's not fluffing up
yeah
I don't know let's sit here a while longer
I do not know why this is happening
but I think maybe we shouldn't have put the stuff on top of it to weight it down
let's leave it like this
I'm gonna leave it here a while longer
now I think
I'm gonna go to the garden store and get some flats
to grow things in
no no
I want you to leave it right there
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah xxx
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
are you hungry
you know you didn't have a second breakfast yet
