the toy book
okay
I gotta see where it is
is it called Sophie in toy+land
are you sure
let's see if there's another toy one
who read that one to you
nobody you just saw it
okay let's see hey the frog prince
that reminds xxx of something else we just saw called what
right
this one
Sophie in toy+land look at this book is coming apart
Sophie was very sad she couldn't find Peter the panda anywhere
he was her favorite toy and she took him to bed every night
it was almost bedtime and Sophie didn't know how she'd get to sleep without him
Sophie sat on Beauty her rocking+horse and rocked sadly back and forth
hey you have a rocking+horse like that
what's yours called
as her eyes filled with tears something she didn't know what made her rock faster than ever before she closed her eyes there was a tremendous whistling in her ears
the next minute she was tumbling head over heels through the air then floating gently down to land on something soft
Sophie blinked her eyes
where was she exactly
hello Sophie growled a voice from above her head she opened her eyes and looked up
the legs of a bed her bed towered above her it must have grown
peaking over the edge of her quilt was big Ted next to him was little Ted
see them
hello Sophie squeaked little Ted
her teddy bears were talking she looked around she was tiny
help she gulped I'm tiny I've shrunk her eyes filled with tears
hello Sophie welcome to toy+land called a voice from across the room
it was Samantha Sophie's doll
can you point to where you think Samantha Sophie's doll is
right
you're as tall as I am gasped Sophie
I'm no bigger than my own doll what's going on
don't cry said Samantha gently you're in toy+land that's all
we're all little here you'll grow big when Beauty takes you home again
Sophie turned her head
Beauty now tiny just like her was on the floor beside her
how come Beauty got small too
because
xxx let's let Violet answer
even the toy shrank
in toy+land
no it's because that's a big toy
look out below cried big Ted we're coming down squeaked little Ted
big Ted tied one end of a cord to the bed and dropped the other end to the floor it was the sash of Sophie's bathrobe the bears climbed down it
let's call the other toys suggested Samantha wake up everybody she cried
suddenly all of Sophie's toys sprang to life
Sophie's tiniest dolls dashed out of the dollhouse and the toys that had been put into the toy+box jumped down from it
let's play suggested big Ted
this is fun said Sophie
as she played games with her toys would you like to do that Violet
oh yeah
is that how she's gonna get her panda
where's
oh yeah I don't know
where's Peter asked Sophie suddenly
they looked everywhere but Peter the panda was no where to be found
they gazed at each other in dismay then Sophie heard a soft noise
everyone stood still and listened
someone's calling said the fairy doll who had very good hearing
it's coming from the top of the bookcase said Sophie
they crowded beneath the bookcase a tiny black and white head appeared over the top high above them it was Peter the panda
I'm stuck he squeaked in a tiny voice
gosh said Sophie I must have put you there when I was told to straighten up my room
please get me down begged Peter the panda but how asked Sophie
the bookcase is so high and we're so little
what can they do Violet
you know what I think they should do
I think she should go back on her horse and get big again and then she can just walk right over to it and pick it up right
I know a way said big Ted he ran off and came back pushing Sophie's toy fire engine we can use this what a good idea
it stretched higher and higher into the air just the way a real fire engine's ladder does until the very top of it was resting against the bookcase
now climb down Peter shouted Samantha
oh no I can't said Peter don't worry said big Ted I'll get him down
he climbed up the ladder and lifted Peter onto his shoulders
everybody cheered and clapped when big Ted carried Peter safely to the ground
thank you said Sophie hugging big Ted and kissing his cheek
just then the clock on the bedroom wall went cuckoo
uhoh said Sophie it's time for bed I have_to go
bye bye toys thank you
goodbye shouted the toys
please come again
Sophie climbed onto the back of the magic rocking horse and began to rock
in an instant she was back in her bedroom a big girl again
big Ted and little Ted were slumped at the foot of the bed
the fire+engine with Samantha the doll leaning against it was down on the floor
the rest of the toys were all back in their normal places
it seemed as though Sophie's adventure in toy+land never happened
the sash of her bathrobe was still dangling down the side of the bed and Peter the panda was lying safe on Sophie's pillow
lucky Sophie had been to toy+land she had a delightful adventure with all her toys and she had found Peter and panda too
now she couldn't wait to go to bed
Peter and panda xxx
Peter the panda
she couldn't wait to go to bed and dream about her wonderful adventure
hey I think it was a dream do you
do you think it was a dream xxx
and she woke up and she had her she had her bear with her
Max do you want me to get the Legos out for you to play for a little while
xxx maybe it's just a xxx
because I wanted to do a puzzle with Violet Violet you wanna do the dinosaur floor puzzle with me while Max does his Legos for a few minutes
unicorn one
okay
the spring unicorn
okay then that's it because these are long ones
okay
far away beyond the widest oceans lies the enchanted land of Feria
the people of Feria are always happy for the summers are long the falls are beautiful the springs are a joy and the winters although a little cold are short
it is such a beautiful place and the crops grow so well that there is little for the Ferian people to do but enjoy themselves in the sun
so they rarely work and instead spend their days playing having parties making music and telling each other wonderful stories
hey I wanna go there do you
what are xxx
mhm
some people might say that they are lazy but they wouldn't care because they're just so happy
but one year it wasn't like that
that year in fact the people of Feria were far from happy indeed they were very worried
for although spring should have arrived weeks before it hadn't none of the winter snows were gone yet
and lakes had not thawed the birds were not building their nests and the buds of the flowers in the mountain meadows had had failed to open
not good enough said the king something must be done
which one you think's the king Violet
let Violet choose please Maxwell
which one do you think Violet
the same as he said
I was gonna guess that guy
because you know why
he looks older and he was the one talking but then when Max pointed to that one I think he's right because that one has the crown on
right
but it's funny the king's usually old isn't he
all the men and women of great council except for one shook their heads for they did not know the answer but the oldest and wisest member stood up
it is because the spring unicorn the bringer of spring has not visited Feria this year he explained without his arrival there can be no spring
the king and the other members of the council looked at each other and frowned but why has the spring unicorn not come to Feria asked the king
doesn't he like us anymore
I think it could be because we are so busy enjoying ourselves that we never thank the spring unicorn for all he does for us it could be that he thinks we are lazy and don't deserve to live in such a wonderful place suggested the wisest council member
but we must pay that put that right at once said the king all the people in the land must leave the warmth of their homes and go out and start work immediately
they must start um they must um
the king wanted to describe the sorts of things that people should be doing when they went out to work but the trouble was he knew nothing about work so he didn't know what to say
finally he said they er they must you know they must bustle about being busy doing work and things
do you know what a work thing is Violet
sweeping is one kind of work do you know any other kind of work
in the winter yeah that's a type of work in the winter
digging too yep so because the king told them to the people of Feria went to work at first they didn't even know what to do
then when they looked up the word in the Feria dictionary and they found out what was involved they didn't like the sound of it and grumbled a lot among themselves
but as time passed they discovered that they actually enjoyed being busy they shoveled the snow from the paths in their gardens they cleared snow from the roads
they repaired leaking roofs and they even filled all the holes in the road
and they still laughed and sang the way they used to before the spring failed to arrive and the king ordered them all to go to work
but it still kept snowing and the lakes didn't thaw and the birds failed to build their nests and the flowers didn't bloom
what can be the matter now the king asked the oldest and wisest member of his council
perhaps the spring unicorn doesn't know how hard we are working said the wise man
well the spring unicorn must be told snapped the king stamping his royal feet
that very day messengers were sent throughout the land to put up posters announcing that anyone who found the spring unicorn and explained how hard the Ferians had been working would receive all the gold they could wish for
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived
do you know where he lives Violet
and where's that
what do you call that place you think
he lives in the same place
how come they couldn't find him then
oh they didn't see him
he lives in the valley
the problem was that nobody knew where the spring unicorn lived
nobody that was except for a poor musician who was known as the Whistler
I'm fed up with winter and I've got nothing to better to do so I might just as well go and look for the spring unicorn thought the Whistler
see him here
so he picked up his flute and set off in search of the spring unicorn he traveled far and wide playing his flute to keep him cheerful on his journey
and as he played the notes of the flute danced before him leading him on and on across the widest ocean over the highest mountains
I shall follow the notes of my music wherever they lead me he told himself at long last he came to a valley
hey Max you're right
where no one had ever been before it was the home of the spring unicorn you have no place here boomed a loud voice how how did you a mere Ferian find your way here
I played my flute and followed the notes explained the Whistler
then he demonstrated with a quick tune
his music was so beautiful that within minutes a whole herd of magical unicorns appeared and danced before him
when he had finally laid down his flute one of the unicorns trotted forward he introduced himself as the spring unicorn
why are you here the spring unicorn asked
because you failed to come to Feria this year
ha exclaimed the spring unicorn I couldn't be bothered to come because the people of Feria are so lazy they do not deserve my beautiful springs
but what you say is no longer true why not Violet
are the people lazy there
why not
now they are right
we are no longer lazy and we still have time to be happy telling each other wonderful tales and playing beautiful music
maybe you are right said the spring unicorn when the tune had come to an end I'll tell you what I'll do
providing you play your beautiful music on your journey back to Feria I shall accompany you
and we shall see if the people are no longer lazy
can I fly on your back asked the Whistler hopefully
no said the spring unicorn if we fly the journey will be over too quickly and I won't have time to listen to all that music I want you to play
we shall walk back the way you came
oh drat thought the Whistler but how do they walk across the ocean
xxx the Whistler returned the way he had come and through his journey he played the most beautiful music
that the spring unicorn followed every step of the way
eventually they arrived in the mountains above Feria look
see them up there
the Whistler pointing down at the village see how hard the people are working
indeed they were some were shoveling snow from their gardens but as soon as they had finished more snow fell to replace it
some were clearing snow from the roads
some were fixing leaks but as soon as they finished more snow fell
indeed they are working but are they happy in their work
listen sad the Whistler
the unicorn listened
faintly from the village came the sound of someone laughing someone else was whistling
someone else was singing
oh yes said the Whistler I think you can say they are happy
I believe you are right you shall have your spring back again
I shall continue to bring a new spring year after year just as long as the people remain happy and contented and do not ever become lazy again
and that's how it was and that's how it still is
and the Whistler well he turned down the king's offer of riches in favor of becoming the spring unicorn's helper
which is why every year the Ferian spring is always heralded by the most beautiful music anyone has ever heard
