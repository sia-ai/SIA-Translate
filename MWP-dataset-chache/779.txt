what else happened at school
you don't know
there were some fish there
in an aquarium
you went to the store today when you were at school

it was about five weeks ago
did you put it in your pocket
do you know what kind of fish you have at school
what kind are they
goldfish

what do you call them
okay
okay
well what do you say
you weren't kidding
to tell the truth I don't know why
do you think he poops in his pants
yeah you're big boys aren't you
do you think that would make him sad if you called him a baby
what
okay
yeah
you don't
with your pencil
what did you say when she said that
what did she say
did she explain why you shouldn't run with a small pencil
what
what would you do with his fur
oh what do you think the hawk would say
what do you think
you don't think they're very nice
what would they do if they caught you
what would they do if they caught you
oh they just let them run around
they have what
oh does that help them swim
oh Daddy

guess what kind of feet hawks have
big pointed feet with seventeen toes
three
you would
really
I'll see you in a little while

hey don't throw it at the plants
you might hurt them
you can't hear them
but they might
are you sure
uhhuh there you go
you did it that time
that's pretty clever
you know what
how
oh
okay
yeah
doesn't that hurt them when you do that
yeah but doesn't it hurt the hawks when you cut their fur off
can't you hurt if you don't have blood
so if I cut a hawk's head off it wouldn't hurt him
but if I cut his head off would that hurt him
how come
bark
wow
there's a whole lot of types of hawks aren't there
what type is that
honey hawk brontosaurus dinosaur

I said maybe Daddy can make us one
he's good at that
bring me a piece of paper
I'll see if I can help you
we'll see
okay tell me what it looks like
real flat wings huh
did it have a point on the front
that's going to be hard to do
let's see
are you cold Abe
where
yeah you can have it
fruit is so good for you
beside that it tastes good
why is what made out_of mice traps
oh because people use mice traps to get mice
because mice are a little nuisance
why
all by himself
here you go
is it
okay do you want to see if it works
we can try in here watch
okay
so it would look like an airplane
it is an airplane
come here let me show you how to hold it
that was a good one Abe
that one does doesn't it
wow
what
do it again
I'm going to watch this time
woo
I'm watching
yeah it's in good shape
okay pretty clever
did you see the decorations Daddy drew on it
watch this Abe
watch
just hold it right here and throw it
sure you can have it
uhhuh
stand in your chair and do it
yeah
it doesn't matter
what does that remind you of Abe
oh
both of them at the same time
I'm watching Abe
you didn't tell me you were about to throw them either
the airplane landed in the barn
okay here let me fix this
and then it'll be really neat
while Daddy's fixing that why don't you tell him what you did to your hat at Danny's house today
and what happened to it
where
on the awning of the porch
you threw it that high
a hockey stick and Mommy got it down
okay here you go
okay wow
do you want me to do them at the same time
okay
it sure is
I'm trying to figure out how to do it whoa
it sure is
that's a helicopter
a whirlybird
okay
watch this Abe
how come
too short for what
oh your way's just as good
I don't reach the ceiling all the time either see
how come
you jumped over to the chair from the footstool
okay
you are really tricky
why
because it goes around when it come down
what
oh you have your telescope
when they don't have bathtubs
I didn't know that
where did you see that
they didn't have bathtubs
they were looking for all the clues weren't they
they wanted to find out who stole the bathtub
so they followed the clues
and they found out who stole the bathtub
right
the gorilla took the bathtub
it looks upset to me
how many faces does he have Abe
scratched off
maybe you're just covering them up and hiding them
you have how many faces
really
when you cry do you have the same face as you laugh
I think we're gonna go to K_Mart
don't you want to help us find a baseball mitt
right
but we decided that we'd get one mitt if it didn't cost a_lot_of money
I don't have very much
maybe we can use your pennies
it is
that's strange
I don't see it
what
oh
how come
I don't know why
why do dinosaurs have brains
why do they
they're born with them
I was just teasing
I was the one who got you those pennies anyway
no you're telling me a story
it's hurting
oh
K_Mart is the correct pronunciation
you have another splinter in your hand
right here
forgot what
you want me to
hold still
I want to get this splinter out
so it doesn't get infected
a_lot_of bad germs come and stay in your sore
today
as_soon_as we get back home you can play out some more okay
we're just going to K_Mart for a few minutes
you wanna do everything we don't want to do
it's just part of the suitcase
how come
knock knock who's there
did you play with them
did you bury him in the sand
get your sweatshirt
uhhuh the wind's blowing
how
that would protect your back not your tummy
you have_to wear something else
did you bring your gun back in
come here
and I'll tell you why
come here
and I'll tell you
I'm not going
I'm staying
hey there's a bird at our feeder
you'll have_to put a jacket on

okay why don't you go out and feel how cold it is
and then come back and tell me
are you sure
if you wanna go put your blue jacket on okay

it was the card you saw that you liked so much
uhhuh
that looks like a fun game
stay here late
how come
do you get tired of seeing me around the house
okay just for that I'll stay late
we could play cards while Mommy was here
I'm just gonna sit up here for a minute
go ahead and straighten it
I don't think we need to tape it
okay
you are
let me look at it
good deal Abe
I'm gonna come down and sit with you
maybe later
okay
good I'm glad you didn't forget
goodbye
I think she's going to take her bike

some of your trucks are what
okay I think it's time to pick up your cards
okay
yeah I'm done playing

let me try and make one like you want
what happened at school today
how come you don't know
nothing at all
how boring
it means that's how it is when nothing happens
let's see what happened today
you're right
why do you think it flew away
so fast you couldn't hear it
if he had a loud voice why couldn't you hear him
he was too loud
what does that mean
I think so isn't it
well let's see if this works
you unstapled it
thanks it's a really nice ring
let's try this airplane
okay
thanks is this how you throw it
okay
sure
where
okay
nothing it's just some junk watch this airplane

I never have either
I think that's why it doesn't work
go put the ones up that you're not going to read okay
I'm gonna do dishes
so you put up the books
is that why you came in
is that why you came in
why'd you come in
I put it in your barn with your other animals
you had it right the first time there
Abe did you tell anybody at school today about going camping
what
did you tell anybody
huh
I don't think so
off the play one they did
either you or Greggy or Andy or Leslie picked them off the plastic one Abe
then it must have been Greggy or Andy or Leslie
a what
Abe I was already a tiny seed once
are you going to be a tiny seed again
do they grow little first
do old people grow little
or do they just turn into seeds
oh Abe people don't turn back into seeds
no they don't
why don't you tell me what happened when we went camping yesterday
okay you tell me what you remember
and then I'll tell you what I remember
okay first of all we drove out into the country
do you remember where we drove
what did we do when we got there
that's right
all those were different ways to get down until you found a dirt path
then what did we do
we climbed down the path
and we crossed the road
and then what
uhhuh what did we do there
on the way home
oh flies
some more flies
he didn't have any eyes did he
I don't know
what did he have
what did we do before we saw the fish
that's right
but what did we do right after we crossed the road from the cliffs and got back to our car
okay when did we see the fish
that's right
and what did we do right before we went to the river
what did you use the twigs for
right
uhhuh you didn't eat very much of your hot dog
do you want to go camping again
do you mean tomorrow morning
well I don't think we can go tomorrow
I think we can go next week
how come Sunday
we don't want to go on a yucky day
why
oh I'm not sure I wanna go where the dumptrucks go
yep how come you're sweating
the chalk melted
Abe how'd you like to ride your bike to the park

no you didn't stay overnight
what
the camping book

turn your flashlight off before you put it in your pocket
who
you're a teaser
what are you doing you weirdo
whoa you had a wreck
almost
be careful
you could hit the glove
I'm just looking at the map
I'll be the pitcher
and you could be the batter
how come
you do
I didn't know that
you're probably right
I have a good solution
how about putting on your swimming suit and taking a nice cool bath
what would you like
hot chocolate is a winter drink Abe
uhuh
I think five cookies is too much
yeah we should have taken it last time
I don't think you can eat five
here's three
correct Abe
how many big ones
uhhuh one big one and two middle ones and two little ones
I'm not
in your hair
what would you like to drink Abe
milk
okay
do you want cheese
lettuce
just a piece of lettuce
would you like a little bit more meat
how do they taste
okay
okay
Abe how did you get that balloon
oh did anything else exciting happen at school
huh
I know
what would you do if a hawk came to school to pick you up
what'd everybody else say
they'd say
what is that
it's a onion
I don't care to
Daddy likes them though
sure thank_you pardner
what color is the taco meat
after it's cooked
before we cook it it's red
what are those
remember when we grew tomatoes in our garden Abe
uhhuh last summer
did you ever eat any of them
they were good weren't they
I thought they were good
am I a hawk
what
good I'm glad it all worked out okay
I did
it was pretty good
here's your big spoon
here
okay
I sure did
I like onions
they must have bad breath
oh
thank_you
that's right
what
what
what is it
oh how nice wow
no that's part of a red pepper
Abe why does that balloon float in the air
why does helium float
what's the difference between helium and the plain air you blow in a balloon
who tied it
why did she tie it to your wrist
oh
that's right
hey that was pretty fast
I don't know
did you find the outside
Abe if I filled you up with helium
would you float away
I won't
did you tell Daddy we walked down to Amara's house this morning
Abe drove his truck down
oh
good idea
when we go camping we'll look for some bears
you did
did you find any bears
if you took it
where are you going to take it
then nothing will happen
okay see if you can reach it now
yeah that's one way
are you ready to go camping
not in the morning
we'll probably go in the afternoon okay
okay now you see if you can touch it
let's see whoops
it's stuck on the ceiling
what
okay
no just scoot the chair over
I think that would do it
okay
just let it go
wish me luck
to class I have_to take a test
hey that looks pretty dangerous to me
yeah go ahead and put your highchair back
right here
what do you want
okay I'll get you some milk now
okay here's your milk
goodbye Mom
what
do you want to
Abe
what are you going to tell everybody at school tomorrow
how come
come here for just a second
what are you looking for
if you want to you can read that to Daddy
just tell him
really
that looks like a nightmare alright
remember what I told you
tell me what you remember
nightmares are just bad dreams is that real
it's his imagination isn't it
look at this
give it to Mom
Abe I wanna ask you something
okay
did you tell Daddy what we saw sitting inside the library
Abe not all nightmares are the same thing
Abe aren't you going to tell people about going camping
do you think it's a new one or part of an old one
Abe do you remember what happened when we went camping
huh
how come
because why
for what reason
because they didn't get to go camping
your friends at school
I don't even have a real cannon
hm
no I don't even think I've ever seen a toy cannon
if that's what you dream about
that little boy's nightmares do
I've never had nightmares like that
do you know why
he was sleepy
so the little boy let him get in bed with him
there's clay on the outside
I'm oiling this chair
sure
sure let me show you where to put it
right
that's already used
hey Abe don't mess with the stuff on my desk
you can't mess with stuff on Daddy's desk
okay if you want to sit in the corner go ahead
Abe do you still have that shell that you found
oh that's right
I remember now
I think it would get bumped a_lot over there
because you're such a bumpy boy
okay
hey there's ants in here
what did you say
where at
oh
here
yeah it's real sharp
it is
let me see your finger
