I'm a bad Dad
he had this idea about a little bit of pee and he said
now tell me the story about what happened to Louis Pasteur Ross
this was something that he just finished telling me downstairs when I didn't have a taperecorder
go ahead
what was the germ
what was the germ
and what did it do
and didn't have rabies any more
and what were the names of the germs
rabies
and what were the names of the army
the army that went in
mister Pasteur's army
what was it called
yeah
what was the name of his army
and they were all part of the injection
was it a serum or an injection
right
an injection of a needle in the arm
and where was the army
was it in the needle
and it went into the boy's body
and what did it do in the boy's body
it won against the bad rabies
wonderful Ross
good job
would you like to go upstairs now
do you want to do letters down here or up there
okay
if Marky doesn't come okay
don't close the door
I'll put these over here
put the letters you know in front of you
Ross what do you mean you can find bad guys and send them to jail and even us
what do you mean even us
we're going to go to jail too
what do you mean Honey
what did you mean
oh you mean that even Marky and Daddy can send them to jail
so what you mean is
and you guys can too
well what does the Super Robot do
and for the good of the Empire
no for the good of the Rebellion honey
not the bad old Empire
underoos
he put on his underoos he didn't put on his cape
why would you be those things
and
yeah it's Jose Cariocca
go ahead
right
didn't know
I thought he said
I can do it I can do it
okay
I'll bet they were rabies weren't they
good
did he get well Ross
and is that the end of the story
and then everybody said thank_you to Louis Pasteur didn't they
cause he had figured out how to stop people from getting rabies
yeah
good
no Ross
you have two Supermen that are the same
what's her name
everybody should kiss Mommy
say the nice word
what was that
in there in the bed+room
no
I'm not going to fall for that being wrapped around your finger
there are several types of weapons guns snakes blasters
what other kinds of weapons are there Ross
sticks freezing chambers
and they all are types of weapons
they are things that do bad things to people
right
you better eat
I'd better eat
I think it's very very very good
why not
well why
not true
it tastes like caterpillars
like caterpillars
see all those caterpillars crawling around
caterpillars taste yummy
no
why not
you're not eating them
why not
Marky will eat them
and I asked Ross
who wants apple juice
and Mommy
what he means is that Mommy is already drinking beer
so it is an incorrect use of the present instead of the progressive
golf head
and then did Billy cry
did he think it was funny
what did he do
was he mad
was golf head a bad word
and then did Billy go with his dad
did he feel like his dad was angry
really
why did his Daddy call him a golf head
what does the dad do to him
what does the dad do to him
he does
like what
really
nose head
maybe that's because he has a nose on his head
he does
and does the daddy spank the little boy
no
does the daddy daddy ever give him kisses
I love spanking
does Billy's daddy ever kiss him
so all the things that he does is he just uses bad words
well that is pretty bad wouldn't you say Mom
does your Daddy ever use bad words
do I ever call you anything bad
one word
there's one word I use
it's a little bit bad
what is it do you think
no I never use that
that's not a name
spanking's not a name
name
spanking's something you do
there's a name
that's a little bit bad
that sometimes I call you
yeah
what do think about that name
pretty funny
is it a good name or a bad name
is it as bad as golf head
it's gooder
right right
superman
but Superman never loses
and then what
and if you're on the other side
well closer to the napkin and farther from the napkin
there are two positions there
right
so the guy that's farther from the napkin wins or loses
who was that
very good
that's exactly right
very good
if you have two of them what do you have
then you have storm troopers
or storm trooper people
that's a storm trooper person
there's just one
there's just one so he's a storm trooper
with a s on the end
because there's just one
right
Ross is this a tape recorder or is it a tape recorders
