saber tooth tiger and do you remember what's the thing that we saw that has a big sort of wide fork shaped horn on the front of his head

it's in your prehistoric book
mm it kinda looks like a hippo with a big fork on its head
fork horn
that's right a Brontotherium very good sweetie
did we see anything else when we were there
oh we saw a giant sloth you're right
and
mm
we saw a lotta dinosaurs huh
Styracosaurus

right
and then there was the baby one too
and there was a meat eater also
a Carnotaur
mhm

really
alright
excellent
okay should I read this
Snuffy's favorite color
okay
concert day at Terrytown had been a big success
everyone sand a song about his or her favorite color
but Snuffy couldn't decide what his favorite color was so he sang a song about all the colors
concert day was supersonic said Jay Jay as he flew up next to Snuffy
your rainbow song was the best part of the show
you must be feeling pretty good
I am said Snuffy but everyone else picked a favorite color to sing about and I couldn't figure out my favorite color
choosing a favorite color is one of the hardest things I'd ever tried to do
hey Snuffy said Jay Jay I have an idea when I have trouble figuring something out I go see Brenda Blue
that's a great idea thanks Jay Jay called Snuffy
he headed toward Terrytown airport and Brenda Blue's workshop
when Snuffy arrived at the workshop he found Brenda Blue working on a small motor
hi Brenda said Snuffy hi Snuffy what's wrong asked Brenda
I can't decide on a favorite color said Snuffy
well it seems to me if something is your favorite color you probably see it a lot right asked Brenda
yes said Snuffy I would probably see it every day
and if something is your favorite you probably like it a lot too right asked Brenda
yes said Snuffy if it's my favorite I'd really love it
so you should figure out your favorite color based on the things you see today explained Brenda
and pay special attention to what you love the most
what a super idea thanks Brenda exclaimed Snuffy as he flew up into the sky
mm
neat
how's that water
mm
oh what's that
the sun what's it doing
rising you're right
that's exactly what it's doing
Snuffy was ready to put his plan into action so he looked at the things around him
mm the sun above me is yellow
maybe yellow should be my favorite color he said
but my sky writing smoke is white and so are the clouds so maybe white should be my favorite color
hey Snuffy called Jay Jay how's it going
I'm still trying to choose my favorite color replied Snuffy
wanna join me for some crock water he asked Jay Jay
that would be great answered Snuffy
let's go fill up our water tanks suggested Jay Jay
there you go guys said Brenda Blue your water tanks are filled to the brim
thanks Brenda cheered Jay Jay I don't know what we'd do without you
you're the best agreed Snuffy come on Snuffy we have work to do said Jay Jay
and they taxied down the runway
Jay Jay and Snuffy arrived at farmer Dale's field
as they sprayed water on the crops Snuffy was thinking about what his favorite color might be
mm parts of the field are brown so maybe brown should be my favorite color
and the corn stalks are green so maybe green should be my favorite color
but when the corn is picked it's yellow just like the sun that's two votes for yellow so maybe that should be my favorite color
okay Snuffy said Jay Jay we have a lot of deliveries to make we'd better head back to Terrytown airport to refuel
back at Terrytown airport Brenda Blue filled up their gas tanks
you guys are refueled and ready to make your deliveries she said
thanks Brenda called Jay Jay and Snuffy as they left the airport
boy that Brenda Blue sure is a big help said Snuffy
no kidding agreed Jay Jay she takes good care of us
ooh look at that
what's that
yeah do you know what the building is called
that's a barn
right
remember you have that book called big red barn
yeah
sure we'll look and see if we have it we'll read it okay
when you were a little tiny lil tiny teeny tiny girl you used to read that book all the time and you could read that book to me
mhm
well but you memorized the whole book because I used to read it to you all the time and you would every time I would turn the page you would read the book
you would recite it
I don't know if you remember it now we'll havta look for it
while yes
oh
oh okay
maybe I'll read it once and then you can read it once
because then you'll probably remember it
oh alright
while he was flying Snuffy thought to himself I love making deliveries so what colors do I see when I'm making them
that big barn near the river is red
maybe red should be my favorite color
and the flowers of Smiley Meadow are purple and orange
maybe one of those should be my favorite color
the deliveries took them over the docks of Terrytown and Snuffy looked again for his favorite color
wow look at those boats one's pink one's black another is gold
maybe one of those colors is my favorite
what are you thinking about Snuffy asked Jay Jay
I'm still trying to figure out my favorite color
well maybe you'll get lucky and it will come to like a flash of lightning said Jay Jay
just then there was a flash of light and a rumbling sound in the sky
whada you think that sound is
thunder
that doesn't sound good said Jay Jay
the sky filled with clouds and the rain began to fall
we better go home said Snuffy
as Snuffy and Jay Jay flew back to Terrytown airport they got all wet but they knew when they arrived Brenda Blue would be waiting with a dry towel
how are you feeling Snuffy asked Brenda as she finished drying him off
I feel great replied Snuffy thanks
good I wouldn't want you to get rusty she said
okay Jay Jay it's your turn
Snuffy moved to the hanger door and noticed a rainbow he remembered he hadn't picked a favorite color
Brenda said I should think of something I love and that might help me choose
and Brenda's always right thought Snuffy
in fact Brenda's one of the most helpful people I know
she fills our water tanks when they're empty she refuels us when we're out of gas she dries us off when we get wet and much more
I sure do love Brenda a lot
hey that's it said Snuffy I just figured out my favorite color
that's great Snuffy said Jay Jay what is it not what said Snuffy who
Blue Brenda Blue
