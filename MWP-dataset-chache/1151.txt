one day Mister and Misses Brown were standing in Paddington station
they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school
suddenly Mr Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags
look over there he said to Mrs Brown
I'm sure I saw a
a bear
a bear said Mrs Brown
in Paddington station
don't be silly Henry there can't be
xxx this is Stephanie Stephanie this is xxx by the way
hi
hi
nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
but there it was it had a funny kind of hat and was sitting all by itself in an old suitcase near the lost property office
as they drew near the bear stood up and politely drew raised it's hat
good afternoon it said in a small clear voice
can I help you
we were wondering if we could help you said Mrs Brown
where ever have you come from
the bear looked around carefully before replying
darkest Peru
I stowed away and lived on Marmalade
Mrs Brown spired a label around the bear's neck
it said simply please look after this bear
thank you
aunt Lucy
Henry she exclaimed we shall have_to take him home with us
but we don't even know his name began Mr Brown
we'll call him
Paddington said Mrs Brown
because that's where we
found him
Mrs Brown went off to look Judy and Mr Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat
he left Paddington sitting at a table in the corner near the window
and he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of tea and a large plate piled high with
sticky cakes
after his long journey Paddington felt so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink
I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mr Brown he announced
and without waiting for a reply he climbed up on to the table
Mr Brown steered out of the window pretending he had tea with a bear at Paddington station everyday of his life
what's Paddington doing
oh_my_goodness
he's standing on the table
yikes
when Mrs Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw her hands up with horror
Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear
he's covered all over with cream and jam
oh is that the mommy
that's Mrs Brown the mommy
and there's the daddy
and
that's Judy right
right
at the sound of Mrs Brown's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea
I think we better go before anything else happens said Mr Brown
and quickly led the way out of the cafeteria
Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it
what's on Paddington's foot
is that a cup
oh_my_goodness
that is so messy
come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi
and you both can have a nice hot bath
Paddington had never been in a taxi before
do you remember what color the taxis are in New York
in New York are they yellow
yes
he found it very exciting and stood on a lil tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people on the street
oh that's okay sweetie
you want that
soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack
I haven't gotten very much said Paddington only some marmalade
and my scrapbook
and this sort of South American penny
he held up a photograph and that's my aunt Lucy
she had it taken right before she went into the home for retired bears
what does that look like
it looks like a dime
I think it's a sort of penny
it's a type of penny
next Judy showed Paddington to the bathroom
as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto a stool to look out the window
then he tried writing his name on the steamy glass with his paw
it took him rather a long time
and when he looked around he found his surprise the bath was so full of water it started to run over the side
oh no
he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw
he jumped in
the water was hot soapy and very deep
then to his horror he found he couldn't get out
he couldn't even see to turn the taps off
oh no
Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so it's not to disturb anyone and then much louder
help help
but still nobody came
then he had an idea
he took off his hat and began to use it to bail out the water
downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
when suddenly she felt a plop
looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
Paddington she called he must be in trouble
quick
and together they raced out of the room
Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
what a mess said Jonathan
we better wipe it up pretty quickly
oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you
look at all that water on Paddington
they took him out of the bath tub
he's so wet isn't he
yes
Paddington sat up and said what good luck I had my hat
sometime later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
settling himself down in a small arm chair by the fire
he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
it was nice being a bear
especially a bear called Paddington
he had a feeling that life with the Brown's was going to be
fun
oh boy
okay

a lil bit better

oh Paddington's garden
Paddington's garden
one day Paddington decided to make a list of all the nice things there were about being a bear and living with the Brown's at number thirty two Winsor Gardens
it was a long list and he had almost reached the end of the paper when he suddenly realized he left out one of the nicest things of all
the garden itself
wow that's nice
Paddington liked the Brown's garden
it was quiet and peacefully and there were times when it might not have been in London at all
but nice gardens usually mean a lot of hard work
and after a day at his office Mr Brown often wished it wasn't quite so large
what's that
there's Mrs Brown she's the mommy
and the daddy too
it was Mrs Brown who first thought of giving Jonathan Judy and Paddington a piece each of their own
it will keep them out of mischief she said
and will help you at the same time
so Mr Brown marked up three squares and to make it more exciting he said he would give a price to whom ever had the best idea
early next morning all three set to work
Judy thought she would grow some flowers and Jonathan started to make a paved garden
but Paddington didn't know what to do
gardening was much harder than it looked
especially with paws and he soon grew tired of digging
in the end he decided to do some shopping
he had some savings
oh look he's buying what's he buying
seeds
and he has a basket
and the trowel
and he's gonna buy a lil wheel barrel to
it seemed very good value indeed
especially since he had two pence left over
the shop keeper told him that when planning a new garden it was a good idea to stand some way away first in order to picture what it would look like when it was finished
so taking a jar of his best chunky marmalade
Paddington set out to visit the near by building site
by the time he got there it was the middle of the morning
and as the men were all at their tea break he sat down on a pile of bricks
and put down his jar of marmalade
hm
after sitting there for some while without getting a single idea pit
Paddington decided to take a short walk instead
when he got back his eyes nearly popped out
a man was emptying the concrete mixer on the very spot where he had left his jar of marmalade
oh my
at that moment the foreman came round and seen the look on Paddington's face
he stopped to ask what was wrong
oh my chunks have been buried he exclaimed hotly
so they all set to work clearing the cement
but there was no sign of Paddington's jar
suddenly there was a worrying sound from over head
a platform landed at his feet
my marmalade he said
I put it there ready for my tea break and it must have been taken out by mistake
it was the foreman's turn to look as if he could hardly believe his eyes
that's quick drying cement
it's probably rock hard
and no one will give me two pence for it now
I will said Paddington
and he took the lumps of concrete home
and made a beautiful rockery
when the builders saw
there's his wheelbarrow
and his concrete and his trowel
concrete
wheelbarrow
trowel
trowel
and his seeds started to grow
it fit so well with Jonathan's paved garden and Judy's flower bed it that it looked as if the whole thing had been planned
and they celebrated by having tea in the new garden
after it was over Paddington stayed on for a while in order to finish his list of all the nice things there were
about being a bear and living at thirty two Winsor Gardens
