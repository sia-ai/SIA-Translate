I had this meeting with a nurse over there somebody I hadn't met
and then she had told me she was taking a little vacation last week
I
I think she was with a patient when she told me this over the phone
but she went into the hospital and I had heard I uh that she was pretty sick
and that she was
she told me today she has cancer
oh
a woman in her fiftys with I think five kids mostly married a couple in their teens
what kind of cancer
it wasn't too clear
what are you doing
she's got it in her mediastinum which is the area between her lungs
oh god
the area of lymph+nodes
it's probably probably a lung cancer
in other words it's metastasized or whatever it is
yeah

yeah
what's that
your napkin
is it nice and clean now
well the table isn't the floor isn't
well it was good she was able to tell me
it's been quite hard for her
I would think so
she's uh
the woman well the woman she works with who she's been friendly with she has not been able to tell
she says she's afraid if she tells them everyone comes to work and thus takes her mind uh remind her of it
why'd she tell you
well I think it was because our meeting was at the end of the day
and that she told me she has been straining to keep up a facade all day
and couldn't do it any longer
she kind of apologized she thought she was being unprofessional in telling me
which is part
of her self+abnegating nature
also I think she you know being a doctor she
is she a doctor
no my being a doctor
she wanted a little medical advice
oh
yeah
and wanted to know if I'd heard of her doctors and if I xxx medical center
did ya hear of her doctors
I heard of one of em
I suggested a consultation to discuss
not that that's necessarily an indication of anything
no

it's not hot
it's ice cold
mm
you better eat those scallops

here sweetie
say the that bread it didn't rise much but yet it tastes okay
the texture of it looks even ya know
it's too heavy
I don't know what the hell's wrong with that
I made it a half a dozen times
maybe freezing it does it
well but I buy it frozen
I I've read that
cause you did refrozen maybe
well I've read that it's hard to refreeze dough properly
but I never had any problems with this Pepperidge Farm stuff and then the last couple a batches I really let em rise I make
it happened last time
I thought I didn't let it rise enough
but I left it out for seven hours
it said two or three
to really double in bulk ya know I left it out overnight
of course when I made it
what
excuse me
what
whatsa the matter
oh
when I made it successfully it was in the summer and that made a difference
that in the warmer weather it would rise better
I dunno
maybe
well I'll leave it out forever and ever next time
well in the kitchen it's out_of the freezer
yeah but I left it in here and I put it on the radiator for five hours
so you know it oughta handle it
the other time I left the oven I turned the oven on and turned it off and left it in there for xxx
how about your potatos

oh yum
ahem
we spill at least once a day if not twice
I think this is the third time today
this morning we had to change his pants because he had orange juice all over them
I must say the spilling is much quieter because you don't swear when the tape recorder's on

I wasn't restraining myself
I was too tired to swear

Nanny
Anthony
and Cleopatra
an and a brick man
brick man
Mason the brick man
ya know Ned proposed to let to use that same roof that's already out there
that was my idea
oh
and he was bitching and moaning about oh no it'd be so much work
I oh uh it'd be harder
he was bitching and moaning about everything
uh hee
harder
I'd rather he didn't leave it
I'd rather have a different kind of roof
oh you would
I thought it would be cheaper
this is gonna look dumb
and he wants to put another on of those
you go out and take a look
first of all the roof looks dumb
alright
it really does look dumb
alright
over those sliding glass doors
but he didn't wa he didn't know
well
what to do about
remember
the other side anyways
and he's gonna put in a pillar even though the pillar might block the view
well he we discussed it remember
he said if you're building a deck that'll be ya know two hundred dollars
if ya wanna put a roof on he's gotta put in concrete footings a foundation cause it's gottaar a_lot_of
you know what he's gonna do now
cause it's gotta bear a lotta weight to put up columns and then bear the weight of the roof
you know what he's gonna do now
he's gonna use the steps as the foundation
he wants to
he really wants it to be concrete back there is what it comes right down to
and he'd like to use the the steps rather than take them down
he'd like to use them as the foundation
well
if he's gonna cut
gesundheit
he'll build a deck right out
well the thing
we were gonna do that that's fine
except those steps are too high that's what he told me
that's right
that's a problem
so what's he gonna do about that
I don't know
raise the house up
cause the problem is about that is you have a mini step and then you have a step that's too big and that's that's part of why Martin trips coming down there
I don't want have it if someone's gonna trip
right on the concrete
you don't care if it's under the deck
no I don't care if it's under the deck
achoo

try it and see
I see that the dining+room table is now a play+room
the the uh table is folded up
it's one of those kinds of tables
mm
so_that if we have guests or something

Ernie
I don't know
this is a one a Sesame_street record
it's an alphabet record
it's wonderful
whole record that way
it has every letter of the alphabet
I've never seen it in a store
but the library has it
so we took it out from there
which library
Cambridge Public Library
oh that's nice
Nanette goes every Tuesday morning
they have a preschool story hour
yeah
there's the catchup
only the kids that go um are all Nanette's age
and nobody will read them a story
because they think they're too young
but we've developed this wonderful play+group
so every week the same mothers go with the same kids
and it's not like bringing a play+group to your house
and they've got all the toys and records and the books
that's nice
and it's just wonderful
I don't know whether they've caught on yet
but
to today they might have caught on
because remember last time we wore the ear+phones when we listened to the record
what did we do this time
we heard it without the ear+phones because we we uh were playing the ear+phones so loud that the man gave us the actual speaker
and we was the only ones in the library and they were playing
it was wonderful

no she's
I think Nanette started to say she was going to bang me
then she said she's gonna go
bazam
cause she told me earlier today she was gonna bang me
are you mad at me
why
that's why
because Nanette ate the Playdoh
and I told her she couldn't eat the Playdoh
and where was I going to put it
in the closet
until you can learn
how what
that's right
until you can learn how to play with it
because Playdoh is not for eating
that's why you're mad at me
I'm glad you told me
you wanna make it a little louder
okay
I'll do it for you
you're dancing to it
we who's this now
they're doing the letter
r
