probably Daddy can fix it
I think Daddy's downstairs
I'm gonna get you some
I just have_to get Daddy to come upstairs and help fix the door first
or maybe even we left them at the vacation house
I think
that's possible
xxx xxx
because I can't
I haven't seen them in our house for a while
so I
we should ask Babaji and Dadaji if we left them there
either that or they're in one of the cooler bags
or could be in Mommy's purse even
oh I didn't even get you your food yet
they might look in their silverware drawer
and find
the missing spoons
it's possible
that they might be able to find them
I'm gonna bury the berries
I'm gonna bury them in yogurt
there you go
there you go
know why it wasn't working anyway
there now it should be working
I'm gonna play it back and see what happens

and here's a different kind of halves you could put together
Naima this is one that's cut on the diagonal

actually I got them when we were in Providence at the grocery store
oh
last month
organic
mhm
there's no pears on Cape Cod
sometimes it seems that way
the ones on Cape Cod aren't usually organic
oh
but you know what you need to do is to grow one
grow a pear tree
well
fruit growing on Cape Cod is
not good
not
it doesn't xxx it doesn't work because of
because of fungi and
oh mhm
uh those xxx some diseases
more so even than pests but
hm
I know people that have terrible trouble growing apples
and even people who
the one guy I know who used to grow apples organically switched over to
hm
using some kind of technology
chemical because it was just impossible
here
mhm
well
and even in Massachusetts I don't think there's any certified organic apples
uh you know xxx has an apple tree

okay
do you wanna do it while Grandma xxx still here

Grandma xxx do we have time to do that after breakfast
yeah
okay
what time is it getting
eight forty
yeah
maybe Grandma xxx could read you a book while I cut your hair so that your head will stay still
what do you think
xxx xxx xxx
why
because you can't move your head when you're getting a haircut because the scissors could
hurt your neck a little bit
or they could cut your hair uneven
yeah
xxx xxx xxx
are you gonna put
the old+fashioned way to cut hair was to put a bowl over your head
xxx xxx xxx
do you know that
that's funny
in fact I think my friend Mary Dunny
she cuts her son's
they don't have their hair cut all year long and then
the one son comes up from North Carolina
and she puts a bowl over his head
and she puts a bowl over his head and cuts his hair
xxx xxx

well the blue+jay might spread the word that we've got bird+seed here
he might tell the other birds
and then the birds will come
different birds maybe
he will tell them ooh go over to that yard
that yard has a great bird+seed
because birds like to eat bird+seed

do you know why they can't get up
do you see the black thing on the bottom of the bird feeder

when I was here last year when you went on vacation
the first night you were gone on your vacation and Grandma was staying here alone there was a big big storm
a big storm
and I heard something knock this thing down
something was at the window
and it knocked it down
I didn't
it could have been a bear
it could have been but your Mommy says no bears on the Cape
that's right
so it must not
must have been a raccoon
zero xxx on the Cape
what else could it be that would knock down that bird feeder
hm
and I know it wasn't the storm
I don't
how could a
I don't think a squirrel
a tiger
on Cape Cod
escaped from the zoo
xxx xxx xxx
I don't think so
well it must
probably a raccoon
because I can't think of any
oh tell Grandma xxx about the raccoon that came
was it last week Naima
I think it was
well some time last week
what about it
tell tell her xxx
tell me the story
oh
was he trying to get into your garbage

and they tend to be these huge trees so no leaves and just
a kind of brighter pink
yeah
little flowers
