they're psyched if people work at the bank

they're just keeping
they're fighting it big time
they're like one of the only people
now that they have a_t_ms they're all set

yeah
you can fill up your accounts and manipulate those
and xxx stuff
yeah that's true
they've got a twenty four hour automated or operator assisted telephone line for questions xxx
yeah yeah
you're right
and then they've got your a_t_m machines for you basic banking needs
there's a proliferation of debit slash credit cards out there to total already to go into a bank and get cash

okay
baby kangaroo
a kangaroo is called a joey when it is a baby
joey is still only a few months old like all kangaroos he has strong back legs large feet and a long tail
when joey moves it's easy to see why his legs and body are so big and strong
he hops
joey bounces along on his back legs using his tail for balance
joey finds two other young kangaroos who are awake too
they start to wrestle each other poking tummies and tugging on ears and tails
little joey leads the others in a hopping race
a clucking noise makes him stop suddenly
it is his mother calling him
she uses this sound to tell joey that he has wandered too far from her
joey turns returns to his mother he is very tired now
he climbs head first into a small pouch on in his mother's tummy
the baby is the perfect the pouch is the perfect size for her baby
only joey's legs are sticking out
then he turns himself around in the pouch so he can see
a kangaroo's mother's pouch makes a great built+in bed for her babies
xxx isn't that a cool idea
an adult kangaroo stamps its foot on the ground that sound means danger
joey's mother lifts her head and sniffs the air
suddenly a dingo dog comes running from the trees
the kangaroos must escape
they jump away flying through the air
joey ducks down into his mother's pouch his mother has never moved so fast
mother kangaroo jumps xxx fast and far
the pack of dingo dogs can't keep up
soon the dingos drop back
the kangaroos are safe but they keep on moving
they are heading toward a patch of rain clouds
the kangaroos know that tasty green grass grows wherever rain has fallen
the group reaches its new home before dark
kangaroos settle into their new home
night is coming and it is getting cooler
joey and the other kangaroos will spend the evening feeding
joey's mother nibbles grass she uses her short front arms and big back feet to hop step forward
joey is still in her pouch xxx he stretches down to eat some grass too
joey's little tummy is full now joey leaves his mother's pouch
it is grooming time
he uses a paw to comb the fur on his legs
his arms tummy chest back and floppy ears
he licks his arm and rubs him all over his face
grooming keeps joey clean and keeps the biting bugs away
when joey is finished grooming he looks for a playmate
joey hops to a pool filled with fresh rain water
the pool is new to him
the land where he lives is normally very dry
joey looks into the water he sees another kangaroo looking back at him
who is it
do you know
he saw him in the water
he was looking in water
and you know what he actually saw his reflection it's like a mirror he only xxx he only saw himself
but he thought it was another kangaroo
joey leans closer to look in the water at the stranger's face
oops joey dips his nose in the water and gets all wet
the water feels wonderful joey hops right into the puddle
soon other young kangaroos join him there
they discover what older kangaroos already know
water is fun
wanna see all the footprints

in this circle of different ones

alright and then I gotta fill xxx the clothes okay
okay
the long winter snow is just beginning to melt away as mother snowy owl scrapes a shell or nest on top of a very small hill
yyy in spring it is cold on the arctic tundra
the ground is still wet so mother owl lines the nest with moss and feathers
she settles into the nest and she calls to father snowy owl
mother owl lays a glossy white roundish egg in the nest and sits on top of it
sharing the warmth of her body with the egg
father owl brings a lemming for her to eat so she doesn't have_to leave the nest
the next day mother owl lays another white egg and two days after that another
until there are eight eggs in the nest
the spring's wildflowers bloom bright as mother owl sits patiently on the nest
she and father owl call to each other to keep in touch
as the long spring days pass father owl makes many flights to hunt for lemmings and hares
he flies swiftly and silently
father owl brings back meals caught in his sharp claws
finally the first tiny owlet hatches out of the first egg laid by mother owl
baby snow is covered with soft white down
as soon as snowy is able to eat father and mother owl feed him tender bits they have stored nearby
the next day another owlet hatches
after seven days snowy has seven brothers and sisters
xxx can you see the one with his eyes open that's snowy which one has his eyes open
right
a caribou wanders too close to the nest mother and father owl shrill xxx to drive him off
snowy owl tries his hardest to xxx
xxx the caribou looks up from his grazing when the caribou turns and wanders away from the nest
father owl calls out a loud hoo hoo
snowy and the rest of the owlets are growing bigger every day
mother owl no longer covers them in the nest
mother owl stands guard near the nest while father owl searches for a hare to
feed the large family
during the mid summer when the arctic nights are as light as day snowy steps out of the nest and spreads his wings
snowy strides down the small hill he is the first owlet in the family to climb over the rocks
and walk through all of the wildflowers through the nest
he sees a snow goose gliding above him
snowy is so happy he hoots
mother owl and the owlets look over from the nest
to make sure snowy is safe
snowy spends many hours exploring the tundra around the nest
day by day his brothers and sisters become explorers too
as they grow old enough to leave the nest
look at him
is he cute
now can you remember any of these

it was morning in the jungle
steam rises up from the ground jungle xxx sparkle with dew
monkeys and birds chatter in the tree tops
it's a morning just like any other or is it
look three tiger cubs come tumbling out of their dark cave today is their first day outdoors they are eight weeks old and ready to explore
the bright sun makes the cubs blink
their eyes are used to the darkness of the cave
a monkey screams and two cubs scramble for cover
the third cub is smaller but much braver than her brothers
she looks for the monkey
her name is tiny tiger
one day she will grow up to be a beautiful tigress
a low grunting sound brings all three cubs running
the cubs know the familiar sound of their mother's voice
tiny tiger and her brothers follow mother tiger through the tall jungle grass
their stripes hide them very well
to other animals they looks like swaying grasses filled with shadows and sunlight
tiny tiger is amazed by the world around her there is so much to see smell and hear
tiny tiger sees her mother's long tail swing
she tries to catch it
mother holds her tail high out of her baby's reach
tiny tiger turns to chase her own tail round in circles she goes
her mother grunts softly
keep moving
the tiger family comes upon a small lake
it is quiet cool and shady
perfect for the hot tigers
first mother tiger checks the area for danger
no jackals or jaguars just a few harmless little birds
the three young tigers have never been swimming
like all tigers the three cubs love water
they march right in
the little cubs rustle and tumble by the cool jungle lake
tiny tiger sees a peacock
she takes a few steps toward the beautiful bird
it flies away
tiny tiger thinks the peacock is afraid of her
she is wrong
the bird has seen something in the large grass
suddenly a loud roar freezes tiny tiger in her tracks
there's another tiger here
the cubs run and hide behind her mother
mother tiger is not scared because she knows this visitor
he is father tiger
they rub necks to say hello
tiny tiger bravely jumps from behind her mother
she grows a baby growl
her father gently rubs her with his big paw before going on his way
tiny tiger is a playful cub
she creeps slowly and quietly to practice hunting
her little body stays low to the ground and her ears press flat against her head
suddenly she jumps
she has caught a peacock feather
one day tiny tiger will catch real food
today it's just for fun though
her brother chases her trying to steal her prize
the family returns home for a short nap
the cubs cuddle together under their cave
mother tiger washes each of the three cubs with her rough tongue
then she lies down with him to rest
after her nap mother tiger hunts for food for her little cubs
she leaves them safely napping near the cave
tiny tiger's legs kick as she sleeps
she flicks her tail and xxx growls softly
she dreams of the day when she will grow up to roam the jungle as a mighty tigress
she will grow up to be her
like her mama won't she
