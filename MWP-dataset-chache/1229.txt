okay

I think a little food would be a good idea
it willn't it won't be good
how about some smoothie
oh alright you want me to read that while you're eating and drinking
we could do that
yessie
then we'll come back and straighten up the living room
when we're done
let's go in here and have a little snack and I'll read the book to you how's that
is that what you want
right why don't you pick something out of the refrigerator
alright do you want baby yogurt because it's way in the back somewhere
oh okay what do you want
tofu
these are the grapes
and there's cheese
and hummus
and there's uhhh wheat shreds
that's milk
okay hummus to eat
smoothie to drink
you got it
you got it
it is snack time anyway
it certainly is snack time
it is
we need to buy more smoothie remember we went to the store yesterday and they didn't have the right kind of smoothie
they just didn't
that store doesn't carry that kind of smoothie I was very disappointed
yeah there is a picture of a cow right there
bah
that's what cows say
bah and gah
are you sure that's what cows say
really
I don't think so
I think cows say moo
they don't
cows say bah that's a good joke
oh that's not a joke
oh
snow sled
quite a long time ago
that one
oh
yeah we did buy a snow sled at the toy store
that was a long time ago
who wants to play in the snow with that
well if it snows I'll definitely give you that to play with
I'm gonna give you a smoothie
smoothie
let's put it in here
you want a paper cup
alright
you better use both hands
are you gonna have the hummus too
it's Mommy Day today
I didn't know it was Mommy Day
use both hands with that
Mommy Day
hm
do you wanna little cracker with your hummus or are you just gonna just use the spoon
okay I think you wanna try this kinda cracker
Akmak
with sesame seeds on it
mm
crunchy and good
Akmak
that's the kinda crackers they are
Akmak
Akmak
oh I heard a birdie
I thought it was a vulture
actually I didn't think that was a vulture
it doesn't sound like a vulture I'm gonna drink some orange juice
while you're having your snack
yeah
yeah because I'm thirsty
that's exactly what I was doing
how did you know that
um what does the police+man say to Corduroy
he says how did you get up here
why does he say that
yeah Corduroy went up the escalator all by himself
that's very strange for a little bear to do that all by himself
or herself
because bears don't usually walk around department stores all by themselves after dark
they might get lost
he did get a little bit lost didn't he
yes
he was trying to look for the button
well
um because he knows that the people who are in the store who want to buy a little bear he hears them say that they want bears who don't have lost buttons they want bears who already have their buttons
let's see here
wow you polished that right up didn't you
hungry girl
here's a bit more
oh boy
want some more akh makh too
you like that huh
that's how the akh makh is made
it's made with sesame seeds on it
that's just how it's made
did you have fun this morning
where did we go
do you remember
whose house did we go to
xxx house
that was fun
and you wanted to see what his high+chair looked like
and you saw it
looks like a restaurant high+chair doesn't it
it looks the same kinda restaurant um high+chair that restaurants usually use
well he has one that's like a restaurant high+chair but he uses it at home
what did you say
you're interesting
mhm
what are they called do you remember
akh makh yes
more smoothie
smoothie
smoothie
you're helping me okay
you've never seen what
you've never seen a Mommy duckling kissing her mommy duck
you've never seen a duckling hug her Mommy
why
what do ducks eat
I think they eat little plants that grow in the water
mostly
I dunno if ducks eat insects I'd like to find out
I think we should find out
maybe I'll write that we have a list of questions on the board
and one would be do ducks what do ducks eat
that's a very good question
I will write it down on our question sheet right now
our list of questions
what do ducks eat
I dunno I'm gonna find out for you
they live near the water
I think they drink water from ponds or lakes or
rivers
oh
just from lakes
I think we should go to Cape Cod Natural Foods
when you're done with your snack
so that we can buy more smoothie
because
because
we're out almost out of smoothie
you're about to you're about to finish
the last smoothie
and we also need some
uhhh canola oil
and fish sticks
yeah
you wanna eat drink some more
there's a little bit left
let's see
yeah okay
that's the end of it though
all gone
it's all gone
well how about drinking more smoothie
I heard you say that
but uh a smoothie is for drinking not for washing
it just is
okay Mommy's gonna make chili tonight
to eat chili is a food we eat it's spicy beans
yeah
what
you're a silly+willy
who's a silly+willy
mhm I'm cutting
hot peppers here
I'm gonna freeze these hot peppers
to use later or maybe I'll
use a little more of them now
I'm cutting those hot peppers
well they're very very hot and spicy so I don't wanna
cause you to sneeze excessively
there we go
we're gonna put these in the freezer
say excuse me
you burped and it's good manners to say excuse me when you burp
yeah
excuse me
it's empty
okay
no smoothie in there
there is
I thought it was all gone
dripping it
no smoothie
you still eating your hummus or are you finished with it
oh okay
what is that cracker called
remember
well I am still drinking it
because it's thirsty I'm thirsty
and I
wanna keep healthy
I'm not eating anything right now
I'm just drinking orange juice
there's no Daddy downstairs
you know where he is and what he's doing I think
yeah
he's gonna help people feel better
patients
what do you think
you know the answer to that question
he's gonna check their hearts oops
well I just realized that your bib and your microphone fell down
some time ago perhaps
there
he's gonna listen to their hearts with a stethoscope
what else does he do to help them feel better Naima
he looks in their ears with an otoscope
I don't think he does that a lot but I think once in a while maybe he does that
he figures out what kind of medicine they need
I'm cooking onions and garlic
and green hot spicy peppers
because I'm making chili
and chili's also gonna have black beans in it
and tomatoes
and we're gonna eat it for supper later on
you'll have chili
well right now it's just onions it's not that interesting
but
when it's all cooking everything's in it you can have a look at it
your hand's going away
oh it's very dark outside isn't it
I think it's overcast
you think it's gonna snow or rain
it doesn't really snow in the summer
just summer is not a time when there's snow
winter fall and spring are the only time when it snows
uhhh xxx house
what was he doing there
he was actually he was giving you little hugs
he wanted to touch you and give you hugs
and he actually give you a kiss on your back he's a very sneaky kisser
he likes to sneak up behind people and kiss them on the back of their head
well he's little
he's a little bit shy I think
oh hm

yeah that's not really a very important part of the
top
I think I'll call xxx xxx

two two
I'd take two or three bunches I mean it depends on how many you wanna get rid of
yes

I think that's fine
oh do you
do you have any peas yet or is that still a ways off

uhhh I would take a few I actually still have some from last week but
I'll take maybe just four leaves of that
oh flat I'll take another bunch of flat that was really good too

um so
we're about

cause that seemed to be a problem
really
I see more bear food here
how
how bout yogurt
would you like yogurt to have with those almonds
how bout some Oatios
how bout some Kamut cake
how bout some cheese
alright
I think bears do like cheese especially bear
I think bears do like cheese especially bear cubs
where's the cheese here it is
oh what a rawring bear
that's quite a rawr Naima
that's quite a roar
doesn't like the bear food
why not
why doesn't the bear like the bear food
what that's cheese you like cheese
a smaller piece
dyou say the bear's tummy would like a smaller piece
here put that cheese down I'll cut that too
put it down I'll cut it
very funny
very funny
it's a cheese square
you have
what
that's the shape of a curve oh that piece of cheese
let's see
yeah it does have a curve you're right
curve cheese
do you have any triangles
it doesn't rock well blocks that are curved can rock cheese that is curved probably won't rock as well
do you want crackers with your cheese

mm
hm
are you making a little sandwich
xxx is it a sunny day today
what kind of a day is it

are you sure it's not a Naima day
it's a lovely Naima day today
mhm I bet xxx would love to take you to the play+ground today
well maybe
well you need to make sure you have lunch before you have ice+cream
besides are you gonna go shopping with xxx and buy the eggs
but I need you to buy eggs
why not
that would be very helpful for Mommy
don't you like helping Mommy
no usually you do like helping
you joking
you're joking yeah
I thought so
rawr
you could be the only bear in the store if you go to the store
you could bring Grizzly to the store and put him next to you in the wagon
and Griz could ride in the car too
and Griz could wear the booties
and you could even carry him in the backpack in the store if you want
go with xxx and buy the eggs and show Griz where the eggs are in the store
I bet he doesn't know cause he's a little bear
yup you know and you could show him
you could show him what things a store has
I don't think Griz has I think maybe Sleepy Bear's been to the store with you but I don't think Griz has been to the store
Sleepy's a big bear
oh he can buy things
Sleepy or Griz
who are we talking about now
mhm
why do I think you should have lunch before ice+cream
cause ice+cream is a treat
it's a little bit special
and you need to make sure you have things with protein before you eat ice+cream
it's just a rule
it is a rule
don't spill that please
well please don't take it out that's gonna make a

oh the dress is affected by the humidity
just like your door stuck shut because it was affected by the humidity

because there's moisture
there's water in the air

water and moisture
in the air and it swells things up
