so you know what
we haven't seen her since our vacation
we gotta tell her what we did last week on our vacation
what'd you do
no we didn't go to the dinosaur thing but we did go to a general museum remember the children's museum
what was your favorite thing at the children's museum
the space shuttle yeah
what'd you what were you supposed to do at the space shuttle
um hm
it was very interesting what did you get to wear when you were at the space shuttle thing
um hm
and what were you supposed to pretend
that you were flying the space shuttle yeah it was super fun
you did cut it in half
I liked that one part that had the lobster bowl
what were we supposed to do with the lobster bowl
um hm
just the lobsters why what were we not supposed to try to catch
well what were you supposed to catch them in that was super fun
mhm they had the lobster traps remember that
that was fun
but then another thing that we did lots and lots_of times in the mornings what did we always go look for in the mornings usually
crabs yeah what else did we find what did we find actually
starfish what else did we find that was super cool
stars
oh like real stars in the sky
this one actually looks like it's looking pretty good
this one is a good one you can mush that one
here lets see if any of the other ones work because this one this is also one that xxx it just got old for some reason at the store
so um
that one too so those are ones that we can't use
so this is interesting so some work and some don't right
so that that red one looks like that could be pretty decent
so we found
that can definitely cover up that yeah that's xxx
so we found starfish and what were the other things that were cool remember there was one that was yellow and one that was red
remember
I'll give you a hint sometimes people use them to wash stuff
you don't remember the sponges
xxx and also
real live
this one's a really good one too
real live sponges
oh don't mix them
well what do you think
go ahead
we saw sponges and what's some other things that we did when we were on our vacation
so we went to the children's museum we went to Tide Pool what else did we do
you'll give me a hint okay
so there was lots_of rocks and there was lots_of sand so let me think where that could have been
was it ah the amusement park
the sand
the ocean
that was right by our house yup
so we would walk down and walk to the ocean in the mornings or in the afternoons
what did you buy to play with in the ocean
so you're giving me a hint
it was sharp teeth and it was very big
barracuda
no tell me
it was the shark blow up kind of thing yup
but then what happened what did they say about that big blow up toy
remember
are you giving me a hint okay
can you talk a little louder please because I can't xxx
it was high tide
yeah
so that's the hint okay since it was high tide they thought it would not be very safe right
you swimmed in high tide yes you sure did
sometimes you ended up with a bunch of water in your mouth
what did you think about that water anyway in general
yuck
what was yucky about the water
salt water yeah
xxx what was your favorite part of our whole vacation Boo
it was the beginning of our trip okay
that was your favorite thing going to the beach after we left or right after we left our house
yeah cool
we did something kind of fun on the way home too
remember the big mountain
yes we went hiking on a big big mountain
and it wasn't just me it wasn't just Daddy and me that hiked who else hiked
yes
so we went hiking in Massachusetts remember out on Mount
whoa you alright
on Mountain Gray Graylock
who do you think that is
I don't think that's Aladar do you
see it kinda looks like Aladar but then why would he have such a mean face
I think it is Aladar because look it's the same one
I thought he looked mean like how kinda like Croan looked mean
ah what are those
remember what kind of dinosaur those are
you don't remember their names
Carnadors
cool we'll have_to try to read that maybe at the end today okay
you're gonna look at it okay you can look at it
I'm not going to read it though because that will just take a lot of time of my talking okay
so you go ahead and look at it
is that who's that
Aladar's mom
what's gonna happen next
xxx is that
carnador yep
carnivore well carnadors are carnivores right

okay now what happens
they're in the dark cave yup
they got_to the island they were looking for yeah that's good
they're going that way where the carnivore was um hm
um hm
um hm
that's where he meets the carnivore by himself right and then what happens at the end
well they do find new monkeys but what is this little one holding
who's that
yeah I think it's supposed to be Aladar and then Nira's baby baby dinosaur they had a baby dinosaur at the end
well awesome that's really great because she may never have seen that movie do she never would have known what happened
you know what I noticed something
she was probably wondering about what happened here

what did we do right away
you don't know
what did I hurry up and go get
tissues yeah because we out by the tide pools and we didn't have there's no we didn't have any band aids right

you think they'll have enough space
so I'll take him home
okay so alright well I'll take him home

ring ring
yes are you the one who sold me this dinosaur
I have some more questions I didn't realize I would have questions but I have some questions
okay well I'm wondering about where he sleeps
I might have_to go to a pet store and get him a bed
do you guys sell beds
as big as a house
I see well that should be plenty big
alright well let me come over and check out what you got okay
alright you said you got some beds at your place here because I really need a bed for him I think
oh this whole thing
no wait I don't want all the dinosaurs there's too many
I got_to take them all
even all the plants too
what if somebody else comes by and they wanna buy something else
really
you have a whole other set of dinosaurs for somebody else who might come
I'm also concerned about how much this is going to cost me
one dollar for all of these
okay
I'm a little worried about this one
he does have sharp teeth
what did you say the other day
I see he eats kinda spiky plants okay
hard plants
so you're telling me he's not going to eat my other dinosaurs
alright okay another plant
oh okay
alright thank you
okay great I'm set
that what's that for
it's a little intercom so if somebody's in another part of the store like lets say so if somebody brought you something that didn't have a price tag on it you could say okay we need a price check for spaghetti
then the person who's in the juice aisle will come and see what it is you need a price check on
okay
alright I'm going to take all these home here's your money
that's here you go here's your dollar
you just ate the money
oh_my_goodness
I'm going to set them up over here
hello
you know what it's so interesting that you're calling me because I actually have some questions for you about all the dinosaurs you sold me
well you xxx that none of them were dangerous but they are fighting
because they xxx they all want to live in a certain spot
how am I gonna decide who gets to live in the best spot
alright thank you bye
well see this is the area of concern
everybody wants to live right by the pond
how am I going to do it
they all want to live right by the pond so they don't have_to walk far to drink some nice cool water
okay
I see so maybe some of them would be willing to live up here
mhm
well this one doesn't want to live here though he already told me that because there is a volcano erupting
that doesn't seem like the best spot you know
okay so they just have_to divide themselves up huh and find different areas to live in
then I also have another problem
this one here has been crying
he says that he's very small and misses his mommy
oh so we just got_to make sure they're together
did she adopt him because she doesn't look very much like him
oh okay
where do you think I should put my plants and my trees where they can get to them and have a lot of food
he's got a good spot then for the trees then
wow that's actually really great I guess they've got it figured out now
mhm
who does
how do you know he likes to drink lava
bye thank you so much
okay should I just call if I have any trouble
okay thank you so much
I appreciate your help
really
good thing you brought your car back
alright let's say that I came in I ran out of green food
hello are you still open
I'm running in to some trouble right now because you know I put the trees in that you gave me but there's so many dinosaurs they ate all the green food
um no the problem is there's plenty of water they just need more food
oh okay so they can drink milk awesome okay
so no way this is like three different types of things that they can drink thank you
well alright well I feel better and what are these
oh okay okay so
oh okay so this is if they're thirsty okay
oh you gotta ring them up right
you don't have any do you have anymore green food
oh you gave me all you had huh
alrighty great job
thank you so much I was about ready to forget your dollar
how can you eat money
don't you need the money
don't you need to save the money
oh you keep it in your mouth
hello yes
well you know no not really because I put the food aside and I gave them some of the milk and some of the bread and they seem to be doing pretty good with it
they're not they're not really arguing anymore but you know I'm afraid about something that could happen tonight
some of them seem afraid of the dark
what could I do
you just have one big one one flashlight
oh you're bringing it over
okay great
thank you so much
you can see oh yeah this light is amazing it's so bright for such a small flashlight
it's so amazing
so all you have_to do is open it up and squeeze it huh and the light comes out
wow that light is so awesome
now where should we keep the light you know because they're kinda spread out
just anywhere maybe if I put it up here in the sky in a tree or something
then all of them will have light does that sound like a good idea
okay it runs on batteries huh
yes hello
that's awesome xxx
well I need like three or four but if that's okay you can bring them over three or four batteries should do it
oh okay let me ask them
do you guys want some chocolate milk
no yes yes I do me too
oh okay it looks like we need a bunch
looks like we need as much as you can get
they're very thirsty
okay that sounds good
okay great you know those batteries are going to run out at some point
you know I could use the batteries for other things too
thank you
alright well let me see now everyone has to get in line in order to have their ah chocolate milk given to them
you know how you have_to wait your turn sometimes
how about a T_Rex he's the first one in line

like maybe a new shirt that was Roman's
something more like a toy
what if they don't get rid of their toys they might just get rid of their baby toys
they probably wouldn't wanna give away their fun toys now
they can bring things to their new house
what did they say
well I think they don't wanna bring that much because they have so much stuff and there's not that much space in their new house
but they're gonna keep some stuff
they're not going to buy all new toys right or games or puzzles or books right
oh would that how would you like that

but I never heard that before
he said they're things that would help
xxx to help
what did I just say
water oh
well a flashlight no I don't know a flashlight yes he said that that would help him he'd feel more comfortable
sleeping at night and he would stop neighing
oh you mean the flashlight from before
this is it
alright so I'll bring this flashlight over for him to use okay
um hm
extra batteries okay
you know he said he'd actually like to live right over here you know why
because he's very nervous about the dinosaurs

so he's quite nervous actually
what are you gonna to tell him
she's totally set up stuff
did you want your milk
tell Leslie where you've been that we just ran in real quick to get some food at home

so you fell off and you got really really wet
and then what did you do actually
you walked a little more

yeah that was a really kind of weird thing that happened with that right
was the water really deep
did your hair get wet
no it wasn't super deep
so yeah we went to the river that was a super fun time
because of all the river water on you right
yeah that was a smart idea to take a shower
that used to be the bottom of the ocean you're right
but now what is it
definitely because the whole thing was ocean right pretty much everywhere was ocean
that's why remember we found those rocks that had little shells fossil shells on it because that used to be the ocean
I'm trying to think about something interesting else that we've been doing
we went to a birthday party the other day
well what did you guys do at the party
you're so excited to say what
I'll give you a hint
the clue is three or four pieces
that was kinda funny about the party three or four pieces of what
the game yup there was three or four pieces of the game you had to collect right

so why don't you tell Leslie about the cake
what
that was so tasty that what
it was tasty that you
almost could scream
well he kept taking little pieces of cake right and then I kept giving you some more and more and more
oh my gosh he had so much cake at the party
and then there was this game how did you have_to do the game

well she won't put her legs down they're always poking up on the bed
is there anything that can be done
you think she's saying that she wants some food
okay well do you sell food there
you don't remember what that's called jello
mhm
mhm
berries okay
I was wondering this looks really tasty can she drink this like it's a bottle can I give her this to drink out of
okay yeah I'll buy her this to drink
it's just free
all the accessories and everything that goes with the doll is free
okay well I'll have the ketchup then
ring ring ring
I have another problem
well you know what happened
she threw up
I was wondering if I could buy some cleaning supplies so I could clean up the stuff that she threw up
oh gross
oh yuck no no I don't want a dog to lick it up the ketchup that she threw up no don't you have any like tissues or cleaning stuff
I'll come over and buy some water
okay do you have some water for me
do you have any napkins or anything
okay I'll just dump it all over the bed
ring ring ring
well now she's real hungry again because she threw up what else would you suggest
soup okay
whaa whaa
ring ring
whaa whaa
do you hear that
oh my gosh she's totally crying
I dunno if she liked that soup
alright
I'll make some jello
mix it up you gotta put it in the fridge for awhile
okay little baby doll come on and eat your jello
oh_my_goodness
ring ring ring excuse me
I don't think the jello idea was very good
she poured the jello all over her head
let's see what this is supposed to be chocolate nuts
okay maybe she'd like those
oh I just wanted to thank you the chocolate nuts are great she ate them and she's probably fine now
I won't bother you anymore goodbye
okay pretend that we just walked by we didn't call you up but we came and walked by
ring ring ring excuse me
we were wondering if you know where she could get her hair cut it's kinda long
a horse could chew it off alright well maybe I'll just sit her up right here is that gonna work
oh no
I thought we were just gonna make it a little shorter now she's bald
you ate all of her hair
oh_my_goodness
the horse would have_to have time out because he ate all of her hair off
alright well look it grew back she's fine
I was thinking about what else we've been doing we went on a trip to Chicago
tell her about what you saw in Chicago
the tallest building where
is it the tallest building in the town or the tallest building in the city or the tallest building in the what
the tallest building in the world it's called the Sears tower do you remember what was very interesting when we left Chicago about the Sears tower
why didn't we see the top
so we were only able to see the bottom how did Daddy even know where the building was
remember it was a little different from the other ones because it was a dark dark building
and he knew where it was located so that's how he kind of knew he said that's it that's the Sears tower right there
cool oh she doesn't know this story either
this is a story that I was a little bit a little bit I don't know if I'd say angry about but I was a little bit hm remember when we were going to Chicago and I told the lady not to give you the toy
okay tell her the whole story what happened
well you didn't really beg for one but you said you wanted one but she asked you she said do you want one and what did you say
and what did she do even though I said no toy what did she do
she gave you one anyway right
but it was a cool toy remember what kind of toy it was
mhm it was cool push the button on the snakes head right and then the little big rock would come up and it would make the car go flying
you might be able to make that car go all the way up to the ceiling
what did you do I dropped my shoe that's what that noise was what did you do
did you drop your shoe too
that's what mine did mine fell off too
what did you do at Brandon and Aaron's house with the cars do you remember it was kinda cool
made then super tall
yup you made it super tall you connected all the little car sets together
oh_my_goodness
hey you know what Leslie also doesn't know what's been going on with our car oh_my_goodness
what's been going on with our car
what
you're too scared to say
well first we had problems with our started and then they fixed it but then they didn't fix it entirely right and we had to send it back and you were so happy right
yeah and then we had the rental car which you liked a lot
remember you were even kinda fussy and you were like you wanted to keep that rental car forever and I'm like we can't we have_to pay for it everyday
so now what's wrong with the car
you said what do you know about this
so what's wrong with the car now even though we got it fixed
the window's broken what's broken about it
yeah it's stuck open we're hoping it doesn't rain
yeah we've had lots_of problems with that car
we were actually supposed to come here last week and meet her and that was the day the car we got it stuck at your school remember
oh_my_goodness we got stuck at his school and it would not start that was bad
I'm trying to think what else we've been doing Matty
so let's see we went to Chicago and you started school and
do you wanna play with the dollhouse or the dinosaurs or look what she brought
do you wanna see what she brought
what do you think of that does he look super duper strong
hey that guy looked kinda scary
they are sparkly ones aren't they
do you wanna color any of it
he seems pretty strong I have_to say what do you think
what do you think about this face
do you wanna pick a page to color
oh_my_goodness
he is all scratched up
what did you have_to do at school with like the big A and little a do you remember that one picture
do you remember
are you saying no
okay
all the crayons out to do this okay
oh no that one's broke how sad
you need to be all the same facing the same way and the same height okay
mhm
oh what do you think about that is that all going to fit
oh_my_goodness
okay which you can have upside down I see
cool that reminds me of something that you made at your school do you remember
the first day of school you came home and you told me about how you made a rainbow right that kinda looks like a rainbow with the different colors
yes
whoa
he totally does he's multicolored you would say
he's pretty cool do you remember what color the hulk really is
yeah green is that still your favorite color or do you have a new favorite color
okay your very favorite's this one and this is like your second favorite number two
okay which one do you like next after that
your very favorite is the one that goes down okay
that one the light pink
hm cool I like all those colors too
lets see if I had to pick my favorite it probably would be
mhm
I get this group okay
is this where I get to pick from for my favorite
mm okay because I think my favorite out of this group is probably this because look almost the same as my sweater today
okay so I gotta do it the same way
mhm
we each have three is that how many you have
oh one two three four one two three four how many do you have in your hand
and I have three so the reason we don't have the exact same number is because we have mister broken one here
so nobody gets him right
okay which color are we gonna do which page you wanna do
this is me should I color the rose
three different colors and see how that comes out
this is interesting you know why
you don't really see the blue you know this light blue I didn't realize it but you don't see that color as well
how did yours come out
oh mostly orange isn't that interesting you actually had all four colors but how come you only mostly see the orange
okay
all of them whoa I got seven of them
I dunno you gotta count them
ah I think you have eight
yes you do I only have seven
okay ready what am I gonna color this rose with all these colors
okay
orange and then I notice this coming out sort of the purple over there
mhm
oh we had to trade
yes and I have kind of this yellow green yellow with rainbow glitter it doesn't look like yellow
it looks like yellow green doesn't it
okay I'm gonna draw right here
mhm
it's kind of hard to draw with more than one isn't it
mostly I see
green definitely green but your orange and your red comes out pretty good too
the only one you really can't see very well is the light pink you don't see light pink really
mm almost it almost looks like this color this darker pinkish color
could ya see that
ah yup
I put your name on it
you write your name all the time at school now don't you
did you ever think about being with the y at the end
so you're just Matt huh
just Matt
what if you had a long name like Zachias
you know what's going to be a big thing for you to spell
Zevenbergen
if you have other Matthews you might just be Matthew z for awhile
or Matty or Matt Z
oops we don't want to break him okay that one already had a broken but we don't any other ones to break
so we're gonna end up going pretty soon so what do you want to do at the end of our time here
sell dinosaurs okay
okay sell dinosaurs oh and drink milk
alright so let's see now I think I will buy this one he seems gentle
oh is he gonna end up scratching my house and my furniture
hm that's no good so which one would you suggest
uhhuh
I'll buy the duckbill
he seems like he's gonna be okay
does he need a swimming pool
well see I don't know if I want the pool then because I don't want to have_to take care of all these animals
maybe how about this maybe I'll just buy the bed
it's kind of complicated to have_to take all those animals too
do I wanna buy dinosaur hm
well you know I do need a new pet which dinosaur would you recommend
these two how come those two
they're not a meat eater
well if I only have room for one which one shall I choose
the duckbill okay
how do we know what colors they really were
what
oh The Land Before Time says what color they were
when you watch the show right
yeah is this the same one as say Ducky's mom did they color this one the same
yeah they are kind of a lighter green on The Land Before Time I don't know why they made this one blue hm interesting
mhm that one's kinda green here and blue here right
well alright I'll take this duckbill how much does it cost
three one thirty one
thirty one cents
okay that's my thirty one cents
don't you ever put it inside your cash register
no what do you do with the money
just eat it
okay well I'll take this home but what do I need to know about taking care of this particular dinosaur
this if he wants to eat
okay will this be enough food
okay if I'm buying some more take all of these okay
alright how much do these cost
thirty one
okay
now what would you recommend in terms of where he should sleep
inside there
inside here
how does he get inside
I don't know I'm not sure
it's the only container you have
well should I see if he fits in any of these
I mean his head is in pretty good shape but what about the rest of his body
I know
oh alright well which is his favorite
the water one well I'll buy that one
oh I see that makes sense that he would like this one because it's like water right
okay alright how much does this bed cost
free now should I call this a bed is this like a bed
okay and is this how I set it up set it up there and he'll come and sleep like that
alright so I got a bed for him I got food anything else I need for the duckbill
all he needs is a friend
well won't the friend end up eating all the food
no okay well are you sure he really needs a friend or might he like to live by himself
okay whenever he sees one of his friends he goes over to it
the pterodactyl also
how shall I choose which one gets to go home with him
hm should he choose or do you think it would be mean for him to choose his best friend
take them all home you think huh how do these guys sleep
because I know he sleeps with his head in how do these guys sleep
oh I see they each just put their head in one of them see just each of their heads
so I can take all of these I don't think I have enough money for all of these things
just since I bought him and bought the trees that's all I get all the rest of this for free
okay sounds pretty good to me
unless are they gonna destroy my house
are you sure do you have a bag
how am I gonna carry all this stuff home
oh okay thank you this looks like this will work
