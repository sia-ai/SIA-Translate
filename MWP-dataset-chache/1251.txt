well I'm gonna use it up there as a bookend cause that's what it's
oops
Naima come put it up here
I'll show you how it works
right up here it's gonna be like an extra space for your books
I thought I'd put all the paperbacks in this nice box so they'd be easy to get out and read
Naima
keep em in the red box
it's a good place for them
yes like this
I'm gonna show you
see the wall is one end
and it keeps all the books from falling
why don't you pick out some clean clothes to wear today
it might be a good day for shorts or or leggings or even a dress if you feel like it
I know you like shorts though
aren't you a girl who likes shorts
I thought so
yeah
you're disattached again
okay
I'm a nursie in the other room

this is
this is about people
you might like these pictures

and look there's tents and they use reindeer
look at that
tent it's made out of animal
fur

animal skins to keep it warm
I think that's pretty interesting
and look at all the snow on the ground
about the polar+bears

we should go in very soon and get something for you to eat
what would you like
would you like some cooked egg white
I think that xxx takes her but she's big
a big girl so she just has a teacher
and the other kids and the parent doesn't go to her class
which is what you'll do eventually
when you're ready
but today you'll go with Daddy
xxx xxx xxx
now would you like some scrambled egg before you go
Emma I'm asking you a question
how about some
you could have some Manchego cheese
yeah cause Emma's a big girl she doesn't need a parent to be in the swim class with her
she has a different kind of swim class
the kind where the parent doesn't have_to go
okay
no right now I'm not looking cause I'm looking at what I need to do

well I guess I was calling to investigate
scattered and overgrown a little bit so
I'm talking to Daddy honey xxx
finish packing
well I mean at this point it's a difference of how many minutes that you would lose
yeah see that would make it
I think that's gonna make the difference of whether she actually makes it to the swim class
because for me to
she also she's just eating some
second breakfast cause she had practically nothing earlier
so
well um that would make a difference
if it's only twenty minutes in terms of your work tomorrow I would get xxx xxx home now if you wanna do swim class
well that is a possibility
I mean I wouldn't discount that
but I
yes
you want a pancake
she wants a pancake
okay

Daddy's gonna come home and go to swim class with you in a little while
