in fact do you know what we could do
Guy
we could play store
and I could buy things from the store
and then
well let's pretend that this is a food store and we wanna buy some things okay
and you be in charge of the cash register
for example suppose I wanted to buy some cookies and take them home
an you you see have_to charge me the price that's on the package
which is ninety seven
but ninety seven is hard to do
let's say that it's fifty cents
let's say it's fifty cents
one
one dollar
that's a lot for a package of cookies isn't it
okay one dollar
now
shall we buy some mustard

ten
okay push it
now all together it costs nine dollars I'm going to give you
a ten dollar bill
let's pretend this is money okay
now you have_to give me some change because it doesn't cost quite this much
it costs nine fifty that's it
alright now may I show you how much to give me
ten
okay
you have_to give me fifty cents total
that's ten
that's thirty five
another fifteen cents is required
no that's too much

twenty five
watch Guy and I can show you

each of these is five
forty
no still too much
or you could do it this way
would you like ta to give me two quarters
like this

okay then you get this
see and then you would put this in here except it doesn't quite fit so we'll put it back
you see Guy
at the store when you buy food and things and when you're leaving the person at the cash register tells you how much you owe and then you give that person some money
and then and then what
would I
do you like Oreos
you do like Oreos
okay this one is twenty cents
zero
no no
zero means that we would get it for nothing
twenty cents
right
okay okay now uh if I had twenty cents I would give you twenty cents an you could put it in there
okay
let's put this back now
and let's look at some other things shall we
well let's go see
but first let's close up the store
come
help me
that's a boy
let's go see what's over here
let's see oh look at this
a nice story
well let's do this first and then the car
why don't you sit over there on the chair sweet+heart
would you like to sit on my lap instead
okay this is called The_great_cat_chase
a wordless book
oh my
perhaps you and I can tell what's going on
what's happening here
a lady is taking a kitty for a walk in
in a carriage
right
and she stops to pick some flowers and what happens
what's the kitty doing
running away
why's he doing that
afraid
afraid of what sweetheart
well perhaps we can see
and his mommy realizes suddenly that he's run away
he's hiding behind the tree
he doesn't look afraid
he looks like he playing a trick on his mommy
well the mommy runs down the street saying
Mr Policeman help
my kitty has run away
and I don't know where he is what's the policeman say
I don't know
what do you think he says
he says
Madame may I help you
see the policeman is stopping traffic
actually I think it's a little boy in a policeman's outfit
and he's telling another little boy on a tricycle to stop
well the policeman and the lady are talking about the kitty who's run away and all of a sudden what do they see
well tell me
that's right
and the policeman says
look there is is
there's your kitty
and then what do you think happens Guy
why is the police
why is the policeman down here on his knees
well why do you think
he's saying to the kitty
come here kitty
come here kitty
and the policeman leans forward to quickly grab the kitty and the kitty runs away
and what's the lady saying to the policeman
she's saying to him
officer go rescue my cat
and they follow the kitty
but where's the kitty going
through a tunnel
you know what this is
it's a big water pipe
big water pipe
and now the kitty doesn't think this is funny anymore does he
he doesn't look so happy
I think he's gonna go in there to try to get away from the policeman and his mommy
what happens here
what are they doing
well what well what do you see them doing
where are they going
they're going in here
yeah
but the kitty's already left the pipe and is up on top looking in ahhah
what happens
the policeman comes all the way through the drain pipe and the kitty's not there at all
where is the kitty
where do you see the kitty
up on top of the pipe right
and then
the mommy comes through and says
there he goes he's running up the hill officer
get my kitty
but then you know what happens
what
see this lady
she's wearing a very heavy coat and she got stuck in the drain pipe
see
and the policeman reached up to grab her to help her get out and pulled and before you knew it they were both falling in the water
but then the cat who came close to watch jumped into the drain pipe
and the lady says
officer there goes my cat
please get him for me
so they struggle back up into the drain pipe
hm
I'm trying to figure out what happens here
okay this is ba this is the other end
they've turned the pipe around
okay
cash register
we've already done that sweet+heart
but you know what we can do
we can look at that interesting car that's in the box
would you like to do that

mhm
oh what are those things
do you have any idea
pliers
mhm
and what's this
is this what you're calling pliers
well it's not really pliers
it's called
it's a wrench Guy
um well it looks like it's a jack
you see
and what's this
right
but you know s something
oh I see
that's right
well you have_to keep turning Guy
the screw is in further than that
that's a boy
not quite
would you like me to help
good
you did it
yeah very good
unscrew
yes
member what Daddy told you about clockwise and counter+clockwise
perhaps it would be easier here if we turned it like this
that's right
that's called counter+clockwise isn't it
yes you did
almost
little bit more
good
yes you did
okay what else would you like to do
the motor
where is the motor
really
ah
that's the trunk
that's where the extra tire is kept
where do you think the motor is if this is the trunk
yeah
here
hm you know what you could do if you wanted to
you could pretend that this tire was flat and had a hole in it and that you have_to put on a spare tire
would you like to do that
and then you could screw it back in
don't wanna do that
okay
Guy
some day if our car has a flat tire you and and I can fix it the way you're doing this
you know that
would you like to do that
you would
if you're big enough you can do it all yourself
ahhah
how many have you taken off sweet+heart
that's right
and you took one out of here right
xxx three
right
more
what makes you think so
yes you did
mhm
what would you like to do
there's still a motor
where do you think it is
that's right
try to figure it out sweet+heart
we have some other tools you know
here is a tool and here is a tool
perhaps one of these could be used
that one
or this one
alright
ah
I think you're right
you are right
I think you're doing pretty well
why don't you try
that's a boy let's see
you're doing very well
mhm
what would you like to do
well there are bumpers to take off
these are called bumpers
this is a bumper
and this in back here is a bumper
that's to protect the car in case it bumps into something
why do you think so
wonder if this would work
set it would
ahhah this would work too wouldn't it
you did it
maybe you'll be a car fixer when you grow up Guy
what do you think
well there's another bumper
and here are some things that you could maybe take apart
hm
mhm
it came easily didn't it
oh Guy sweet+heart see it's still attached here
you have one more
yeah
oop
pick it up please
now shall we put it back together
I think you hafta do two more things
well that is called a bolt
and there's another one that you hafta take out
can you find it
mhm
oh my
that must have been the last one
yeah
ach
do you think you can ever put that back together
oh Guy what do we do now
gee
what's this
would you like to try to put it back together
well may I make a suggestion to you
okay can you see these things
these are
these are bolts
and in order for them to be turned tight and hold things you hafta screw them in like this
see
what you did
may I may I see this please
what you did was to loosen like this until it fell out and things came apart
but you hafta use these as_well
and what that means is that they hafta go here see
see how that fits in there
you see
you didn't you didn't know that did you
and then this goes in like that after the wheel is on
so before we put on the hood what we should do is put these in place shouldn't we
here
would you like to put a blue one in here
that's where the bumper goes
that's a boy
now um you see these places
yes
yes that's okay
I think that goes there
and one goes here
good
and this one goes here
and this one
okay now there should be some yellow ones
these are for the wheels
they go on the inside for each wheel
do you see some other places where they could go
I don't think so sweet+heart
where do you think
it's for the wheels
where do you think the wheels go
where do the wheels go
yes
there's one
can you see another place where a wheel goes
okay so where does this go now
but on the inside
on the inside
here Guy
that's a boy
and yes
very good
now let's see if we know how to put the wheels back on
I think like this Guy
watch watch
see
see how I have that up
and then you put in the bolt
okay
now this is turning clockwise isn't it
is there something wrong
really
well perhaps we should see if something is ah
what have we done wrong

I don't think that makes a difference
do you know something
I think we're doing something wrong

let's take it off
see that hole there
that's what it is
now put
yeah see
the the wheel fits in there
that's it
now that's a boy

you hafta put the bolt back through the wheel
here here's a bolt
put it through the wheel
yes
now tighten it a little so it will stay
that's it

when you when you screw something or unscrew it this should be straight
not to the side
