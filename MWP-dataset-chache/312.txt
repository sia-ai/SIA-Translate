you're in the pasture
what are you doing in the pasture
you're scared
of what
maybe you should be scared of falling
scared of monsters
what kind of monsters are in the pasture
red and green monsters
red and green
isn't the pasture where they're supposed to go eat
yeah
I dunno maybe not
maybe they
they're gonna eat this up
oh no
the monsters
what should they do
ew
they could eat the tissues
maybe I shouldn't have asked
you're kidding
so the monsters will go away if these horses eat the tissues and spit them out
maybe the monsters will go away because they'll think ew that's gross
very brave horsies
very very brave
well you you seem to know the story
I've never heard this one before
I don't know the story either
can you tell it to us
no
I think you're making it up as it goes along
aren't you
I don't know the story
you're gonna have_to tell it to us
you can't
maybe I can help you
once upon a time there was
and their names were
okay
they ve liked to
they liked to play in the pasture
and every day they liked to eat
what did they like to eat
oh
they liked to eat grass
and every day they got thirsty and then they
when they were very tired they usually
where did they do that
very nice
oh they're all tucked in
then they would go to sleep and when they slept what would happen
wow
these horsies are just like us
now what did the mommy always say to the baby horse
no
no
what did the mommy say to the baby horse every time
go in your room
because there are no
but the mommy horse didn't want any monsters there did it
so what did the mommy horse do
she what the monsters
I don't even think she needed to do that
I think all she did was ran over to the other stable and the monsters got
because they'd never seen such a
such a mommy horse
and so the monsters all disappeared right
well then the mommy had to think about something else to do
because the baby horse became very very brave
wow
careful
they were very brave
when she came back the mommy horse said you have been very very brave
you are no longer afraid of the monsters
not anymore
I am very proud of you
the monster put what
mud
oh
those monsters aren't scary then
they're just messy
that's what'll take care of us
so when it was when the the baby horse found out that it was just very dirty it was time to
and what happened next
the mommy horse washed her
monstees
they're like like silly little monstees
right
yeah
and did they go away
yeah
no
what would make those monsters go away
wow
oh is that how is that how the monsters were fought away
oh no
be careful
okay
wow
what about the time that the baby horse became friends with the monsters
oh
and did they go away then
no
not yet
what pesky monsters
what really really really pesky monsters
they don't get it do they
they better go
okay
well tell me the rest of the story
go ahead
I can't believe these monsters won't leave
well after a while when the monsters wouldn't go away the mommy and the baby horse decided to ask the monsters some questions
and those questions were like
what what kinda questions did the did the mommy horse and the baby horse have for the monsters
what kind of questions
what did they ask
they said that they wanted to get to know these monsters so they say what's
what's your name
what's my name
my name is big monster
oh
and so the monster's name was big monster and the baby horse and the mommy horse wanted to know more so how old are you
I am fifty five

I would love to hear it
I don't know the story
you know the story about Scamp don't you
yes you can sweety
okay okay okay why don't I help you
how does it start
once upon a time
once upon a time there was
a little baby dog named Scamp
and his mommy and daddy were
they had names because they were they starred in a movie and they were called
yeah
Lady and Tramp
do you need a tissue Jilly
I think you do
it's looking to me like you need a tissue
go get a tissue from mom
please
a tissue would make that better
good job
okay
oh yeah great
oh right right right
so Scamp's mommy and daddy were
and the
Tra
the
Tra
that's right
and when Scamp was a little boy he used to like to
that's true
that's true to the story
they did huh
they went to Cathy's
oh no
and then what happened
what did they do
all right what are we waiting for now while you hide with me
what are we waiting for
really
really
and then the monsters didn't see him
no
oh wow
disappeared behind Cathy
oh really
and then what happened
oh dear
oh
you didn't like them huh
I'll tell you the truth
this story the one that you're telling I don't know it but it's a lot better than the one I'm
I like it
in the in the story I know about Scamp there weren't any monsters
but this one's very interesting
mhm
the one that I knew
all I knew was a story about Scamp who is a doggie who used to like to
I don't know it
but you're doing such a good job
what color was Scamp
what color was Scamp
was he red
was he black
no
let's see
no
I think he did
a red collar for his leash
I think so
I think you're right
and what else did he have
no he had a red collar
but he had
what did he use to hear
that's right and he had a
behind him what did he have
did he have a tail
well there you go
and what was his friend's name
hm
he had a lot of sisters
they all looked like his mommy Lady and he had a friend
and she was a girl
and she was really funny too
and she liked to run on the streets also
what was her name
her name was Angel if you remember
