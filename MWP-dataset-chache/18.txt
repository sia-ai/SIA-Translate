that's right
tell me the story Ross
tell me the story about the bird
what do you think about Count Dracula
he might afraid of you
he might scare you
really
horrible things
do horrible things to you sonny
count Dracula
even the count on Sesame Street would hurt little boys
not that one he's a cute count
he's not the real Count Dracula
the real Count Dracula is very bad

I think these seats are getting to hot for boys
I'm real tired
no
which one do you want

uh uh
very good Ross
what was it doing there Ross

what's wrong with him
why is he getting mad
and giving him bad instructions
where did you get that idea
uh huh
so what is the Hulk going to do
the Hulk doesn't eat people does he
I think he just throws things around Honey
right
right
how about that big bear
remember the big bear in Tarzan
mm hm
yeah
was he a bad bear
was he a bad bear
mm hm
right
and if we run into them we'll get real scared
cause they're very big
then he'll talk nice words and since they're animals animals always listen to Tarzan
cause Tarzan speaks the animal's language
he learned to do that when he was a little boy
cause he grew up in the jungle with a tiger family
mm hm
no
because the tiger took him for a baby
was it a tiger or was it an ape
anyway Tarzan grew up with the animals
when he was a baby he didn't have a mommy and a daddy
what do you want Mark
because he lost them early on
there was some kind of a problem
I think so yes
right
does that sound right
who wins between the two boys and the two parents
you win
well you know how to do that don't you
and what happens then Ross
which button do you push
what's it's name
right good
the little one that points with the arrow right
you went the wrong way didn't you
okay you should press the other one then
why did you push that chair over to the dresser
what do you mean
now what do you mean
say it again
yeah
what do I ask them
what
okay but what do I say in English to them
what do I want to know

well what we're going to do right now all the people who speak Dutch are gone now
they are not here today
they're all_gone
I don't know
they must have gone home
but they'll they'll come back tomorrow
and anyway right now we're going to go take a walk
there's no one here right now
no he just left his car here
yeah he just left his car here honey
that belongs to the company that doesn't belong to the man
he didn't buy it with his money
he didn't have enough money to buy it
he's poor
he doesn't earn that much money
he's not poor but he doesn't need a car you see
because he rides around on a bicycle
yeah
because he uses it in his work to get to work
now do the boys want to go on a walk with dad or not
okay well do you want to wear coats or not
coats
no coats
okay let's go guys
yeah this is true
he had picked up a big brick and people had told him that he was really strong
first they said
it's too big for you
they thought it was too big for you
but then you picked it up
what did we do on our walk Honey
tell me
tell Mommy the whole story
what did we do
what did we do
uh huh
said something to him in Dutch
where was he sitting
where was the boy sitting
where was he sitting
what does it mean

he was lying down on the ground
he was holding his leg
what what else did we do on the walk
yeah and what else
who else did we see on the walk
dog poo saw a_lot_of dog poo
what else did we do
no it wasn't a park but it was that big piece of the edging to the walk way sort of like a banister
what else did we do

what are you going to do
so what am I going to do in_order_to do that
yeah and then what
well it's not in the house where is it

where is it
I told you
tell you
dinner's ready
go eat your dinner
you mean Luxemburg
we have_to go from Holland which is right here all the way down to Luxemburg which is over here
that means we go through Belgium
then we take the plane all the way over the Atlantic over the big ocean to New York
then from New York over to Pittsburgh
okay so this is Pittsburgh
then I have_to go inside Pittsburgh and get to a garage
and in the garage I look inside the garage for a box and I look in the box to find some pictures
then what do I do
how's that
I don't understand
how do you do it
I don't understand
you're going to have_to tell me more exactly
what about Luxemburg
okay when I'm coming back what do I do
yeah
how do I get back here
I do
that's an interesting idea
what about Germany
I don't have_to go to to Germany
okay where do I get a car
where do I get a car
I can't take the car on the plane
you can't take cars up in planes
you mean down in Rumania
in Hungary yeah
yeah
well how do I get the car into the plane
okay so when I land how do I get a car
and what's the name of the place
on the sand speeder
you mean you want me to walk all the way from Luxemburg to Holland
do you know how long that would take to walk from Luxemburg to Holland
about seven days
you want me to walk for seven days
that's an awfully long time
honey
and I won't see you ever again
because when I come back you'll be gone
you'll be gone by then
because you'll be going back to Pittsburgh then
time to go home
no

is it in Holland or Germany
well Friday there's going to be one in Germany
over you remember when we went to Germany
at the same house
where the nice girls lived that you saw
those big girls that carried carried Marky on their shoulders
and then you went to see the football shoes in the store
at that house there's going to be a nice party on Friday

go to that zoo where the animals are
that'd be a better idea
when are we going to do that
I don't know
you ask her
what's that
I think you'd better talk to your Mommy about this
what do you want me to draw
say it again
why
you've got somebody's notes
yeah I picked up the wrong set of notes
I haven't asked yet no
I've got_to dry off a little bit
okay

because the Hulk doesn't have a shirt on doesn't wear a shirt
right what else
okay
do you want to open that door and make your daddy feel nice and and cool
okay hulk open the door
make the Hulk feel cool
okay
right
good good
it feels much better for the Hulk

they don't let the dogs do that on the street
they just don't
yeah
did you see him do it
that's not as bad
