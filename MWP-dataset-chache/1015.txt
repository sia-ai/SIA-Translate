okay

oh we're supposed to talk into the microphone
well I don't I doubt it
well she said if we had a pocket we should put it in our pocket but I don't have a pocket
so what should what's the best way to do it
I don't know
I mean I don't know how much it will pick up
well we'll just put the
I think you'd better not screw around with it now
I want to eat supper
well let's eat supper
just put it right here
well it may not be picking anything up
but I want to hear it

mhm you say it for me
well what should I say

I want to tell Matthew
I want to tell no no no don't touch that darling it'll turn it off
what do I want to tell me what to say
what should I say

deedeedeedeedeedeedeedeedledeedeedee
what are you looking at
to see if the tape is okay
I want to look
I want to hear some music on the tape
in a minute
okay
would you give me a hamburger with muffin
upbedoopiedoopiedoopadeedoop
want a muffin
mhm
we have_to be a little careful with that
that's alright
it's not a lot
here you go
of milk
I can hold it
ketchup
hi poop
nanope
hi this is Matthew
yes
shurietape
it's my thing
this is mine
mommy this is mine right
no we're borrowing it honey
from who
from one of my friends at school
Susie come eat
I'm making myself a little salad
too hot
might burn yourself
would you give me something to drink drink drink drinkie drinkie
where's your cup
I forgot
you forgot to set the table with your cup
yes
will you go get it please
it's all set
no I don't like these placemats
someone gave me the wrong kind of placemat
alright
which kind did you want
that kind
can we switch
yes
there
thank_you
anyway I think that Howard might have been kind of peeved but
about what
will you give me something to drink
you want Juicey_Juice
no
cranberry juice
I don't know if we have any cranberry juice
do we have cranberry juice
where's my other my other big one
will you put some cranberry juice in my cup
sure
Eric I'm going to turn this over
thank_you
no xxx
will you put a little more ketchup on my sandwich
okay
I think that for whatever reason Howard wanted Marty and it was really obvious that the students didn't
and he asked them if
that's right
okay
are you sure
yes
could I have the ketchup please
is this
what's
classified information
what's
alright
Susie
what's alright
is there dirt
well I suppose it is but I don't think
what's in my
what's okay mama
what's the study
it's on
mommy
language development
tell me what's okay
it's okay to talk when the tape recorder is on
mm good
it's a study about language development and they study like how often you would use what words with Matthew and how often he would use them
I don't think it's a very terribly
it's silly
I don't think it's a terribly well controlled study but
no neither are we
I just thought it would be interesting
and I really like this little gadget
what
I really like this little gadget
well you don't want that clipped on to just one person
you don't
not if all of us had to be picked up on the mike
I don't know
I mean I think you needed more instructions
well what Brenda said was
that I should just have it somewhere nearby so
anyway I don't see how Howard can ignore that kind of information
he asked them point+blank who they would like better and they did not hesitate
I think he was annoyed because as I was walking out the door he said it's really hard for you to let go of this program isn't it
and there was no reason for him to say that
so David is going to interview them both on Monday and then we'll decide
uhoh Pook you spill your juice
Matthew I'm so excited you're learning how to write
when did you learn how to write
I don't know
did you learn how at day care
do they teach you writing at day care
what
what
do they teach you writing at day care
unhunh
um
just learned how to do stop signs
at day care or at home
at day care
oh
there's a stop sign
make stop signs at day care
yes
is there one is there a stop sign at day care
it's on the door
ah
you got the xxx
but Matthew didn't write that one
no you didn't write that one did you honey
know what I think the cats did
ate the cheese they caught
I think so too
what do you think daddy
I'm afraid they did
arparpbeepbarppoop
anyway I'll just be glad when the whole business is settled
it's very nerve+wracking
should be settled by the middle of next week
but I wouldn't feel very good about having somebody that the students didn't feel all that comfortable with and didn't feel was approachable
how can Howard ignore that
well they didn't say she wasn't approachable just not as approachable in contrast
doing this training session was really fun too
I really like doing small groups training
they seem to really like it too
and they were really picking up their reflections very quickly
people are somewhat tuned to that kind of stuff
they really do grasp that concept very quickly
I'm eating dinner okay
excuse me
is that fun to do honey
the toaster just popped
what is this
trapezoid
oh this is that tape
I'm amazed
I looked through all the boxes
what does it say
magic
so she's all moved out
um
she's all moved out
mostly
all packed up
did you move stuff to Steve and Suzanne's too
no
will you give me another hamburger and muffin
is there
yes
a muffin for Matthew
yes I suppose there is
so what do you think of my spicy hamburgers
very good
what's in them
that Chinese chili and garlic paste
that's all
good
just take about half a teaspoon per hamburger and mix it really well
isn't it nice
are you sweaty
I was very pleased with myself
it looks like you're sweaty
I am
how did you
the spices make me sweat
because they're so hot
they always do
whenever it is that I eat spicy food I get very sweaty
I know you do
I get that with everything
oh sweetie
what are we going to make for Jens and Nancy
I was hoping Szechuan
I know but what
I don't know
we've only got one anyway that we really really liked and that's the the chicken
if we just try an experiment on a new one
nothing with bean curry
how about we give
xxx wasn't bad
how about we
the next day
ssh
how about we give them those berries some berries like the last time
that's an idea
berries
mhm
the kind that we get from the park that has no swings or anything or climbers
yes
the park downtown
yes
maybe we'll do that
would you like to help
uhhuh
I called Jens back and he wasn't home so I left a message on his tape recorder and said about three o'clock Sunday bring a salad
sounds good
what about that pork and potatoes recipe
I liked that
wasn't bad
it's heavier than the chicken
so
I'm not sure they mix well
well we don't have_to
it is novel
we don't have_to make the chicken
yes it makes a lot too and I really liked it
I'll think about it
it's going to be hard for Toby being stuck having students of Suzanne's all the time
yes
although I suppose if either of them drive us into town hitch a ride then we could watch
but then she'll be in town all day without a
true
a house
this is true
how is she doing
she didn't seem quite as gloomy today
as bloomy
oh gloomy
oh that's good
she feeling better
some
I guess
spilled your corn xxx
what weird weather
it was so nice today too
I know until I was almost done with work
a conversation to immortalize for posterity
think it will rain
might
I don't know
well it's supposed to be four hours on tape
Matthew carried a bag of groceries from the store to the car
he did
then he carried the bag again from the car into the house and he put them away
he did
all by yourself
and I threw the bag away because I couldn't fold it
and that
that's alright
just
that was very good
good for you sweetheart
but they forgot his back+pack at Chrissy's
uhoh
was there anything in it
um clothes
yeah well they were wet
he slept in them and they were wet
as I understand it he took off his shirt and cuddled with it all night when it got wet
you you cuddled your shirt
how come you wet the bed honey
I thought you weren't going to
that's why you didn't want me to send a diaper
what
that's why you said don't send a diaper because I'm not going to wet the bed
well I for I didn't I forgot that I was going to hold my pee in
aw did you forget
oh alright
good hamburgers
Matthew made his hamburgers himself too I just gave him a big pile of meat and he made burgers out_of it
he did
wow that's great
I told him he wanted to have spaghetti and I said we'd have burgers tonight so you could make lasagna for tomorrow
right
well I didn't I have ground turkey I unfroze
sausage
I didn't unfreeze the sausage
I should have I should
I could
well even I bought you I bought extra Mozarella and Ricotta because I wasn't sure how much you'd want to make and whether they'll make it big enough
yes I just thought that would be a nice thing to
oh definitely
then you're thinking about what's in more casseroles
you know what
those
what
broken up ones aren't very good anymore
those broken up what
lasagna springs
you don't like the broken up ones
no
they're too hard to xxx and they just broke up again
so you really need long long ones that are still mixed
then they're good
then if it
mommy
yes
I want to put my thing back
well if you finish up your hamburger we can have some ice cream
but I want to put back the thing okay

he did
he did
where did where did he sleep
right in the bed
the same bed with you and Mossy
will you turn this off
do you know why I have it on
because somebody at Cornell where I work is making a study of how children like you learn how to talk
so it will help other children learn how to talk
probably nothing that useful
maybe not
but why did she she give it to me
to to this house
we got a letter from McHugh_Matt today
