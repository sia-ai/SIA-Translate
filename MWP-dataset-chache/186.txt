when you were a little tiny baby the first thing I ever gave you to eat was baby oatmeal
and it came in a little tiny box like this
and you only had a little table spoonful
you eat a lot more than that now
I know
it was too hard for me too
I think that maybe we're not supposed to open it
that's why it's so hard
okay do you need some help

we probably should clean up some of these toys
would you still like to hear a story
Nanette

I don't
those don't open
that's why
those are just made out_of wood
and they're just pr they're just toys
you can pretend to open them
what're you doing
would you like me to read you this story while you're playing with the milk bottles
okay I can come sit with you
cause I'd like to see
I didn't get a chance to look at this book cause when you were reading it you went so quickly
it's called The_great_cat_chase
and it's by Mercer Mayer
it doesn't have any words though
we'll have_to make up the words as we to along
here's some words though
let's not see what those words say and see if we can make up a story ourselves
okay once upon a time there was a little girl named
Tumpty
who took her baby kitty named
named Puddy for a walk in the carriage
and as Tumpty and Puddy were going along Tumpty stopped to pick some
what did she pick over here
and Puddy jumped right out_of the carriage
and what did he do
he did what
he rided on a bicycle
well maybe he rided on a bicycle and then hided behind a tree
and look what happened to Tumpty
she got very upset
what do you think she was yelling
I don't see Puddy that's right
and there she went running along the street until she came to
what's ha who's Happy
do you know what Happy is
can you tell by what he's wearing what he might be
he's wearing a hat
he looks like somebody in one of the books that we have at home
Peter the Policeman
remember
well we can call him Happy the Policeman what is he blowing
yeah and he's stopping the traffic here
and who comes along
what's he riding
right with pedals
just like your tricycle
and there they go oh what did they see
there's Puddy again
do they look happy
I see
maybe that's why the policeman was named Happy cause he helps people find things
okay so they went over to Puddy
and what did they say
what did she yell
what did she yell to the kitty cat
the boy's angry
he certainly looks angry
did she tell the cat that
what happened to Happy the Policeman
hm I see
and he found him and then what happened
look at this
what did he do
he ran to the what
to the mirror
hm that looks like a mirror
you're right
looks like a big round mirror
okay so Puddy ran to the mirror
and oh look what they're doing
they're doing this with their fingers
do you know what that means
when Mommy does that to you what does it mean
it means
come here
yeah
come here kitty
oh you know it isn't a mirror
I don't know
did you know this is a tunnel
you see
there's a big hole and it goes through here and it comes out this side
and it's a tunnel
yeah
and that's what Puddy did
Puddy ran through the tunnel
what are what's Happy and and Tufty
ls that the woman's the little girl's name
Tufty
I don't remember
and the little boy
what are they going to do
they're gonna climb up the mirror
okay actually they're climbing through a tunnel
because see here if it were a mirror they couldn't get through the other side
and here they are
they came right through again
uh oh
where's Puddy going
looks like he's climbing a mountain doesn't he
just like you
we're gonna go mountain climbing on Saturday
Daddy's gonna carry you in the pack again
okay do you wanna see the rest of this story
okay let's see what happens here
what do you think is happening now
oh looks like everybody's getting into trouble
they're falling into the water
what happened
they're tickling
they look like they're tickling
they're all tangled up
but look where Puddy goes do you know what
he went right back into the tunnel again
I don't know about that Puddy
he's a real trouble+maker
the little imp
just like you
right
he's very impy
he goes right through here
and uh oh
look what happened
did you see
he is going up a tree
he better hurry up and get up there because I think everybody's kinda mad by now
he's really giving them a big chase oh okay and look at him up the tree
can you climb up a tree
how do you climb up a tree
let me see
just like that
yeah
maybe when we go home we'll find a little tree to climb up
what
for you
it's kinda like climbing up the stairs of the slide
do you wanna see what happens to Puddy
okay let's see what happens
this looks like the policeman is going to get him for good
uhoh
look what happened to the branch
it got broken
the bough broke
remember that song that we sang
when the bough breaks
that's what that's what is looks like when a bough breaks
it comes right off like that
it snaps off
mhm

because they were so heavy on the branch
and uh oh
