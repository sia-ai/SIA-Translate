yes
I don't think so
well nothing might happen
I just didn't think you'd like to have a kitty
what are you singing about
okay
they won't fall out
because the door isn't wide enough
no I said wide enough but big enough is the same
you ate the snake up
was he good
oh in the bunkhouse
what did you do
yes turtles crawl
yes snakes crawl
I guess they walk yes
I really don't know Adam if you want to be so specific
I think so
that's something from last time
when you were playing upstairs
I don't remember what was in it
why don't you let one of the Joes drive
is this Joe
oh this is terrific
Joe terrific
and the other one he says is just Joe
perhaps the other Joe would be a better driver
he was in your truck
I don't know
could he sit beside him
he can ride in something else

you either use the chalk or the crayon
on the other side
where's the eraser
are you sitting on the eraser
now do you want to wipe that off
all of it
and then draw some more
no that doesn't go in with the crayons
oh if you wish
like that one
that's not really a ship is it
what is that

just like you use the crayons
what're you looking for Adam

you were just joking
you can hang it up on your wall
you can keep it
that's for you
yes that's part of it
if you look down at the bottom of the bag there's something there for Paul
this is for Paul she said
I didn't hear you ask her if you could open that
yes
goodness what do you think those are
wheels
oh what do they go on
so you can tick it
I don't hear it ticking
I don't know

isn't that fun
well why don't you see what you need for it first
that's a dairy
that's the dairy
no that
what is that
I can't read them right now

you need to put the wheels under both holes
on the other side too
the other side now
yes
put it in the hole
this isn't a doggie
mhm
why
there's another truck
yes you missed it
yes just like the other ones
now you have_to lead the trucks
all those little things there
well I don't know
what do you think they might be
hm
boxes of what
they seem to don't they
well that's not really a clock is it
just the dairy products around here
see the eggs the milk the butter
I guess you could read that and it will tell you what those things are
he said I want that
I don't know
he sees something back there that he would like to have
you don't have any milk on that truck
the truck you're driving
yes they seem to don't they
I don't know
you find out
that's right
now why don't you put some butter on the truck
what about some milk
yes that's milk
I'd like four quarts of milk
now how're you going to put it on there like that
four quarts of milk and two pounds of butter
okay Mr Milkman
I'm waiting for my four quarts of milk and my two pounds of butter and my two dozen eggs
and if you can't bring it I'll just have_to get another milkman
no you don't have what I ordered
I said four quarts of milk
where's the milk
do you have four of those
no you don't do you
how do you think they go on the truck so they won't tip over
they might spill like that
yes I think I'm going to have_to get another milkman
I don't want any butter that might fall off the truck
but you don't have what I asked for
you've got the two dozen eggs on properly

oh I'm sorry
I guess so
are these things to ride on at the nursery school
what kind of things
wagons
do they
how do you ride on them then
you go to nursery school
yes I think they do have wagons but I think they're stored because they can't take them outside
because there's too much snow
you don't know where your dozen be
your dozen what
do you paint at school
do you paint
I don't know
I don't go to nursery school
you go to nursery school
you told me you painted and you told me you did what else with your hand
didn't you paint those things that you made in clay
no
I don't know
I wasn't there
yes I take you there but I don't stay
just a little while
do you sing songs Adam
you do
you mean when you're having your lunch
what else do you sing
do you have lunch there Adam
that's very nice
I need some milk for the little children at my school
you'd better get two trucks for all the milk at the school
yes
the man who called this morning
can I have five quarts of milk for the school children
what
oh she's a nursery school teacher
you can't
is the road blocked
is the road blocked
you can't have that
the cord
because he doesn't need it
yes
oh he just took a little nap
no
how much butter do you think the children might need
only one butter
that won't be enough
I think I still need more milk
I need more than that for twenty children
don't you have another truck
thank_you
that's still not enough
Adam will you say one two three four
you say it
oh yes
that's alright
something's sticking out on the tape recorder
what do you think it is
do you have a Harvard shirt on
what
oh the dresser is hurting your head
why are you putting your head on the dresser
does it still hurt you
it what
Adam maybe you can use these
you have some
where
what colors do you have
red and blue
anything else
hm
well it'd be nicer to leave the box there and just take them out_of the box
if you leave the box there then we'll know where it is
alright
would you get your handkerchief please
what did you see on television last night
did it have a lion in it
did it have a scarecrow in it
did it have a wizard in it
that's right
can you
I don't think so
it's glued on there isn't it
do you know why those people wanted to go see the wizard
you don't know
you don't know why
they each wanted the wizard to do something
do you know what the lion wanted
handle it very gently
you can open one end
yes you open it
now let's see
the stick
attach rubber
we have_to attach it to this little hook
I'm taking out the tail part
I think you can take this piece out too
really
alright Adam
take this piece off very carefully
these we put into here
these are wings and we're putting them into the clip
mhm
no
this is the wing
and another wing
I'm taking the end off
then they can attach by themselves
we're putting this clip onto the stick so it will go like an airplane
it's not easy
no it's not so easy
oh I see it did
now you turn the propeller many times
okay let's try it
you try it
now hold it up in the air and let go
it's a Sky_Dart
the same way you put it together
oh no
why don't you leave it together
oh a bit more
a Sky_Dart
Paul Adam's talking to you
do it more until it's tight
no it doesn't have wheels
sometimes
well it's not a regular airplane
it's what you call a Sky_Dart
that's why the wings aren't straight
hm
see Paul
mhm
thank_you
he didn't give me anything
I took some paper from him
I took it from him
the tail
the rudder
no
which part don't you like
alright
you can have it straight
wind it many times
that makes it fly
that's right
well don't hold the rubber band
because then you keep it from turning
no
no no don't let Paul get it
that's right
well he likes it but he doesn't know how to handle it carefully
you aren't holding the rubber band are you
it turns too
see how the band is being twisted
the wings don't turn do they
what are those
I thought you said that was a propeller
no it was right but it fell on its tail
on a caboose
what kind of caboose
you need to hold it up like this
thank_you
I guess when it hits the floor it hits so hard that it falls off
mhm
I heard it
that's the place to attach the dart to the propeller
no
why
it thought your arm was a tree
why did it think that
you didn't hold it up high enough
first you wind it many times
then you hold it here and here and let go
Paul wouldn't know what to do with an airplane
I don't think I would Adam because it's not very strong
you won't cut your finger what
oh yes when it snaps
that's a strong rubber band
oh did it break
not in that but people get in real airplanes don't they
it doesn't fly all by itself
you help it by turning the propeller
I just don't think that Paul is interested
where
are there any children
oh
you made it
who made it
oh you made one
mhm
a little boy named George
and he had a sister named what
no Tony was the little baby
his sister's name was what
the little girl
her name is Sheila
Sheila
careful Adam you may break your airplane
mhm
your Sky_Dart
the what
you don't
well are you being very very careful with it
it fell on that on that part Adam
those are bright tone crayons
careful
pick the one you dropped on the floor up
what do you think that is
they're all black
I'm asking you
no they aren't all black
yes I think that's black
no the paper is
some of the paper is black
