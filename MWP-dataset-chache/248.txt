what's your favorite animal to ride on
a horsie
remember we went to the zoo
and there was a merry+go+round at the zoo
and it had all different sorts of animals
it had lions and it had horses
I don't know what their merry+go+round at Golden_Gate is like
and maybe we'll go to the tea garden

let's find some new shoes for you
do you know where your new shoes are
they would look nice with this
do you know where they are
maybe in here
oh would you like to wear these shoes
they're at Nola's I bet
let's put these brand new ones on
because you know what
the red matches the red on your sweater
the red shoes matches the red design
see the red design on your pants
what should we take along
is that what you wanna hold in the park
well we can't we shouldn't probably take the toys into the park
but you can take them in the car and hold them in the car
so I have_to wear white shoes
well we don't have any white shoes but we have red shoes
I think these'll be okay don't you
but you have_to remind me to stop at Nola's house and get all the clothes that are there
I sure left a_lot_of clothes over there
there we go
no I wanna see you
I think we should make him dance
crickets like to dance
okay in a few minutes
Elizabeth is busy right now
I'm going to play with this
but just here
would you like to play with it too
Nonno sent this to you
we have_to be very careful
we have_to keep this doll up there
the baby's in her arms
what do you think that is
she's all dressed up and she has ear+rings on her ears
to look pretty
well I guess she's probably going to go dancing
do you like that red dress
that's the prettiest dolly I've ever seen
hm
those are red shoes like you have
what color shoes do you have
well she has red shoes on too
let me see
do you think that no those are shoes
but you know what happened
some of the paint has come off and so her toes are coming through
that's what happened
she we should keep her in this box
but you can take her out and give her some tea if you want
I bet she would like that
it isn't
why
uhoh careful that's a pin
it's a hat pin
or hair+pin to keep her hair in place
no that's an ear+ring
this is a pin to hold her hair in place
is it sharp
on the other ear
the needle is to hold her hair
you know sometimes you put your hair up in a bun
then you have_to put something around it
to keep it up
otherwise it could fall down
does she have bangs
what does she have
that's a pin and it matches her ear+rings
look at her pretty eyes
they open and shut
little blue eyes
that's a pin
a decoration
oh lemme see
I think it's just stuck on
I think the only thing with a sharp pin is her hair+pin
that's a hair+pin
and that's her hair
it's a bun
that's another hair+pin
there isn't one
only there
what is she wearing
let's try to see
