but for cakes it's actually c not k
see that begins with letter c
that's the word cakes
but you're right kuh sometimes is made by letter k
let's see
what else do we want here
yeah I've
see these stickers we could probably put them where they belong instead
hey and I see the color red which was on that page where the balloon is
hold on to this sticker
and I tape it off and give it to you
okay do you remember there was a page
where the color red
yes
what letter do you think red begins with
very good Naima
let's see
and there was something about an ice cream cone
right

that word down there is cone
cone begins with C too
this is a little
train
truck
you're right I said the wrong thing didn't I
um okay
I'm looking to see if there are any other blue words
I think mostly we're done with that part
because I think we've xxx
uh fire truck
oh maybe that's is that a fire truck
but that's a green truck
that's not a fire truck
hm
you know what we could put these other stickers on a plain piece of paper and we could write a story and use the stickers
would you like to do that
um okay
well this isn't part of the story
I can read the story if you want
alright
Arthur's Lost Puppy
what's that noise
Arthur and D_W took baby Kate to the street fair
Pal came along too
there was lots to do
Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
that went around and around
D_W got her face painted
look Kate she said
I'm a cat
but Kate was looking at something else
suddenly Kate began to cry
are you hungry asked Arthur
here's your bottle
but Kate did not want her bottle
wa wa wa she cried
do you have a wet diaper asked D_W
but Kate's diaper was dry
and still she cried
wa wa wa
um
Arthur lifted the baby from her stroller
he rocked her in his arms
he tickled her tummy
he made funny faces but still she cried
wa wa wa
Kate loves ice cream says Arthur
run to the store D_W
and get a
get her a cone
because these are stickers that don't really belong here
we can use them for something else
let's see
D_W tied Pal's leash to a bench
and went into the store
a clown with balloons walked by
Pal barked at him
woof woof woof
when D_W came out of the store Pal was gone
she looked up and down the street
that dog is trouble
she cried
and she ran to tell Arthur
oh no cried Arthur why would Pal run away
maybe he's mad at you said D_W
you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers
Arthur said nothing
he just looked very sad
but Kate had a_lot to say
wa wa wa wa she cried
then Arthur said D_W take Kate home maybe she needs a doctor
and I need to find Pal he began calling
here Pal here Pal
here Pal here Pal
Arthur passed the ring toss table the bob for apples table and a table with pumpkin pies chocolate cakes and cookies
he wished there was a table with hamburgers
Pal would be sure to be hanging around it
have you seen a lost puppy Arthur asked the police officer
a lost puppy said the officer
yes one was taken to the
is that the police station
to the school
let me see
yep
one was taken to the school
oh thank you said Arthur and he ran to the school
but the lost puppy was not Pal
Arthur sadly walked home
back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
crash
down he went
and as he fell he let go of his balloons
then
guess what
a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings with his teeth
do you wanna blow your nose
the balloons rose higher and higher
over the
roofs
over the
trees and up up up they went
and so did Pal
look someone shouted
a flying puppy
a flying puppy
do puppies have wings Naima
what has wings
puppies do
puppies don't
you wanna nurse
um okay
and
then suddenly bang pop bang the balloons hit a tall tree
one by one they burst
Pal floated slowly down
when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
and one was all he needed
to make baby Kate happy
um
um
oh my pumpkin
yeah okay
uh
is that a good snack you're having
is it yummy
would you like some fresh banana too
okay
you could have some plain yogurt if you want

you could
alright
hm
more blueberries
and wheat germ

cold

in a sippy cup or in a bottle
yes or no

oh
I know exactly what you're talking about and there's a picture of
a boy peeing standing up that way too in the book
mhm

yep sometimes boys and men can stand up to pee
and they don't have_to wipe their bottoms
and you've seen
you've seen Daddy do that when he takes you to the Y_M_C_A for swim class
xxx what friend is behind the tissue box
oh it's Mr Grizz

what's the matter with him
running away
because he was so sick you mean
oh he was too sick to climb trees
that's pretty sick for a bear

raccoons can climb trees though
I
see yeah so I dunno
some
not all birds build their nests in trees though some birds build their nests in the grass
or in the sand
at the beach
or some of them even build their nests in houses
like in the little spot up there
xxx I see a yellow jacket nest right there
I think those yellow jackets moved their house over here
xxx right there
now that I'm looking at that I can see there's a little yellow jacket home
you wanna get down now honey
it's hard to see from here it's camouflaged but I'll show you next time we go outside

you already found them
you can have them out of this bowl if you want
it's a colander you're right
it's a strainer
I'm gonna put this here okay
are they good grapes
that's good
cause it's a xxx xxx transmitter
without having it bother you
if you're walking around it would be a good idea to uh
to wear it and put the transmitter in it
you could carry Olivia and the transmitter in it
is she too little to have a transmitter
mhm
well um you know Amanda and Katherine sent us that for the transmitter but I think they wouldn't mind if Olivia also rides in it
Olivia might actually enjoy riding on top of the transmitter
what do you think
she might
she could stand on top of it in the little pouch
that might be fun
but we'll we'll get that in a little bit
we're going to cook some things now
after
you can have your snack
that's fine
you could put rags away for me in a minute too
that's fine you can just eat
it's fine
um what am I doing
I'm making saag which means I have_to wash a big bowl full of
mustard greens
that kind of a vegetable is called mustard greens
one in
hanging in the bag there
that's what that is
well I need to put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely
to make sure that the mustard greens get very clean cause we're going to cook them and eat them
cause they don't taste very good if you don't cook them
I think they're kind of bitter
I think they taste bitter
bitter is a flavor
lemme think if you've tasted anything bitter
I think you have tasted something bitter but I'm trying to think of what it was
you know what you had that was a little bit bitter
do you remember once I think you ate some brie cheese
when we went to Prodigal Son in Hyannis
and Mommy got some brie cheese and some fruit on a plate to eat
I think that you tried it and I think you actually liked it
but that flavor was a bitter flavor
well I don't really want this shirt to get messy cause this is a shirt that I like
and I'm gonna do some cooking
adjust this a bit
today is November
Thursday November fourteenth

I'm gonna get the bowl
do you remember that
it was quite a while ago
he likes to go there to get coffee sometimes
he likes their coffee the way they make coffee there
xxx he just does I think
I think he thinks it has a good flavor
I think he thinks the coffee that they make at Prodigal Son has a good flavor
well you'd have_to ask Daddy
he's the one who knows why
Daddy's friends xxx
xxx okay you asked me what bitter is right
xxx if you taste that and chew it for a while you'll see what bitter means
the flavor of that is bitter
actually it's also spicy so you might not like it
why don't you take it out
those are spicy greens
ooh we're gonna have spicy food tonight
do you like spicy food
do you think xxx likes spicy food

oh no it's the same one
the neighbors' yard
yeah I bet he will
oh where'd he go
did he xxx in front of the neighbors
oh there he is again xxx
look at him wiggling his tail

why do they make their tails move like that
hello

cause that's a really nice play+ground and we don't go there very often
but we could go there with him
if it's raining hard then we'll probably do something different but we'll do something with xxx
did you hear me leave that message for his mommy
when we were in the car
yeah if it's raining we might do that
I didn't say yes I said maybe
because I need to talk to her about it first and that's only if it's not

the ladder that you thought was stairs
what toys did you see there
a felt board yep
you took your transmitter off
oh my gosh
you want me to clip it on
it it works kind of like a um clothes+pin
you squeeze those
except it's really harder than a clothes+pin
you could actually really pinch yourself if you aren't careful
so I'd rather that you left it on cause
you know why cause we're taping right now
xxx Naima that's not to play with though okay

that's like a joke
Tozy very good yes
alright I'll write it down
one second and I'll write it down
you mean like the name of the cat in Mrs McCats
Tozy

so there
well it's just kind of a mean thing to say that's all
well I think you're eating the y
I think you're eating the y Naima
hello Michaela
is that what Henry the hippo says to Lars the polar bear
who are you and why are you so white
I often wonder that myself
yes
mm it's a good question
it's a good question
oh my gosh I do have an apron on
do I look a little bit like a polar bear
wearing an apron like this
I guess I must
mm
I have an idea about what's scary
I think there is something scary in here
I think it's a little girl who's scary
it's not a little girl
what could it be then
oh my gosh a bear
yikes
yikes
the bear is demanding salmon
oh brother
bah
I will give you some salmon
do you want some
I happen to have some right here for bear emergencies
I also have bear food for bear emergencies
it might be a little bit spicy why don't you try it
you've had it before
it's the same kind you had the other day
I think you liked it
it's salty but I think you liked it
cause you ate it
that's how I could tell
you actually ate it
um it actually has salt in it
that kind of salmon
smoked salmon
that's just what it's called
cause it's been smoked
that means it's been cooked in a certain way
using some salt
and some smoke I think
okay big noise coming
watch out cause I'm gonna use this
close your ears if you need to
it's not
it's the Cuisinart noise
mm okay
I'm done doing that
oops
sag
are you still eating the salmon and the cookies
you're xxx
I see
okay
xxx you can let me know when you're done
I'll give you something else fun to do
oh
do you want to get down play in the living+room or do you want me to give you something fun to do here
okay
uh just a minute
I have_to get it
he did what
he fixed the toast tongs
yeah we'll look for the wood glue later
okay
he did
I see okay
oh
right to the end no
okay
these are walnuts with the shells still on them
I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into
or you could actually put them into the ice+cube tray
in fact you could do
are they too big for that container
okay
mm okay I think you're right
so why don't we use this other ice+cube tray
we'll take these out
and you can actually
I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve
yeah
I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin
because this has got twelve
and the ice+cube tray also has twelve
does it
three four five xxx oops
xxx that has a different number actually
that's alright though
why don't you put them
you can just put them wherever you want okay
this isn't like the sponges where you make them all go in the same
these are different kinds of nuts
you can practice putting them in there
whoops
whoops whoops whoops okay
taking the nuts out
there you can take them out with your fingers
that's another walnut
that's an almond
actually you know I'm not sure
I think it's a Brazil nut
but I'm not positive about that
I think it's a Brazil nut
let me see
I think that's a hazel nut
there are lots_of different kinds of nuts
that's a hazel nut
just a second
xxx I'll look in a second
just a second
let's see
show it to me
I think that's a hazel nut
I think that's another hazel nut
just a second honey
the ice+cube tray has more than twelve and the muffin tin has twelve places for twelve muffins
xxx and I need some salt
just a second honey
let me see
oh
well I'm not sure
I don't remember
that's something we're gonna have_to look up
usually when I buy nuts they already have the shells taken off of them
what you have there are the nuts with the shells still on
they have_to be broken to be eaten
let's see
that one I'm not sure
you're right it is
those are the same
they match don't they
you have matching
do you wanna match match the different nuts and the different kinds
why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the nuts that look alike xxx with the dark brown in that container
no I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here put all the ones that look like that
oh you've kind of already sorted them for yourself
I see
xxx if you want to do that
you don't have_to do that
I was just suggesting that you sort practice sorting
they're too hard for your teeth to chew them
they're just too hard
it would break your teeth if you tried to
crack them
but a bird or let's see some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it
people don't have teeth as strong as some animals' teeth
they just don't
a bird with a really strong beak might be able to crack that
I don't really know for sure
cause I don't know everything and I don't know everything about every kind of bird
I only know some things about some kinds of birds
oh dear I think I've forgotten what a chickadee eats
xxx definitely eats some seeds
I think chickadees do eat insects
if I'm not mistaken
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor
okay
do you wanna help me make some cookies
do you need to use the potty love
okay
alright
um do you wanna help make cookies
okay
let's see to do that you will need definitely to wash hands
why don't you put all the nuts
let's put all the nuts in one container and save them
I think we'll save them in a good
how many are there
let's see
let's put all the nuts in a yogurt container
why don't you put them all in there and then
whoops
and then I will help you put the top on it
Daddy especially
yeah I think you're right
Mommy does too
cause it makes the food taste good
whoa
that sounds great
you made a musical instrument
you want another yogurt container
you could make two of those musical instruments
you put some more nuts in here then you could make another musical instrument
it's like a shaky a shaky yogurt container
not a shaky egg but a shaky yogurt container
whoops
here you go
you wanna put the other nuts in the other one
whoa
xxx the top wasn't on
alright shall I help you put the top on more securely
are you making one or two of these
okay
okay
let's put all of them in then
here's some more nuts
let me see this
let me see
there try that
you know what it sounds a little different every time you put more or less nuts in it
xxx that'll sound different
that one will sound empty I bet
xxx but you know what might sound different if you put something really small in there like some of your beans
let's put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like
and close it close it up real tight
there
that does sound different
the nuts
nuts
who says nuts
does a squirrel say that
nuts
what did I put in here

whoop
oh this mixing bowl is very heavy

you found the butter
well it's not for playing with
I didn't know you had it
it's for cooking with

does it feel interesting on your hands
you wanna build something with butter
uh well let's see
when we make the cookie dough I'll let you build something with cookie dough
how's that
alright
when we make the cookie dough
oh_my_goodness yes you did have the butter
I didn't know you had the butter
butter is food it's not actually a toy but I will
I will let you play with some cookie dough after we make the dough okay
but we need to make the dough first
you want me to help you put the top on that
oh
okay you're gonna need to pick
get on the floor and pick those up okay
no
you can put these in here first but then you need to go pick the other nuts up
I'll help you get down
and you need to put them away or play with them in the living+room
I don't want them on the floor there
I'm gonna count to ten then you're gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor
do you need help getting down
I don't mind if you shake it but I want you to pick up the nuts that are spilled on the floor too
you can shake it
you can have it to shake after you pick up the other nuts
you're having Ring_Around_the_Rosy at the dance party
here put your other nuts in there
and then I'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts
you're collecting nuts just like a squirrel does
and then I will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to
yeah this is some food that I'm picking up off the floor not the nuts
you're doing a good job picking those up Naima
there's one there
and there's some up on the table too
wanna get those
you want me to help put that on then you could shake it
okay
I guess we're gonna turn off the tape
okay
that's just the date that's the number of the day
everyday has a number
I'm gonna switch mikes with you
and today's Tuesday isn't it
what did you
you could have gone to music together today but you decided you didn't wanna go
um because you wanted to be with me
instead
and I had to have a conference call
that's why
you need to have some more of your lentils before you get more yogurt

I put some hot red pepper on it xxx
do you want it to be spicier
you want black pepper in it
you want paprika in it

which do you want or do you want juicy water
okay
