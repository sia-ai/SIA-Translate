okay
listen to a story
okay can you see the pictures
this this story is called The_great_cat_chase
it's about some people who chase a cat
she did read it
oh gee I never heard this story before
but here's a woman pushing a a carriage
a baby carriage with a cat in it
what a silly thing to do
oh maybe it's a little girl dressed up to be a mama
think so
I think so too
well she went to pick a flower right here
one of these pretty red flowers
and the cat jumped out
oh oh
she put her hands up and said
oh oh
where's my cat
he was hiding behind this tree
she couldn't find him
she was really upset because he jumped away and she couldn't find him and she didn't know where he was
there he is hiding
she didn't know it
well she st she started to look for the cat
she didn't see it
but she saw a policeman so she thought she'd ask for some help
help she said
my cat is lost
you see the policeman
hmm
well the policeman said
there's you cat lady right over there
oh there he is she said
I'll just go get him
and the policeman went to get the cat but the cat ran away
and now
you know how we sometimes go to pat the cats and they run away
well but she wanted her cat back
so they started to chase the cat
he ran and they ran after him
then he ran into this pipe
like a big tunnel
so the policemen crawled into the pipe
the cat was already at the other side
and then when the policeman came out the cat ran up the hill
oh and then the policeman helped the the lady get out_of the pipe
and they fell down
oh_my_goodness
they're pretty clumsy aren't they
yep
think they're gonna catch that cat
yeah
oh_my_goodness
they fell into a puddle
looks pretty compromising to me
they're all wet
look at them
they have wet hair
and then the cat jumped back in the pipe and went out the other way
oh_my_goodness
then they ran into the pipe and crawled through
oh look at that
the little boy caught the cat
well the cat jumped right up on the policeman
and and jumped on his head
and then ran up a tree
he's a pretty hard cat to catch isn't he
and now the the cat is up in the tree
oh look at them pointing
and the policeman climbed up the tree trying to catch the cat
which he did
he caught him right there
and now what's gonna happen
oh oh
the policeman is falling and the cat is falling
well the cat fell into the lady's arms
and the policeman fell right on his head
what happened here
nothing
oh now the child is in the baby carriage
and the cat is walking right with them
oh look what happened
the lady went into the house
and she changed her clothes and when she came out it turns out that she was a nurse
now she's gonna fix up the policeman because he really got hurt when he fell out_of that tree
and that's the end of the story
