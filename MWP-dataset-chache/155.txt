so you'll be taller and
how big and strong do you want to be
and bigger and bigger
how big are you going to be
uh oh
do you know what that might've been
that might've been a little boy who tried to cross the street without looking
and a car at the last minute slammed its brakes on and came to a stop just in time
did you tell Dad what we did today
who'd we see
remember
who
did we see Michael
Michael told me he was going to to work
oh
actually Michael didn't come till this afternoon
was Mike at the beach
no
that's because he had to work too
mhm
just a little bit
do you remember the name of the beach you went to
hm
you don't remember it this time
it was Winger what
Winger Beach
Winger Sheek Beach
that's the one
is that gonna be enough done for you
mm
and if we go at the other end come back and start that way
xxx that looks very rare
that looks better
yeah
why why don't you start that way and I think it will cook more or less this I can eat myself
I can eat that
I can eat that
I'll put it back except I'm just nervous that it will turn out to be so overdone you won't like it
hm
did he manage t to remember what he had done
yeah
did you go swimming Charlie
you did
you did
did you wear water wings
no
it wasn't very deep was it Charlie
she got the big boat
yeah
where'd she get the big boat
big row boat
oh xxx
did she take you for a ride
you wanted to go back with your Mom
but she took me for a ride
yeah
she's very strong
why didn't you go for a ride with Sabina
you wanted to go back to the car
I see
he got a little nervous
mhm
it's a terrific place to go though cause they have a_lot_of tide and so you can get in the canoe and it takes you right out
mm hm
but it's not a canoe actually it's a row+boat
mhm
oh the tide's going out and it takes you out
the tide's going out it takes you out in a great rush
and then how do you get back
and then you xxx
I see
you did
did you drive her
there was also a mat too
wasn't there Charlie
a mat is that thing you lie on in the water
it's not a boat
remember
it's a raft
it blows up
it looks sorta like a boat
remember
well
well that's
you used that
that was better for Charlie
well
the whole place was so good
cause there're all sorts of little pools around you
yeah
but low tide was at one or something like that right
I guess you're right because there when we got_to the beach there're incredible green+heads everywhere
but by the time we got_to the beach there was um there was pools of water and leftover spaces and stuff like that and you could look for sand+dollars that just washed up
mhm
mhm
Charlie didn't look for sand+dollars
you mean you went to the ocean beach because there was green+heads on the back
mhm
yeah
I see
mhm
mhm
at at which other pool
the big pool or the little pool
ahhah
which one did you like the best
hm
the little one
was the how was the water
was it cold
hm
you were digging a hole
that's right
and do you remember your lips turned blue
lips turned blue
very cold
remember that
that's what little boys are for during the summertime
you put them in the water until they turn blue
without that summer is not complete
poor Sabina kept looking at Charlie as we as Judy and I oohed and aahed over Charlie's blue lips and Sabina kept saying
are mine blue
hopefully
nothing was happening to Sabina
she looked just fine
she's too tough
she is
she's tough and older too
quite right
she showed Charlie a bunch of of uh comic books and
hum
Charlie kept saying to me
read to me Mom
read to me
and they were all in German
mhm
Sabina carefully would read them to him in German
uhhuh
Charlie would never say a word keep right on looking along
she had a Tom and Jerry comic didn't she
in German
yep
wow
great
everything was in German
say Charlie try this
you don't want to
do you know what it is
it's a London Broil
and you've never had it before
that's delicious Charlie
that's like steak
look I'm having the same thing and it's delicious
mm
a little protein
what I meant to say to you earlier about um Mike and Judy was that they said xxx
I said that conceivable we would bring Sabina here for the night and then they would take us in the morning to see the tall ships
what morning was that
Saturday morning at eight
but we'll do that when we get her
when we supposed to
ah
um
they have a place to go and look at
mhm
and um
where's that
it's a warehouse on the wharf
mm
the information I'm beginning to pick up is that what
they're coming in Thursday or something and they will make a pass by the aquarium
mhm
coming in maybe Saturday to
make the pass by the aquarium
yeah
and then next
that's when
yeah and that's when the big public weekend display
but it's not clear whether they'll have the sails up or not
next Thursday is when they take off again for Europe or where ever they're going with their sails set and what have you
I got you
and Boise_and_Blanket which is the travel agency that we use at work has
ah
some kind of exclusive arrangement at on a bunch of ah harbor tour+boats
ah xxx
and for twenty five bucks a throw they will toot you out
take you along
to the uh into the mouth
taking you
of the harbor and the outer harbor as these guys sail out
hey
that's a good idea
why not
that's gravy
let's just leave it
let's just leave it where it is okay
you can taste it if you want but let's not le lean over and get it that way
right
want a little of that
you don't have_to have it
but I don't want you reaching for it thanks
what do you say
you betcha
that sounds like a better deal except for the twenty five bucks a throw
mhm
this is distinctly on land and I'm not sure we can do it
mhm
but I would really like to see them at some time
mhm
and it seemed like it was possibly the only time we would get a chance
mhm
what that means xxx
off to a very early start
assume you leave at
a tiny bit
that's okay
I'm not sure the ships are even going to be doing anything until midday
hey you gotta be careful
can you you know how to hold your glass
hi

and it made a perfect day with him let me tell ya

I I guess I gave him my birthday cake in his class
which was about as long a birthday
party as Charlie can bear
and then we took him to uh a baseball game where he xxx
yes Charlie
you lost your mitt
where'd ya lose it
you didn't lose it you just left it in the living room
I don't know why

the big house but not xxx
I know it's your birthday and you got presents but you still have_to eat your dinner

I'm going to have some and it's going to be delicious
it has croutons in it
sprouts
hm

Charles normally I would say yes but um
I have a problem here
try a little salad and see how you like it
xxx later okay
how's that
whew
see those little thin guys there
those are sprouts
do you want to try them
you don't want to xxx
well if you don't want them you know what you do
you don't eat them
you push them aside and say no thank_you
Charlie I think you should try this
that is really good
Charlie's a born vegetarian
do you wanna go away and come back for dessert
is that what you want
you wanna stay
no ch
did you say you wanted him to stay and wait for dessert
no I just I didn't say anything
he said he wanted to leave and I said that crate a certain problem
sweetie I'll tell you something
you can't
wh what we have_to do is you have_to finish up your corn with me so you can have dessert
I don't mind your not eating any meat but you have_to finish your corn okay
well but then
do you know what we have for dessert
we're gonna give you leftover birthday cake and ice cream
if you finish your corn
ahhah
Charlie that's only that's only two mouthfuls
let me see how much there is okay
well lovey I can't help you
cause if you can't finish up you can't have more
you go and think it over xxx
honey
you don't have_to have it if you don't want to
that's up to you
you think about it okay
alright don't think about it
where is your mitt
did you leave it in the tv room
oh well
Charlie as far as I know you're been in only three rooms
so it's either in the living room
I think it probably is in the
the tv room or the kitchen
are you a tired person Charlie
shouldn't be
he had a big long nap
uhhuh
did you tell Dad what else we had Charlie
what did you stop and get with Sabina
ahhah
and did she have a huge enormous one
how big was hers
that big
that big
she had two scoops didn't she
that big
two scoops like
this this big don't you think
that big
and you had chocolate sprinkles on top
it was an amazing ice cream cone
yours didn't drip cause you were very good that's true
what is all that on your t+shirt
what is all that on your t+shirt
chocolate nondrip
oh well
what
two pieces
just one bite
two mouthfuls of terrible yucky corn
take a quick bite
will get you an entire plateful of heavenly chocolate cake
honey you can have your you can have ice cream but and cake
but you have_to figure you have_to eat at least a little bit more of your food before you do that
well then you just can't be hungry enough
I'm sorry
want some more meat
um a little bit more
ah I'll probably wait
hm
hey terrific
terrific
that was a surprise to have old Ralph call

okay
is that alright with you
did you need to talk to him about
I just didn't explain
did you ever write the letter
I didn't write the letter
and I want to explain to him why
I turned out when I got into it but uh Pat Davis had been given three or four specific indications from uh what's his face
oh to come down
to come down
xxx yeah
yeah
and uh
so I I talked it over with Nunan who called up a couple of days after Ralph and I discussed it o on something else
and said ya know I'd be more than happy to
use this connection
use this connection to set up the meeting but it would look a little silly seeing as he personally had been invited down twice
hunm
uh ya know
and uh why didn't he get on the ball and just sorta tell the guy he was coming down
and Pat said in fact he was going to Jacksonville anyway in two weeks and would call him
and I don't know whether he did or not
I feel as_if you oughta tell Ralphy that
yeah
uhhuh
hey Charlie

okay
is it so hard sweetie
how bout
I'll tell you what I'll make a switch with you

I'm gonna pick you up at noon

can you eat one more
cause that will guarantee you a place in hea a place in heaven and a piece of cake
there you go
see that corn right there
let's try and clean that up
can you do that by yourself
mhm
that's the way Japanese people eat rice Charlie
shove it in off the side of the plate
perfect
you betcha
you stay right here
in fact you get up in your seat
and I will work wonders for you
would you like it with some chocolate ice cream
you betcha

let's hold that
okay
hm
xxx not quite ready yet xxx
dodadododado xxx
yes Charlie
ba de do
that is the gravy spoon
all the juice from the meat runs into that little hole then you spoon it out
well it was running in
see all these little holes in the tracks down here
when you cut the meat the juice runs out_of the meat into that little track there
runs down till it gets to that hole
blew up
fills it right up
that's the way rivers and lakes work
look at that xxx
fantastic
wow
look what you got
wow
xxx a little ice cream and xxx
and chocolate cake
wowie
where are the candles
did you xxx your dessert I mean your soup
I ate it mm
good
you had the candles yesterday remember
and you blew them all out
in one breath
Charlie if yesterday was July was your birthday what day was it
but it was July what
July sixth
you remember
you betcha
school day
it was also a school day that's true
you're going to lick all that ice cream off that cake
and then it won't be as good
then he won't have_to eat the cake
mhm
when I took this in to school you should have heard the teacher lamenting as they would throw away plateful of of cake after plateful of cake
mhm
it was just
as far as I can tell kids are just not big cake and ice cream eaters
hm
an old myth
delicious
delicious and what else
scrumptious
and what else
cute
what else goes with delicious
delicious is part of like delish
and what goes with delish
huh
scrumptious
what about nutrish
delish nutrish
remember that
no
nope
not that one
I think that's a dodism anyway isn't it
hm
it might be
I'm not sure about that point
I had the usual conversation with Judy about whether or not they apparently I forget why
she and Mike stayed up til one thirty or two last night discussing whether or not they would have children
and what their prioritys was and what they wanted out_of their lives and what kind of people they was and xxx got_to me
that's pretty heavy
I said if you have_to really start really considering it it's impossible to make that kind of decision you know
you looked cheery and healthy this morning
you think that would make me look sick and ill
well probably
all the questions that you feel that you probably ought_to ask but most people don't on how why am I bringing these children into the world
uhhuh
and what kind of life do I hope for them
yeah
I said sh
I wish I had had my heart had not been so uh heavy with Juliet
I would've enjoyed the opportunity to discuss with her her attitude toward family planing and population control
do you think she has a strong
well it's funny that for for a person who makes a point of dedicating herself to the solution of human problems etcetera uh is to some degree
that's true
an idealist uh to say you should be unrestrained in your in the reproduction of your species because essentially it's fun which was what her defense was
having kids is
a source of satisfaction to the parents
not necessarily that it was uh good for the kids or anything else
that that they was a comfort in their old age and so forth
what she was saying to me was hm having kids having more than one more than two even is okay if you're if you're the rich and privileged class essentially
but that's terribly elitist
because how long does she expect uh people to be members of the class in which they presently find themselves
let's say ya know a generation down the road may be two or three
I mean
ya know you have your Adams familys and stuff like that
uh you look at
ya know there was a thing in Time magazine this week on descendants of the uh of the original founding fathers
and they're plumbers an and whatever ya know
mhm
mhm
uh and there's no guarantee that that wh when you're talking about a problem the consequences of which are not really gonna be f
well they will be felt immediately
but I think she xxx
but if you're talking about
a problem that is going to become critical in say one more generation or two more generations
mhm
by which time you have no reason to expect that your progeny are gonna have the same
values
well or the or the same resources that you're gonna have_to bring up their children as uh xxx
but what she assumes is that your progeny
nondependents
are much brighter than than the average American's brightness
okay that that in itself is false
even if they are brighter it doesn't mean that they're gonna be economically self sustaining
and even if they are economically self sustaining they're gonna take up space and they're gonna compete for resources with everybody else
they're gonna buy ya know
what was before the family uh the family acreage on Nantucket
was gonna split between the three
that's okay sweetie
male heirs or however they decide to split it
I I agree but y your speaking from the conservationist's point of view and it would be interesting to hear
well e even even from a human uh from an aesthetic point of view in which she want
I think there's some supposed to be what twice as many people in the by the year two thousand or something like that
does she want that
I don't know whether she
it seems to me she's taking very much in the attitude of
I find pleasure in it right now and it's somebody else's problem later
you think that's the way she's viewing it
I think she's caught in a funny position in that she's now very much of a a women's movement member
hm
but where she spent her life bringing up her children and doing nothing but bringing up her children
uhhuh
until they was high school age
mhm
you can't really say that was a total waste of time
mhm
first of all she doesn't believe it
yeah
secondly she doesn't wanna believe it
yeah
see what I'm aiming at is that arguments for population control don't say that uh that bringing up children is a waste by any means
mhm
huh
yeah
it acknowledges the fact that children are ya know a rare and xxx unique pleasure
and so xxx it's just like a_lot_of other rare and unique pleasures like driving a twelve cylinder car at eighty miles an hour
at times you just can't do it in a world of finite resources
it seems to me that ya uh
I can understand two but more than two no matter how talented and clever you may think you are
if you're talented and clever enough to feel those people who aren't will have too many children then you have_to more than make up for your share xxx too many
well that's another thing
it just gets a little funny because first it's distinctly
ya know people say that
hey hey hey hey
uhhuh
hey you
that's no good
if you don't wanna eat it that's okay too
but I don't want you playing with it
no good to play
ya know what's a good thing to eat with
um your spoon
spoon is very good for cake
spoon is much better for cake for you
what she expresses a_lot_of concern for and seems to have a genuine concern for is reflected in the programs in the Y and so forth
ya know the the disenfranchised the disadvantaged the poor the needy and so forth and so on
uh and then she turns around and says that uh
you as members of the upper middle class shouldn't restrain from having children because yours are gonna be yours are gonna be
but they should
because P_r's are
yeah
I mean that's the obvious implication
it is
it's true
which which strikes me as ya know elitist in the extreme
well it is
you're quite right
it makes her so obviously contented
that
uhhuh
may explain why she has so much trouble getting along with the people she
has_to deal with
I hate to say that I go both ways
not so much on the issue of of um
having more than two but when I talk to her I'm she or somebody like her and they say you should have more
what fun it is I find myself saying right that's great
first I have_to clean you off
would you wait here
hey
what's up
you don't want any
I think you have enough on your shirt to last you through a long cold winter
let's see your face
hey you know what would happen if I weren't holding on to this chair
and you were climbing up on it like that
you'd fall on your nose
hey
get down sweetie
that's not that's not safe
put your foot down the middle that's the boy
now
