oh is that a story that they read to you
seals go to school
who read you that story
is that a story that somebody read to you at school
and what did he do at school
he read a book
at school
my books
we saw seals at the zoo once
remember
the San Francisco Zoo
they're in San Francisco
okay
what did the seals do at the zoo when we went
remember
no they were going on the slide
weren't they
or those were penguins
those were the penguins
the seals were swimming in the water I think
I think it was penguins
not seals
I think the seals are probably too big to slide on slides
penguins are smaller
it's a trick that they learned
for the fun of it
remember
and then they went swimming around afterwards
and the man fed them some fish
you liked the zoo when I took you there
the ducks were
what did the ducks
where were the goats
yeah they were walking around weren't they
and what did you do with the goats
you had some food in your hand didn't you
he did
what did it feel like
kind of wet
was it kind of wet
the the lick of the billygoat was kind of wet I think
does what hurt
no it doesn't hurt
what is this story about
and where is he going
where's that boy going do you think
oh where do you think he's feeding the elephant
yeah the elephant fell down
what's the boy doing here
I don't know why he fell down
I think he tripped
he's just a baby
he tripped over
so he fell down
because that's what happened to him
well sometimes babies don't know how to walk very well
even Kirsten
does she walk
why doesn't she walk
what does Kirsten do
yeah well that's
this is a baby elephant
and he probably just learned how to walk
and that's why he fell down
what's happening in this picture
we'll have_to go to the San Francisco Zoo then and see all the animals
ummhm
what are they doing
what's this penguin doing
they are
what are they doing
I don't know
what do you think that seal is doing
he's trying to lick the boy
there he's talking to him
he's got a big mouth doesn't he
oh he's got an awfully wet tongue
why does he
um
because it's big
what did he do here
yeah that seal's kissing the boy
they're in the zoo
in the cage
he wants to play with the seal
what is he playing with the seal
no they're on the ground there
what are they doing
what are they doing here
um
they're playing ball there aren't they
what's happening there
it's a book all about the zoo
we got it for you one day when I saw it
I thought you would like it because I knew you liked the zoo so much
what's happening there
wow that must be difficult to do
oh only grownups can do that
people who are lion trainers can do that
actually that's a lion
that's pretty dangerous to pick up a lion
because they could bite you
because they could bite you
because he's a lion trainer
looks like a nice lion though doesn't he
he's eating something
can you tell what it is
no I think it's a bone
what's this little girl saying to him do you think
what do you think she's saying
what would you say if you met a lion
is that what you would say to the lion
no
you wouldn't go inside the cage
you would stay outside the cage
I don't know
that's a strange place for her to be
that must be a very tame lion
and the man must have said it was okay to go inside
she's playing with him
what kind of a game do you think she wants to play with him
no that's the ball
it's hanging down in front
what did she attach the ball to
I see
so you see what she's doing
she's dangling the string in front of him
why do you think
ummhm
no that's not you
that's another girl
does that look like you
I don't know what her name is
she's a bigger girl then you are
she looks like she's about five years old
she wants to play with the lion
is it time to go to bed now
okay you getting tired
what's this boy doing
shall we finish this story first
what's this boy doing
he's patting someone
I don't know what kind of an animal that is
I think it might be a walrus
what's he doing here
he's looking at a story all about the walrus
oh I think the little boy is going for a walk somewhere
do you go for walks
where do you like to go for walks
where
where else
