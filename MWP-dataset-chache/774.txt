in seven months
I think that fourteen days is more like it
you want a grapefruit
sure if you want one
yeah grapefruit is good for you
but you like it now
that's nice to know
right
he sure will be
I already am happy just thinking about it
yeah I'll come eat some
can't I have more than one
um thank_you
I'm sure they do
I'm sure that they would like them
gosh this is really juicy
because it must be just right
you chose a perfect pomegranate
Abe be careful
okay I just thought I'd warn you
Mommy and Daddy are
we're having a discussion
what
we're just playing
Daddy was trying to wrestle
that's just Daddy
he likes to wrestle with you too doesn't he
Daddy likes to wrestle with you too doesn't he
I wanna wrestle with you too
how come
what are you eating
okay just one
because I'm not hungry okay
there I got some more out
I'm getting them out for you so_that you can eat them easier
is that alright
what do you guess
you can eat them until you're full I guess
then you can have yogurt or grapefruit if you want
it's already untied
do you want me to tie it
tied
you think his name is tied
I think it's Todd
because when he was born he wasn't a girl
huh
how long ago was I born
I was born
before dinosaurs existed
he's an old man
shit I was born in nineteen fifty
it shocked the world
a dinosaur was recreated
there was holy day throughout the land
what happened when you were born
oh yes sir Daddy was so happy
I was really happy too Abe
because we were waiting for you to be born and you were born and we all said
hurrah
okay I'll put the rest in the fridge
I'm glad that you like pomegranates
wow I've never seen red hands like that
because pomegranate juice is red right
if you want it
uhhuh before you were born Mom and Daddy used to eat twenty pounds of grapefruit a week
oh you used to like mushrooms
oh
it is
I have_to
do you like mushrooms on pizza
yeah
yeah do you
yeah they're fine
uhhuh
I'm not
I'm just cutting it so the fruit will come out easier
and some of the juice is leaking out
well eat your grapefruit first
and I'll get you some yogurt when you're through
the grapefruit
here's how you do it
here is it sour Abe
you don't want the rest
would you like to watch Sesame_Street
okay I'll turn it on
okay I'll sit over here
that puzzle
Daddy did
no at a store
what do you want to paint with
what do you want to paint with
how about water colors
chili
well if we don't eat it all we have_to store it
so_that it won't spoil
what
I'm already done
what are you doing Abe
how come
just because
Abe
don't whisper
I can't hear you
oh I'd rather you talk
because you tell such good stories
you're going to put the other animals away and tell a hippo story all by itself
oh okay
you do huh
maybe we'll play a game later on
but not right now okay
okay when we play a game we'll play with the hippo
okay
you're too little to play that game
how come
Mommy said that you were too short to play the game
oh just for a hippo game
oh say what happened
did you knock those out_of the cup
a cowboy
I can get the watercolors for you
but I'm doing dishes right now and can't mix the temperas
the Tempera ones are ones I have_to mix up
you'll have_to wait until I'm done with the dishes
I don't know
okay that's alright with me
it was a coyote
I'm not
oh I wouldn't kill a cowboy
I like cowboys
I wouldn't kill his gun
a fish is eating the gun up
I'll tell you what that has got_to be one of the hungriest fish I've ever seen
the hippo's scared because he saw a cowboy
those are looks like some kind of Christmas cookie
you're going to make gingerbread cookies
that's a good idea
it wiggles
let me see
it has one two three holes huh
well it wiggles
because these are loose
Abe come here
right it wiggles
because these are loose now
how do you think we can fix it
right
we have_to tighten it up see
yeah now that it's tightened up we can play with the workbench
do I have a workbench
not of my very own
but we use the kitchen table like a workbench around here don't we
nope I'm afraid I don't know how to play bong_marble
how
you play with a big bong
and you bong that marble with your gun
what exactly is a bong
is it like hitting it
oh how come you don't say we hit it then
oh so you bong it with your gun
and what does that mean
do you want to show me how
here
oh you want to get the marble out right
I don't know if you can or not
let me see
no looks like it's been glued together
that's right
but we don't want to break it
since it's been glued
by who
oh it's been glued right there
uhhuh you can see the glue right here
who do you think glued it
who got us this
Darrell
oh he just felt rich one day and said
here you guys can have this marble
uhhuh if you break it you have_to glue it again right
what is
those sticks
oh those marbles
they're a little too small right
how about if we play with a balloon
we can pretend
okay am I supposed to hold it
and you bong it
okay I wanna see what a bong is
oh it looks like you push it
is that what a bong is
you hit it with your gun
and hitting it with your gun is called bonging it
if you hit it with your hand what would that be called
hit ball
tell Mommy what that is
oh what if I held it up here
would you be able to bong it better
where's it go Abe
Abe what if Mommy kicked it
what would it be called
bong_kick
are you alright Abe
oh how come
are you sure
Abe kids are sledding out on the hill
why don't we go
that's for a sore throat Abe not for owies
how come you don't want to go slide down the hill
that doesn't matter Abe
you need fresh air
uhhuh two hippos
what's happening
a hippo jumped in that pot
how come
a bunny_bing
boy I wish I knew what that was
oh a bunny_bing is a place where you go to get your teeth fixed
if I had a tooth pulled what would that be called
if I had a tooth pulled at the bunny_bing what would that be called
that's understandable
I don't think he knows what he's talking about either
Abe why don't we go get our coats on and go play in the snow
okay
you're going to paint a picture of Santa_Claus
and a witch
why don't we go out now
and you can paint when we come back in
okay
I hurt my thumb today
and that pin holds the bandaid together
no I won't
it's sticking in the bandage not in me
what's that
it's a broken snake that Santa_Claus killed
are you sure
is that a picture of me
I thought it was a picture of Santa_Claus
that's me with Santa_Claus
oh wow

that's a good idea
okay
okay that's what we'll do
do you want to paint another one
