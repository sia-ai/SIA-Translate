I think perhaps it'll be a good idea if you ate it
you can have peanut+butter and butter
but I'd like you to eat that while you're waiting
did you put one piece in or two
one
because if you put one in you have_to put it in this side not the other side honey
oh I don't know why
put it in
why do you say that Catherine
because there's a thermostat
and you burn up the toast if you just put it in the far side

www
fixing the toaster
