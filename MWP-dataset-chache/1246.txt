I'm just gonna check
okay well let me just check
sometimes when another person looks it's just it shows up
what's a sock doing there
alright
was Daddy folding laundry today
you say that as if it would be a strange thing for him to do
hm why are socks here
okay
I do not see any George books here
you are right
I'm gonna look in the
I'm gonna look in the living+room
let's look in the pile that's in the livingroom
here's George Goes to the Beach
mm

let's check in here again
this is the George costume party book
we can also ask Daddy when he gets home if he has seen it anywhere
hm
well you can still act it out even if you don't have the book
but let's think about this
is there some other place where it could be
I wonder
could it be in the toy basket that's in the livingroom the one that looks like this

a puzzle piece

did he swallow a puzzle piece
oh the man with the yellow hat had to go somewhere else while George was at the hospital
you know that would never ever happen in your house because we would never leave you at the hospital and go somewhere else
not until you're quite a big kid and even then we probably wouldn't
well it would depend on the situation
uh we would probably sleep in your room until you were quite a big kid
we probably wouldn't go anywhere

I will go home now
I have an idea
we could make an animal hospital and Pushpa could be the the veterinarian instead of the farmer
and she could take care of the farm animals that the farmer brings into the veterinary hospital
yes
Veena has to walk with the animals is there a vehicle that
whoop
oh okay
it's not a farmer
okay
oh hm let's see hm let's examine this young calf here
is it this boo this ear or this ear
both boo+boos on both ears let me see

hm okay I'm going to give you a prescription and I want you to put this ear cream on the calf
go get that at the pharmacy is there something wrong with your adult cow as well
oh you have a microphone injury
oh this big cow has a microphone injury hm
where is it exactly
on the tip of the cow's ear alright
let me just examine this with my special cow otoscope
hm yes there's a different prescription that cow needs a different kind of medicine
from the pharmacy here you go
okay
yeah
thank you for coming
I think you should call me tomorrow and let me know if the ears have gotten better after you put the ear cream on
okay
Veena put them on both
that's good
you know usually it's the farmer who brings the cows to the veterinary hospital
yeah because cows don't actually
well cows cows usually really need a human to to drive them places
I guess that's the main reason
oh they were walking yeah
oh it's close by that's why you told me
that's good
I think they're all in the chicken coop that you made
oh dear is there a chick emergency
oh what's the problem with this young
that's good yeah
well hello little chick what seems to be the trouble
oh you have a foot on the oh injury on the bottom of your foot there
let me examine this
this chick's foot here oh yes okay
let me bandage up that up a little xxx
and I suggest that you wrap this chick in a warm blanket
for at least a couple of hours
well you'll have_to find uh something smaller like a cloth napkin
and wrap the chicken in the cloth piece of cloth
just for a few hours to help while its while its foot is bandaged and it needs to rest
it needs to stay warm while it's injured
and then at one o'clock you can take the bandaid the blanket off
well you don't need to tape it on all I'm saying is you need to keep the chick chick warm and dry
and stop it from running around for the next few hours
well I I would suggest you try to keep it keep it nice and quiet and maybe read it a book or something
the chick doesn't like long stories I see well maybe you could read it some poetry
thank you for coming why don't you call me tomorrow and let me know if the chick's foot has gotten better or not
oh
Pushpa's over here checking the camera
oh good
I'm glad to hear that
those these cows need to go back home

it might be hard to get that out actually
do you want that to come out
do you want me to help you
I think we need something to take it out like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out
I might need a special tool to take out that wax
no something very narrow
like a pen even or
something very small
oh you took it out
oh no there's still a little bit in there
good it's not soft right now
there
now it's all out
should I take that
okay
great
uh so
the tree's gonna be the treadmill at the veterinary hospital
mm is that for checking how well the animals' hearts are working
oh
okay
Pushpa is the doctor or the nurse
Pushpa is the veterinarian okay
okay
that's a good question
I think so
that tree is a painted tree
that I think is a willow tree isn't it
it's a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water
and what
yeah
it could be growing near the pond at the farm
mm to hold the base of the tree
well there's two pieces of wood making up that tree
there's this part and there's this part and this is attached to this with the screws
I think it's supposed to be the grass under the tree
I think that's what that's supposed to be
yeah
okay
okay here's the doctor
oh he's the veterinarian
okay
let's see
who's going to bring the sick animal
who's the sick animal now
which
all of them
okay
well in the morning the doctors probably have_to do their rounds
that means they visit all the sick patients
oh so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital
curl up
her mother is a doctor
I'll be right back
I'm gonna look something up Naima
so only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording
when I played it back I heard a little interference that then went away so I'm hoping it's not major interference
okay
let's see what's happening with these animals
yeah
oh
okay that's the receipt
okay
yeah
okay we can play that when we get home from gym class sure
okay
do you want to keep playing uh veterinary hospital now
alright
alright oh is this a sick mouse
okay
where's the veterinarian
I think this this person is gonna bring the mouse into the veterinary hospital
this is my pet mouse and it has a hurt tail
can you examine my mouse and figure out what the problem is with the tail
and maybe bandage the tail
okay
there's not even xxx
you mean which door is for which stall
oh it's hard when they're open to figure it out isn't it
these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital
is this the xxx veterinary hospital
okay
okay does the mouse need some medicine
and who else is an animal who's gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital
this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert
oh
well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined
and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company
and here's the doctor
what does the doctor say
mm
okay
well should I come back to check on my cows in the morning
okay
goodbye
goodbye
there's a stall for you I think where you can be while you're getting better here at the veterinary hospital
a colt
it hit its nose on Pushpa
oh
does it need a nose bandage
oh dear
that's quite
is that something like a concert injury
I see
oh and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital too
and I know they will take good care of them so I will go back to the farm and do farm work while they are here being treated by the veterinarians
treated well by the veterinarians
okay I've got_to go back and feed my other animals here
the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat who lives here who isn't sick who just lives here all the time
the pig's eating something
mm
what's wrong with the cat
it licked too much milk
oh
huh
did it get a tummy+ache from that
I see
oh
okay
Pushpa what are you going to do
