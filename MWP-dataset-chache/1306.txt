you wanna read this
you wanna read that
that one's a good one too
which one
this one
oh this one's fun
giraffe
giraffes can't dance
alright
wanna read this one
let's read this one
this one's xxx
there's a giraffe dancing
yeah the monkey
hm
this is Gerald
Gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim
but his knees were awfully crooked and their legs
his legs were rather thin
he was very good at standing still and munching shoots off trees
but when he tried to run around he buckled at the knees
where every single animal turns up to skip and prance
see here's a jungle dance
and this year when the day arrived poor Gerald felt so sad
because when it came to dancing he was really very bad
the wart+hogs started waltzing and the rhinos rock and rolled
the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold
are they dancing
the chimps all did a chacha with a very latin feel
that's right
and eight baboons that
and eight baboons that teamed up
or a splendid Scottish xxx
Gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but the lions saw him coming and they soon began to roar
hey look at clumsy Gerald the animals all sneered
giraffes can't dance you silly fool
oh Gerald you're so weird
Gerald simply froze up
he was rooted to the spot
they're right he thought
I'm useless
oh I feel like such a xxx
yes you're right
so he crept off on the dance floor and he started walking home
he'd never felt so sad before and so sad and so alone
then he found a little clearing
and he looked up at the sky
the moon can be so beautiful
he whispered with a sigh
excuse me coughed a cricket who'd seen Gerald early on
but sometimes when you're different you just need a different song
listen to the swaying grass listen to the trees
to me the sweetest music is those branches in the trees
he's closing his eyes and he's listening
so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you
everything makes music if you really want it to
with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin
and Gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing
his hooves had started shuffling making circles on the ground
his neck was gently swaying
and his tail was swishing around
and then he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere
then he did a backwards somersault and leaped up in the air
Gerald felt so wonderful
his mouth was open wide
I'm dancing yes I'm dancing
I'm dancing Gerald cried
then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance arrived with Gerald xxx and watched him quite entranced
they shouted it's a miracle
yeah it's a miracle
we must be in a dream
Gerald's the best dancer that we've ever ever seen
how did you learn to dance like that
please Gerald tell us how
but Gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow
then he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above
we all can dance he said when we find the music that we love
okay let's read the ducks
mwah I love you
would you like to sit on the other side
oh you're going to eat your toast
okay
that delicious
mhm I know you like that
would you like me to read this book to you while you're eating your toast
oh you wanna sit on mama's lap too
okay
oh I think that sounds like a good idea
as you always
as somebody very near to me always says
that sounds like a good idea he says to his mommy
that sounds like a good idea mom
this is called make way for ducklings by Robert McCloskey
Mr and Mrs Mallard were looking for a place to live
but everytime Mr Mallard saw what looked like a nice place Mrs Mallard said it was no good
there was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water
and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes and turtles
so they flew on and on
when they got_to Boston they felt too tired to fly any farther
there was a nice pond in the public gardens
with a little island on it
the very place to spend the night quacked Mr Mallard
so they
so down they went
next morning they fished for their breakfast in the in the mud at the bottom of the pond
but they didn't find much
just as they were getting ready to start on their way a strange and enormous bird came by
it was pushing a boat full of people and there was a man sitting on its back
good morning quacked Mr Mallard being polite
the big bird was too proud to answer
the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water and so the Mallards followed them all around the pond and got another breakfast
better than the first
I like this place said Mrs Mallard
as they climbed out on the bank
and waddled along
why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond
there are no foxes and no turtles and the people feed us peanuts
what could be better
good said Mr Mallard delighted at last Mrs Mallard had found a place that suited her
but
look out squawked Mrs Mallard
you'll get run over
and when she caught her breath she added this is no place for babies
with all those horrid things rushing about we'll have_to look somewhere else
what's that
it's a bicycle
that's right
pedals
so they flew over Beacon Hill and around the State House
but there's no place there
they looked in Louisburg Square
but there was no water to swim in
then they flew over the Charles River
this is better quacked Mrs Mallard
xxx looks like quite like a nice quiet place
it's only a little away from the public garden
yes said Mrs Mallard remembering the peanuts
that looks just that looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings
so they chose a cozy spot on one of the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest
and only just in time for now they were beginning to xxx
all their old wing feathers start to drop out
and would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in
but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the park on the river xxx and there they met a policeman called Michael
Michael fed them peanuts
and after that the Mallards called upon Michael every day
yeah
after Mrs Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael anymore
because she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm
she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her lunch or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there
one day the ducklings hatched out
first came Jack then Pack then Lack then Mack and Nack and Wack and Pack and Quack
Mr and Mrs Mallard were bursting with pride
it's a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and they kept them very busy
yeah there's a mommy
one day
Mr Mallard decided he'd like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like
off he sat set
I'll meet you in a week in the public garden he quacked over his shoulder
take good care of the ducklings
don't you worry said Mrs Mallard I know all about bringing up children
and she did
she taught them how to swim
and dive
she taught them to walk in a lines to come when they were called and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them she said one morning come along children follow me
before you could wink an eyelash Jack Kack Clack Mack Nack Quack Pack Quack fell into a line
just as they had been taught
Mrs Mallard led the way to the water and they swam behind her to the opposite bank
you're going to do this
okay
alright
do you want mom to read it or do you wanna just do it
okay
