you start you do it backwards
what's that
an s
start over here Sarah and then pull your pencil to me and then down
to me
that's nope nope
just like this and then down
because that's the way you make a two
that's why
that's different from your usual one
that's the one I wear down the beach
it's just a cheap one for the water because I don't wanna wear my rings in the water
yeah
they'd fall off
I left my other rings down the beach with everything else

do you know what this is Sarah
