you know what we have_to do
the space+man from the rocket+ship hasta meet
the astronaut from the rocket+ship hasta meet the alien from his rocket+ship
right and they each have
they each have their own spaceships
you want me to get you one of the astronauts
oh right because there's no gravity in space
he's floating
we need a piece of string to tie him to his spaceship don't we
mm let's find a piece of string
mhm here we we have a piece of string right here
this might help
okay
it's very long yeah
you want me to help you
maybe you could loop it through the loop here
couple of times like this
and then
yeah put it through
that keeps it on the spaceship and then we hafta attach it
to the alien right
should we tie it around his arm
yeah
you wanna do something else
so now he's attached
oh that guy
right this is just the alien
there we go we'll attach it to his xxx maybe his neck
around his space helmet
that's right
he can make some repairs to his spaceship right
mm yeah
now he can hang out in space
yep he's floating away up in the air too but we know he can always come back
because he's tied on to his spaceship
mm
yep
but he will never fly all too far because he's attached
so he is floating up woo this is fun zero gravity is fun xxx
can he do high moon jumps
his moon mobile ooh we don't
we don't have a moon mobile do we
here
first he hasta come down closer to his space+ship
so he doesn't float away in the we
on the
we take off the
string
there aw don't float away
whoa he was almost floating away
get into your space+ship or moon mobile quickly
we don't really have a moon mobile do we
what can we use for a moon mobile
the spaceship could float away too I guess in zero gravity
uhoh it floated up and went bonk right into a planet
bonk xxx
it might need some repairs here
