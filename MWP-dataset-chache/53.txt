boppo right there
now why don't you stop taking it off
wouldn't that be a better idea
it just came off
well be because you're bumping it
that's why it came comes off
it's being bumped back and forth
sure if someone's bumping it
that's how these things happen
I know about little boys and the bumping you do
I've seen little boys bump around
when I was a little boy I used to do some bumping too
now a days I don't I try not to bump as much as I used to
I'll tell you what's wrong with this one
it's a little bit twisted from what you just did
it's just not supposed to move around as much as you've been moving it around Ross Alexander
it's just not supposed to be bumped and bruised
you're trying to release them
don't release those bat guys
I don't want to go bang bang
just don't do it
okay okay I'm going to get ride of the mud flaps forever then
do you want to get rid of the mud flaps forever
if you
I'm will to get rid of them forever then
why are you trying to bump them
why are you trying to get rid of them and bump them
yeah
at the mud flaps
the mud flaps don't get shot
the mud flaps never got shot off in the movie
they just don't
the mud flaps are part of the intrical part of the system
look at you
look at you
you just munching it
I saw you munch it
no you munched it
I saw what you did
I saw you munch it
I saw the munching
the horrible munching
actually it didn't even fall off
it just got twisted
it just got twisted wasn't isn't even broken
it got twisted
it twists a little bit
it's only designed to go up and down
it's not designed to go back and forth from side to side
okay now there's munched again
look at it
what is oh maybe it needs snapped up there
ah see what happened
it needed to be snapped up in that part
now try it again
now lay it down with its legs down and see if it folds
okay that's all it's supposed to do
just go like that
and the more you do it the more you munch it
and you got_to snap it back
now that works
don't munch anymore
let em go
ahem
Ross was talking about the bears up in Carolot
who else's work is never done
Daddy
who else
mums
no do you know the saying is
a man he works from day to day
no ah from sun to sun isn't it
from sun to sun right
man he works from sun to sun
sun up to sun down
no no that means when you wake up in the morning I go to work and then I come home when I'm finished okay
sun up sun down
but a woman's work is never done
is that true
do women work harder than men
I'm stealing some of your Mark
who works harder Mommy or Daddy
daddy works hard
how come
what makes you say that
what makes you say that I work hard
what is it that I do
all that stuff conferences what else
working
what else
right
right
the reason you believe that is because Daddy complains a lot
Marky loves Mommy best
you know we can't choose which one of you boys we love the best either
I can't choose which boy I love the best
I can't choose
sometimes I think I love Marky the best
then sometimes I think I love Rossy the best
it's true Ross there's times when I think I love Ross Marky the best
uhhum
and that's just because you're not thinking about Ross
that's because I'm not thinking about Ross
then as_soon_as I think about Ross then I think I love Rossy the best
then I think about Marky and I think I love Marky the best
and go back and forth
it's like you had two lovely little chocolates here and couldn't decide which one to eat
you ate them both
yeah go ahead
let Marky talk
you're recording
Marky's telling what he did in school and is just walking up and down on the bed just yacking
there he goes again
oh no here he goes again
