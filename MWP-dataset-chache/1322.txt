let me tell you a special rule of golf
when other people are hitting the ball
you be quiet
ya
what
maybe
yeah
yeah
that's the nice thing to do is to stay outa their way right
you wanna stay outa their way
an be quiet too
you always gotta be quiet
just like football games
what are the special rules of football games
yeah
what about football though
that in football you don't get the ball
you just gotta watch them
the guys down on the field they get the ball
you don't have_to be quiet
but what you have_to do
you have_to kinda stay in your seat
you can stand up maybe every once in a while
that's about it
do you think you can do that
tell me what you're doing there
did you hurt your hand after awhile

hm
if you hit a golf ball on the green which club would you use
you're right
how'd you know that
what if you weren't on the green
what if you were on the tee

ready
