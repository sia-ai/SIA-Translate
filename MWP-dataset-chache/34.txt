and he said
uhhuh what about Skeletor
who turned into a cloud
some cereal now and I asked him why
he said

so I put sugar on all the Cheerios
um I told Marky I said
Marky hurt his Marky hurt his hand or something he bumped it

if he wants to get in he doose small things
he does slow
does he doose them or does he does them
