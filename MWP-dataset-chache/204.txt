she thinks it's fun to do it with something else
like some kids do it with dolls but she doesn't play with dolls I don't know why not So I mean this is sort of like a doll to her
Mami
does she have anything that's sort of like a doll
she has lots_of dolls half a dozen dolls
but she doesn't try to put them to sleep
or feed them meat or
nothing Nothing she just you know she just smile at them but she just she doesn't play with dolls like I thought she would
what do you think about the dragon besides its function is so attractive to her
She could have fed the dog or the boy
I think it's the fact that I was making the dragon move
and it was
but she isn't interested in putting her own hand in there
no I had to be there to do it
that's the main thing
does she have any puppets
uh yeah
yeah
does she play with them
no but she enjoys it when I play with them with her
it's I think it's a function of me doing it
does she try to feed you have a dog
we have cats
yeah but she sees dogs They're around
does she feed the cats
yes
she feeds she feeds she loves to feed the cats
she wants to feed them everytime she sees them
you know it's a big event
does she feed them the way she's trying to feed the dragon or does she just dump food into the dish and walk away
um I'll put food in the dish and she'll carry the dish and set it down and watch the cats eat
so
so she's not doing what she's doing here
no
what sort of toys is she most interested in right now
she loves puzzles and I read a_lot_of books to her um
as much as you can read at that age
does she have any particularly favorite books
um I have one called
Good night Moon
that she likes
why do you think that's
because she's really intrigued with the moon
why don't you play over here
see all the fun toys
ya wanna sit in here again
okay
are there any other toys that she's really interested in
um let me think um she has a little record player where she puts the records on and there's no plugs or anything it's really nice by Fisher_Price one of those preschool things she makes the records play little tunes and she really likes that
and um I bought her a little cup and saucer set and she's into that pretending like she's drinking out_of that
that kind of thing She likes outdoor things
riding her little tricycle and In fact that's all she wants to do is go outside and play this year
the first thing in the morning
outside outside
but she will if shut in her room play with toys otherwise I have_to be involved
or she follows me around and helps me do chores around the house She likes to do things that I do
like um well she'll unload the dish+washer for me you know plate by plate glass by glass
so she's not so interested in toys as she is in doing things
like I don't know She seems She seems like she loses interest in toys very quickly
and I'll buy her something that I'll think she'll be interested she'll play with it a little while and that's it
I don't know
she likes real things
um like she uh she likes to get into my pots and pans and spoons and things that kind of thing
or something unique like clothes+pins she likes to help me hang the wash
by handing me the clothes+pins the doggie and the dragon had houses and homes
does she understand those concepts
yes she says house when she sees house
real houses
yeah she says house you know we'll be going along and she'll point and she'll go house
so she does know what a house is
on the doll and on the dragon you pointed out some body parts What sorts of body parts is she aware of
she knows all of them I think so because she even said eyes one time when she was playing with this thing
and she recognizes that what's in the dragon's mouth is a tongue
yeah I think so
where's the tongue Dale
hIdang
see she said tongue
she was into taking things in and out does she like that
yes
yes
she likes taking things in and out
I don't know what she was doing but I have a potted plant and she was taking out little cupfuls of dirt and going over and pouring it out and coming back and going you know this thing went on for a long time I finally taught what is she doing
all this dirt under the rug
but little things like that she does like
you asked her a couple of times what her name was
does she know what the names of things are
yes
she calls some people by name
she calls people by name but does she understand the term
your name or it's name
I think so because sometimes she'll answer with her name but it's just been in the past week or two But she calls a_lot_of people by their names xxx she knows their names
when she reads books she does that only with you not by herself
once in a great while she'll read a book by herself
but it's very short and mostly she'll bring it to me if I'm around or her father
will she turn the pages by herself
she'll try it depends if they're those thick pages um I don't think she can turn those thin ones yet
unless it's just grabbing and that kind of thing she really can't turn pages that well
when she got_to the part about
Mommys ring
she really didn't compare it to her own
do you think that's too abstract for her
um I think she was just kinda bored with it
She has that book
I got her that book
and when you get towards the end she sort a loses interest so I think it was
she didn't play with the blocks
yeah she's not into blocks very much any more
except to throw them
do you have any feeling why they're not very interesting to her any more
I don't know She has a_lot_of blocks at home but she doesn't stack them or anything
she likes to throw them if anything
so I don't know why not
she seems to treat the dog appropriately
how does she know what to do
um well maybe because the cats get fed maybe she's seen people walking dogs um like the paper+boy always has a dog run along with him when he delivers the paper She knows what dogs are
I guess it is from observing
I don't really know
never thought about that
she wasn't very much into the phone today
she never has been
when I come here
someone said that phone just doesn't look very much like a phone
she has toy phones but she doesn't play with those either
but she does talk on the real phone now and then like her father calls every day from work and she'll say hi and goodbye and uh she likes the phone it's a big deal when it rings and everything but I don't know she just doesn't play One time I heard her talking away on her play phone
I guess it depends on her mood
maybe if anybody's watching
that could be
she was all by herself just in her room talking up a storm
of gobbledygook talk you know not
if you can call it that
with these goobly words you never ask her to repeat a word so that it sounds clearer to you
You don't say things like
can you say this
are you unconcerned about how well pronounced her words are
well I want her to have a good pronunciation but I figure it comes naturally I don't want to I don't want to act like a teacher
I don't care if she doesn't perform perfectly at two years old but if by the time she's three and she still isn't then maybe I'll I would take a different viewpoint or maybe with a different child I don't know what's normal What's proper and what's not
I think it's neat that she's talking and saying things and
she's pretty vocal on her own I just figure I'd rather have her talk and enjoy talking and not worry about how it sounds
just anything she wants to say and worry about the pronunciation later if you need to
if a stranger says
can you say that
what does she do
you mean like adults that come and say that to her
I guess because I have heard people come up and say
what's your name
and so I'm teaching her to answer with her name and probably as more of those things happen I'll respond
she's very talkative to people She'll always say Hi and Bye_bye and it seems like she talks a lot for people
she's already talkative
so I guess maybe just to say her name but seems like she satisfies people at the present time
she's into counting these days and you're into counting
what's her ability to count
we're my husband as I are curious about that
um she kinda picked up her letters quite spontaneously and I haven't really pressed here to count
but she came home from her play group counting one day
and I thought it was primarily because_of repetition she picked up from her peers
but my husband and I are wondering if she doesn't have one to one correspondence
now today she didn't demonstrate that very well
but we saw her playing by herself one night after he'd come home from work
we were talking in the kitchen and she just naturally sort of took herself off to her play area
and she had some wooden spools and she had them in a semicircle she'd arranged in front of her and was playing quite happily and counting out loud
so my husband and I sort a observed her from the doorway and then he was quite amazed
and he also wondered the same thing
we hadn't discussed it together
and he went out and he asked her how many there were and she counted one to one up to six and there were six of them
he removed one and he asked her how many there were and she said I've forgotten whether she counted up to five or whether she just said
five
whereupon we decided that really there was something happening with her that was definitely a little advanced
so we've you know we've encouraged her to count but I hadn't given her any formal counting
you know other than being exposed to this book which is sequential
I mean I hadn't sat down and taught her one two three
and neither had he and neither had my daughter
and I've quizzed the baby+sitter and she hadn't either so either she's picking this up quite spontaneously whether she has real one to one is still questionable but
it's something you're interested in knowing the answer to obviously
or if if she's so fascinated she lies and counts by herself
with pleasure
I mean it gives her great pleasure to to count and if that is so then then definitely maybe we should encourage that
or give her an environment that will promote it
it's not uncommon for skills to be uneven at her age so_that one time she can do it and not another it may have_to do with when she initiates and when other people initiate
when things are done under the child's initiative they tend to be better done
I see
well today obviously I was trying to get her to to to um get into it and she was not interested in that
and she substituted that at one point I think
the counting for the colors
I don't remember that
I asked her how many no I asked her what color the crayons were and because I'd asked her earlier to count she decided
mother get off my back
does she have blocks at home
I've forgotten
yes she does
does she do anything with them
yes she does amazing things with um the flat wooden blocks which she got for Christmas
she plays with occasionally um but re her baby+sitter recommended that I buy her the bristle blocks
and they are incredibly wonderful
and she every night creates something with them
and they are very interesting blocks
they s they they go perpendicular or this way and you can construct buildings you can construct
she was more interested in destruction she was less interested in building things than in knocking them over
does she do that at home
she does not have a toy telephone and as a result she really enjoys real phone conversations
and she does talk to her daddy regularly
and occasionally her friends
my husband would not let me buy her one
because she had a doll on her one crib machine and he felt that was so expensive to go out and spend five or six dollars on one or even just to have another toy was a little doubling it up
and I acquiesced
this one was only a buck ninety nine
I know it was still I think it's the principle of the thing too and it there are so few ways that I can please my husband but I found no trouble and also I found it very interesting to see her go into a play+room and seek it out
and uh everybody has them so really she doesn't
at home does she ask for help
if we're working together I sometimes volunteer it for instance if we're doing a puzzle together or she might be playing with a puzzle and decide that she would like help and she will come to me and ask for help
she was more comfortable in the chair than on the floor
does she prefer to play in a specific area rather than run around does she have a play area at home
yes
she does have a play corner
and she doesn't run loose she's very categorical about her toys she likes to they're always picked up at night and put into little baskets or whatever so_that they're not all jumbled together
she doesn't have anything like that at home does she
no
she has a small table with a free standing chair
and that's where she plays she plays in that corner
oh no that's in the kitchen actually
she does some work there
she has a standing up cha table in the um play area with a doll+house that she found at a garage sale last week it's a Fisher_Price one of those expensive houses that we found for two dollars and fifty cents with crayon marks all over it and it had some furniture in it
and uh we cleaned it up and it's it's beau she has been playing with that for the last week
with her little little people
that's interesting because she was very confined in her play
she wanted to be there
you urged her to climb back into the chair by herself and she couldn't
does she do any climbing around things
oh yes she's she capable of climbing in and out_of well in fact her play+pen her crib she climbed out_of her crib when she was I've forgotten when it was it was a couple of months ago and it's a very high crib
and we had to dismantle it and put her in a youth bed
she has not been containable once she wants to get out_of something
or into it
she's she'll climb into her play+pen if it's set up for another visiting child she'll climb into it with no problem
and she's very capable of climbing
discussion of Gail's knowledge of
what animals say
she knows all the animal sounds
I found it rather boring to go you know ask her to emote actually I don't normally do it just for lack of something else to think about
you asked her at one point
what kind of animal is that
and of course the word animal is sort of abstract compared with the word dog do you think she understands that concept
yes because we've been to the zoological uh museum at Harvard we've seen the museum about four time this spring to look at the aninals and um she's also been to Stoneham zoo three or four times so she knows the difference between she knows the difference between the zoological museum and the zoo I mean she knows that they're in cages and glass cages and they don't move and she does know what an animal is
this time you asked about boy and girl
last time she was fairly silent about that this time you asked about the dragon and she said
yes I'm good and I'm a girl
so
does she indicate when you're out shopping for instance that she knows the difference between a little boy and a little girl
oh yes
and in pictures she can identify from dress which is the boy and which is the girl although she still not sure about her friends for instance
she goes to a play+group with uh primarily girls except one little boy baby and Andrew's always crying and he's always miserable you know so probably if you say
he's a little boy
to it connotes that he's always crying but her friends Jesse and Matthew who are very much boys and very much friends of hers I don't know she's not really clear about the sex sexual subject I think
but we've been talking about big boys and big girls little boys and little girls
you also said
what's your name
what's his name
does she understand the concept of a name for something
I don't think she has the concept
she has names for all her dolls but we've named them as they came along
all all her dolls and many of her animals I don't know really if she does understand what your name is in that sense as a label
but she does understand names of people she knows she knows who's who
likewise you asked her
how old are you
likewise that's a routine right
both of those things I'm sorry the name I've been trying to teach her how to say
my name is Gail
when she's asked and to ask another little friend of hers if she's meeting somebody in the park
what is your name
my name's Gail
and we've done this in the car as a kind of exercise as_well_as
how old are you
and I don't think she has gotten the
how old are you
bit into her head at all
this is in_case she gets lost
yes
Lexington
I think
she knows that we live in Lexington but I don't think she really remembers it out of context
she's still into the Pat the bunny book what shrts of books is she into reading these days
well she can recite if you ask her she knows all of Peter rabbit
she knows all of make way for ducklings she knows all of this all of that everything and she's reading a_lot_of her old her older sister's books vintage when she was four or five years old she loves stories with content I got these little golden books Hansel and Gretl loves it and she seems to be able to sit through to the very end just enjoying the words
with the doll with all the funny parts on it she indicated that she wanted to fool around with the parts but she wasn't really able to do most of those things herself
which ones of those skills do you feel she has the ability to do
um well the zipper she knows how to zipper herself
but you had to hold it down for her
well that zipper's well she doesn't get it started and then zip up but she can zip a zipper and has been able to do that on her harness on her sweater up and down and manipulate zippers for a long the I just find that the snap on that is still what I said last time which was you can't open it you can't close it
it's frustrating and the button is to her I think she's in she knows what a button+hole is
I don't think she's ever buttoned and um the shoelaces
we fool around with laces but I haven't taught her how to tie
she's she's interested in watching me tie her shoes
can she untie her shoes
oh yes
unties everyone's shoes
you pointed out his hair his hat his hands
she's been very interested in she turned last week to her favorite doll and she was sleeping with and giving a bottle and she suddenly turned around and said
she has hands
little fingers on them
and it looked so cute
I remembered it and today she mentioned that he had hands and said
does he have
what else she mentioned the digits there so
you said
put your hand in the dragon and make him come alive
do you think she understands that
yes because we have a rabbit at home that she a puppet that she enjoys having me control but then she also enjoys talking to him
she enjoys him both ways she likes him inanimate and she likes she likes to pretend he's real to a certain extent
www
I noticed that when I was going through some of the play imaginary
we've been doing that with her dolls to with her little doll house that she picked out
she really thinks it's her thing
it is
but my husband comes home and his voice goes way up
and she'll come and she's very serious about it and she brings the little mannequin to the door and that opens and then some some other animal or figure and his voice is way up there
but she really believes it but then every now and then you see her eyes looking at the real person who's doing the real sounding and something's going on there and today while I was doing the dragon she kind of got a_lot_of eye contact for a minute and it was very cute
it was funny she wanted to feed it cheese and toast and bananas
are those her favorite foods
she's been starved for three days ever since her attack of gastroenteritis
and yesterday was just a nightmare for her
she kept going to the refrigerator and saying
well how about some pickles
or
how about a donut
and it was just killing
it was so difficult
and today was the first time she's had bananas and wheat cereal without any milk in three or four days
and she's just so delighted that she had crackers and chicken noodle soup for lunch
and she's just she's loved again
so she's got she's got things that she wants to eat on her mind definitely yeah
she'd love to eat some cheese
she's not gonna have it for a few more days
she thought the meat was toast
she knows what meat is
but apparently toast probably appeals to her right now a lot she'd like to have a nice piece of bread
she really would like it
so she's probably
she did a_lot_of talking about animals this time
more she seemed to recognize animals she didn't last time but she had trouble with her favorite
how come she didn't remember the zebra
does she really know the zebra or
yes
she does
we've been also looking in pet stores at the fish
she really knows what it is
it didn't come easily to her
was it the picture perhaps
one of the things you ask her to do is name a_lot_of things
does she spontaneously do a_lot_of naming
I think she knows them
I I think she's uh I'm encouraging her to vo verbalize by herself instead of having me supply them so perhaps I'm encouraging her
I don't think she would ever say something I think if she sees an apple on her the tray of her highchair she'll say apple but I don't think she would say it if she saw one in a book
and I don't think she knows a shoe in a book as she does a shoe on her foot
she's not really into reading books
ah apparently not
she loves them and she loves to sit and look at them but I don't think
she seemed to know the Pat the bunny book
I don't I don't know where she we don't have it so don't know where she learned
and she seemed to know right away to turn to the page with daddy's scratchy face
and she knew she patted the bunny which surprised me but we don't have that book
it's possible just because everybody has it that she's seen it some place else
does she have blocks at home
she does
she has um a set of about fifty little blocks and while I was working one of my baby+sitters would build towers for her and as far as I knew she would knock over the towers and the baby+sitter would build towers she'd knock over and then a few weeks ago we were playing at someone else's house and she went to the blocks and started building incredible towers
herself
and that so that's something new that she xxx
the shoes seemed to be some sort of an attraction they're new right
they're not
she has gotten this thing about shoes in the last few weeks and she just takes everybody's shoes and puts them on her feet and walks around the house to the point where we were in a store the other day and she walked up to a strange woman and untied her shoes
and started taking them off
how do ya like that
and she knows about socks
has she said the word sock
um hm
these things all look so different I mean my shoes and socks look nothing like hers
she has been around no less than six or eight people a day for the last two weeks and she'd always get the right shoes back to the right person
www
there wasn't too much in there that looked familiar to me
from her experience
were there any that did
well I think the milk she was saying milk at lunch today
put these way in the box
well she knows keys but I don't know if she knows the word
and I think a_lot_of those things apple that she would eat an apple but other than
well she does call it she does say apple
but I think it's generally for apple+sauce
she knew egg
she I think she does because when I say egg she comes running
she loves eggs
and but I
didn't she say egg
it sounded like it
but lately she has repeated almost every word we say so you don't really know if she knew it before or she's just repeating the sounds
she's got a kissing routine
oh she kisses a lot
she kisses things more than people
she'll kiss dogs and and toys and things she's not big at kissing people
does it make things better
no watch Kay
she likes watches
who is this kid Scott
Scott is well her nephew who she has just been in love with for two weeks
and she says Scott about every other word out_of her mouth has been Scott
would she play on the telephone if he were on the other end
we haven't had our telephone with us while we've been away so she hasn't seen a telephone to play with for a long time
so I haven't played with a telephone with her for over two months so I don't know
she seemed to sort of know what to do with it
yeah but this as I said before this one is different from ours
anyhow so I think she was just
yours is
a dial
she knew some things about the cage the door you called it a cage she understands that
no
I don't think she would know what a cage is
has she seen one
maybe a cat's cage we have a cage for our cat
but I don't know if she's really seen it
you showed her how she could work the puppet put her hand in it
do you think that she understood
well she has a puppet that we've been surprised that she doesn't put her hand in it
she doesn't know how to work it but she likes to put her hand in it
and kind of wave it around
can she name body parts
don't think so
she knows a_lot_of them but I don't think she knows doesn't say them
I know she knows I know she knows nose and mouth and eyes and I think she knows leg and I think she knows foot
about the hair brush
yeah that's one of her best toys
does she brush her own hair or others
everyone's
her own and other people's
oh she brushes our cat much to his dismay
does she handle it well
very well I think
I am surprised that she brushes her own hair pretty well
www
do you think she knows that that abstract little thing is a house
no
does she use the term
I think that when some people play with blocks with her they say they're gonna build a house
so she would say the word house but I don't think she knew what it was
just meant I'm gonna do blocks
you asked her to smell the flowers in the Pat the bunny book do you have flowers in the backyard that she's smelled
she knows what flowers are
we have been going all summer to kind of a wild place in Maine where there were lots_of wild flowers
and my mother picked her one flower one day and since then she will not go out_of the door if she sees a flower until she gets a flower
and she never goes outside without handfuls of flowers
does she smell them
she smells them other people smell them
in fact she wanted to pick the flowers in the nice little arrangements on the way in here
you asked her what her name was
I ask her that about five times a day
and she doesn't have an answer
do you think she understands what a name is
I think she does
I think she's just playing with me she won't say it
does she umderstand other people's names
she knows my name's mommy and daddy's name is dada
does she give the pets
not really because
she decided it's time to go home
do you think it's possible to get her back here for one more session
yes but the reason that I called you now is because we're going away for a rather long vacation so about six weeks yeah that's why I had to do it this week and that's why I was so nervous when I couldn't find you
is she into books more now
mm pretty about fifty fifty books with everything else
all of her toys as compared to books she'll play with half the time
does she have any particular favorite book
no
no
she prefers I think just the structure of hard books rather than
you have cookies down here honey
look at all these
if you're sitting down will she tend to pick up one that she prefers more than the others
I don't think so I don't think
she likes to do the Judy and Paul book does she have that book at home
she doesn't
and I don't know and she did that last time too and to my knowledge she had never seen the book before
does she understand the concept of smelling flowers
um hm
she likes to smell flowers
and does she try things like putting her finger through little holes
yes
in her head
but she's never had practice with putting her finger through mommy's ring
yes
she plays with our rings and watches and jewelry a lot so
I can't remember if she's the child who always kisses everything is that a game that you play with her
she hugs things a lot and I don't know where she got that either she when she first started getting interested in dolls and animals and she the first thing she does is hugs
them and oh
I guess we must have done it
we do so many things unconsciously that we don't find out until they start doing what you do
she knew the names of a bunch of animals today
she has a monkey that's a puppet
that's why she was calling that a monkey
because that's the only that's right that's the only puppet she knows
so she thought that was a all puppets are monkey's I guess
but she could say duck and doggie
yeah we have a book with those in so she knows I guess old MacDonald
what's her repertoire right now
that's about the the limit
um she knows birdies
she's very good at imitating and you often say
can you say this
do you do that at home a lot
um hm
and she says it
usually if she's in the right mood she'll repeat whatever whatever I say
are there any times when you especially like to do that with her
not really
just whenever I have time
do you do it to get a word out the first time or do you also do it when she comes out with something and you don't like the way it sounds
um I found that when I want her to learn a word I say
can you say something
but after she's started saying calling something by a word I tend to repeat it the right way if she says Gramps she says and I say oh Gramps
then she'll say again
she was into the dog you have a dog
no we have a cat
does she understand the concept of
house
her own is very big
does she have any doll house or
no but she knows about other people's houses
she knows where her friends live we walk down the street she knows precisely who lives in which house and what she can find when she gets in there
and she knows her own house she knows her grandmother's house and uh so I but I don't know about little houses I don't think she
she didn't say brush but you seemed to feel that she knew it
she plays a lot with my hair brush
she has a new little toy that she plays with all my hair things my bobby pins and barrettes and hair+brush and yesterday I said either
go get the hair+brush
because she'd carried it away from me or
what is this
and she said something that sounded like hair+brush
so I know she knows the word and I think she said it yesterday
can she do her own hair
she can she does
she brushes her own hair in one direction or another not
not into the blocks
she likes her blocks
but they're a little smaller and more more interesting I think
there's lots_of them in there
easier to build higher things with
what does she tend to do with them
put one on top of the other on top of the other on top of the other and then go boom
does she tend to like to take things in and out
yes she has uh she I don't know why but I allowed her to use the kitchen cabinet doors and drawers
and she has one book that is like this book
I think it's made by the same people
and it has doors that you open
and it has animals
and then they go to bed
and you open the door and see them sleeping
and she loves that with each little door
she takes things in and out
yes and she has been for a long time
that's one of the ways that we keep her busy
little things in things
you asked her to show you the eyes and she didn't do that does she know her own eyes
she does
yes
to Kay Kay
do you know where your eyes are
she knows her eyes and her ears
she'll point towards we worry about her eyes says
eyes
and she knows ears and mouth and nose and toes nose is her favorite
nose
www
no
I don't think she knows either
she said man yesterday but that's the first sex difference
do you think that's because she doesn't find them useful
I think yeah I don't think there is much difference for her right now
she was real big on the breakfast foods
and her favorite thing is raisin Bran and she just as you can see breakfast food is her
can she drink on her own
yeah
does she have favorite things
no she just likes to drink
she'll just drink water and just drink it
she likes glasses and cups
juice is anything liquid
will she call milk juice then
she calls everything juice water grape juice and milk are all juice
anything liquid is juice
www
no she has her own but it's a regular bowl
how old is Lena at this point
she's gonna be two October fifth so twenty two months
she knew a bunch of words in the basic vocabulary book
she knew about things like spoons and a cup does she name things around the breakfast table
no
but
they're named
they're named for her
what are the sorts of things you name for her
well it's not conscious
it's saying
Maura get the bowls for the cereal
we need the spoon
where's your napkin
does anybody need more juice
around the table you wouldn't say for instance
what's that
that's a spoon
no
she does know what a brush is does she use one at home
last night she did the most extraordinary thing
she um found a comb and she was combing my hair and then she started to comb her hair and she took this hand and she gathered her hair behind her and started to comb it into a pony tail
which I thought was extraordinary
she uses a brush usually
because she named the brush but not the comb
didn't name
no I was surprised
no she knows comb
I would say she knows comb better than brush
because that's what she used on the kid's hair
you kept probing for that and
she wouldn't say it
no
you are dressed
I'll fix it
she has a whole bunch of interesting phone routines
you say
say hello hello
Say
how are you
you do that with her
yeah
she repeated one of them
how are you I am fine
yeah it sounded like that
yeah that's what she was I think
so when she gets on a phone she actually talks to people
no when she gets on a real live phone she doesn't say a word but when she's playing with a play phone she talks Occasionally she'll say
that's Grammy
but
she doesn't just name something she'll say
that's something
yes talks and uses words grammatically
yes she does
give it to me Here this is yours
I mean it's all very grammatical
a couple of times you asked her if she needed help with things
does she ask you when she needs help
or do you have_to intuit that she needs help
no she'll ask
what will she say
she'll say
Help me
she actually says that
I didn't hear her do that
well under the circumstances I was right here
but if she was trying to do something she would come and get me and say
help me
open the door
I wanna go outside
the dolly is stuck
whatever and she'll tell me as much as she can
I was going to ask if she can take her clothes on and off and I guess I don't have_to
no she can
are there things with her clothing that are easier for her to take on and off
most of her dresses have buttons in back
so she can't get those off
um her nightgowns that have buttons in front I have_to to pin closed
because she'll take them off
in the middle of the night
um her underpants she can't get off
can she put clothes on a doll
they she does but she does it it's not that she's putting a dress on she'll take the dress and drape it over the doll
or she'll go and she'll get clothes she'll put on my shoes and becomes Mommy and gets a bag and goes shopping
you asked her at one point what the doll's name was
does she name dolls
no Well Maura does I've never watched I don't know whether Lena necessarily knows the names of the particular dolls But she names people
because Mommy's name is Cassy
and if she's Mommy she calls me Cassy
isn't that interesting
when she named the keys she didn't say keys she said
car keys
well those are Mommy's keys and that's Where she sees them being used in the car because we rarely lock the house
you were trying to narrow down her definitions of some words she wanted to call the sneakers shoes
normally she calls sneakers sneakers sandals sandals slippers slippers
They're very different things
do you deliberately try to narrow things down like that
I I may
I don't realize it if I'm doing it
I mean I think what I probably do is say Let's put on your shoes And after a little while when shoes is a familiar things I mean she knows what they're for I say
let's put on your sneakers
let's put on your sandals
let's put on your boots
just and I don't know what I do
you pointed out that one picture was the Cow jumps over the Moon
do you do nursery rhymes with her
not as much as I should
Well I'm just aware of what I did for Maura
and less for Jeff and virtually nonexistent for this
does she know rhymes like that
I think so
she likes that one
she always laughs when she hears about the
dish ran away with the spoon
she thinks that she thinks that's funny
does she know what the moon is
I doubt I doubt it
I don't know
www
yes because the last time we went to my mother's house we did not go to the lake house and she said
Where's Grammy's lake
lake is a very advanced term for such a young child
she said as we approached as we pulled into the driveway
this is Grammy's house
where's Grammy's lake
because she had only seen the lake once
www
she won't let go of me
oh she went swimming at Lindsey's house
yes she is extraordinarily good in the bath+tub and the little pool
but once she's got the life+preserver on in deep water she clings
you said that the bath+tub is to get the baby clean
does she understand that
yes
she washes her face clean
after she has she eats if she spills anything on her dress her dress has_to come off and she has_to put on a clean dress
she takes the washcloth and washes her hands and then she you know I say
she really used the phone a lot this time compared to other times
does she use her toy telephone at home
we just got a new one
the old one was broken
and has she been using it
I wouldn't say so but I may be wrong
does she use the real telephone
no
how does she know what to do
oh that's just the telephone routine
she may not do it on the real telephone but she may do it on her own telephone
I mean if she's playing I'll say
call daddy and ask him what he wants for lunch
yes that I will do
when I see it but it doesn't happen every day
will she talk if grandma calls
sometimes she will
sometimes she'll just listen
www
probably she doesn't expect it to happen so and because I don't let her talk on the phone that often it's not anything she's really accustomed to
www
no but she sees Maura's hair in the morning and she sees me do my own oh
yes she's been taking my brush
and brushing her hair
brushing my hair
does she brush her dolly's hair
um I have never seen her do it but she's taken very good care of her dolls
put this away in the box
she wanted to feed the dog
where has she learned to do that
nobody that we know has pets but she may have seen sometimes Maura she came up the other day with two kittens
the doggie needs his hair combed
yeah go find his house
she was into the books are there certain books that are more interesting to her
I don't think so
but she does pull the books out_of the bookcase and reads them to herself
no she looks at the she likes reading the telephone book
she picked up a bible one day and said
Jesus
very interesting
but with her own little books picture books
you asked what color the apple was and she answered
apple
sometimes she comes out with the right answer
I don't know whether it's a lucky guess or whether she really understands but if I say
what color's this
she'll say blue green red or yellow and a_lot_of times it's right
you were trying to get her to match colors
you told her the orange was the same color as her shirt and the house do you think she can really see that those were the same color
probably not
she wasn't concentrating on it so I would say not
she wasn't paying I didn't think she was paying attention to what I was saying
I think she was thinking
I don't think I would ask her what color this orange is I'd start out with the primary colors
Lena is that blue
yes
what color's mommy's dress
byu
see I'm not sure she really knows but she knows colors and when I say what color is it she will answer with a color
she was very careful to delineate boy and girl
do you have any idea what criteria she uses
I know
she said
that's a girl
and I would have said it's a boy
but I noticed that the hair was curly maybe that's
does she do that with real kids
she does it a lot faster sometimes than I do
she seems to be right I mean I'll look
is that a boy or a girl
and she'll say
that's a boy
and I'll look closely and say
right it is a boy
I would like to know what she I I'm looking at too many things and she may be looking just at the way a boy walks and a girl walks
I can't think
we're going into winter and she has a jacket with a zipper
this sweater has a zipper in the back
so she's never I can't think of anything that she's owned recently that has had a zipper
so I couldn't tell you or not up or down is easy
she had a pretty good grasp on it but didn't know how to exert the pressure to get it up or down
when you showed her the snap and asked her what it was she said
it's broken
she was very good with food names
and the ice cream I put in the mugs they've had their milk in
talks about
this is for me
exchange
no
she really knows
she really uses it correctly
she says
this is his this is Jeff's this is mine this is Lena's
she knows
are there some things she's beginning to get territorial about
her dollies
the other things are things nobody else would want anyway
her slippers her nightgown her clothes her room
she's very good about sharing
much better as I noticed at her birthday party than other kids her age
the concept seems to be deep and she's willing
www
the thing that occurred to me is the whale had blue around it it looked to me to be waves but
I looked again and I thought
maybe you could think it was clouds
you had to name the mouse and turtle
does she know them or were they bad pictures
no she knew turtle she didn't know the mouse and I think it's because it didn't look very much
like a mouse
I have a note here that's sort of cryptic
you asked her if she could build a tower and she said
meow
oh yeah
I said did you want to match it match it or something
I give up
noise is unbearable
she seems to know two in fact she's three because I can remember her saying that
Maura has a doll house
but she's talked a lot about a big house
the big house
there's my house when we drive past it
that's my house
and she's been playing with the bigger Lego blocks
lately she's been drawing on things
everything
including jackets coats walls floors couches and for the past couple of days that's kinda been her thing and she likes to read books a lot she spends a_lot_of time bringing books to us like um they're all over the house so she I noticed this morning if she just sort a walks and sees one she'll pick one up and bring it to somebody and wants to read books and then probably um the third thing she does a_lot_of is playing with a ball
she seems to have a routine with you when she plays with the ball
she'll do predictable things
yeah well I let her play by herself um like today she gets into sort of
but sometimes it's more of an interaction like when she really does throw it back and forth
and she catches it
yeah
she does
yeah
with a bigger ball it's easier for her to play um you know for her to catch it like that
she seems to know a_lot_of the items in the room here she was busy labelling things
does she walk around labelling things at home
um let's see
mommy wants to put diapers on you
I think she does label things
I think um yeah that she is learning a_lot_of new words and she'll say in fact I noticed that if I say a new word that she's never said before that she will repeat it after me
about the puppet first of all you've apparently taken her to
a zoo she just went to the zoo yesterday
so it's fresh in her mind
right
and she liked some of those animals
she said um tiger owl goose
no she really did see a goose
gu
gu
goose
and she's been
au
au
au
and she has seen all these the neat thing about it is she saw them all in the books before she went and so we read stories about zoos and she went and saw them and then when we came home we read the books again
yeah so_that it sort of made it more realistic for her
bu
bu
bau
first you told her the dragon was in a cage and then you told her it was in a
box
no
I noticed that myself
um I think I thought at the time that I called it a box which it is a box that I'm not really sure that um although I was thinking whether or not she's aware that the animals were in a cage or that this would be like the cages she saw and she did see cages um and cages are a more sophisticated term for exactly what that is
so it's probably some ambivalence on my part about her understanding
she was very much into the box itself
does she do a_lot_of playing around with
uh boxes
I think all kids when they see a box
are you the mother who indicated that she's an incessant opener and closer of cabinets
oh no
I think all kids do when they see
oh you want that to be opened
you know box when they get gifts they enjoy the wrappings and boxes more than the actual toys
with the dragon you were pointing out face parts
she definitely did know how to name them
do you practice things like that
yeah yeah we do
yeah
we did when she was a lot younger um when I first realized that that she could understand and begin naming things
the sort of use of the face to learn
um parts of the body
she's pretty good now
yeah she's pretty good
she's got eyes and
well she knows um chin and ears and um tummy
things like that
and she doesn't say arms or legs yet
she was pretty fascinated with the dragon's tongue
puppy
got a puppy
she wasn't too fond of the telephone although she played with it somewhat
just yeah she does have a routine
that's funny like you don't I think I'm not really aware of routines that she has but she definitely does
she goes to the phone and she'll
she'll lift up the the receiver and she'll say
byebye
byebye or hi hi
and she talked to her meme and pepe her grandparents on the phone this morning just this morning
and she is going to see them tonight
so I sort of prepare her for that
we're gonna go for the weekend
she was not fond of the books
this oh the books
um I think she just didn't want to read books right now
she's more because books is kind of like a sitting down relaxing activity and she's never been here before and I think she just had to run around that kind of energy you know
and she wasn't into the blocks
the blocks
no
but she does play with blocks at home
quite a bit
she sort of got into the doll belatedly she liked the things that she could fool around with on it
does she play with her own clothing
yeah not mutilate it no
I meant manipulate
some of the other children do that
yeah
um yes she does but I think more mine
she's good with the zipper
yes she is
she's never done a zipper before
first time
this is the first time she's ever done a zipper
ever
that I've ever seen her
yeah she was good for the zipper
um but because she nurses I unbutton my blouse usually and um she'll say
button button
and play with the my clothes
more than I've seen her play with her own although she probably plays with her own
it was cute because the doll's wearing the same kind of clothes as she is
yeah that's right
you were trying to call her attention to the fact that the clothing was just the same
do you think she
no I don't think she um paid attention to that
does she play with her own shoes
yeah she does
I thought like I thought it was interesting that you know she won't sit still to allow me to put on her shoes but that if it's sort of nice to have a doll where the child can do it to the doll and maybe they can understand that that's what you're doing to but um she wasn't ready to do that
maybe she's not ready for that concept
where're ya going Baba
wa
walk
a walk a walk
she wasn't into sitting around is she more of a runner
Marie we have_to put your diapers on before we go home
look
what's under there
what's that
huh
that's you
are there times when she's more talkative than others
yeah next time maybe we can come maybe I'll come in the afternoon because after you'd left and we had arranged for this time I realized that sometimes of course it's different
some mothers say that when I'm dressing her she's talkative
when she's getting dressed no
no
not getting dressed Because I don't talk to her that much when she gets dressed
and she's not that talkative um when she eats those kind of functions um but usually when her father comes home late at night um like after supper or something
she gets um crazy
and she just sort of for about an hour she talks a lot about a_lot_of things
she wanted to leave at one point and was distressed to find that the door was beyond her is she a big door opener and closer
yeah she is
yeah she's um I guess into doors
now
she learned how to open the door to our apartment and go out so I have_to keep it locked
but she always wants to go out
she has many more words
many more than before
was it six weeks ago that we were here
so like she's re second
she's come a long way in terms of building vocabulary
she knew some words that she was using like her pants and her shoes sneakers
generally what would you say she knows in that domain
clothing
um diapers um
she knows you know everything that she suits bathing suits I bought her a new ba bathing suit and then a couple of suits and I just said suit once or twice and she saw it when I washed it and she said
suit suit
ya wanna bottle okay
ba to
and then let's see hat she knows um it hasn't been warm so she hasn't been wearing sweaters or things like that
