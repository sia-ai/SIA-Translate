hello
yeah
hi how are you
yeah
yeah
he'll be six yeah in September
yeah well we don't know xxx
he's been at the French American school
for three years
and his French is amazing
um but the thing with him is um
something about the environment just wasn't working out for him he was getting really stressed about going to school
the last year and um
I sorta was kicking myself for not keeping him back and I had wanted to keep him back but
the teachers said oh he you know he's gonna be fine and we just had a bad year last year
and so I um
I was thinking about possibly putting him in a public school near my house and
then I just recently sorta had a big panic about it and I went and visited it and I just thought you know I just
it's just not
be
gonna be challenging enough for him
I know and the more
I can't even believe that I hadn't considered it when we moved here because
he is the perfect Montessori kid
and I hadn't even considered it
and so I was frantic xxx looking around ya know trying to
find out about possible openings
yeah I know
right
uh huh
oh
oh that might be so wonderful
xxx but xxx
right
right
right
right
right
right
yeah yeah
right
uh huh right because of
right yeah
he's been in a program
right exactly
exactly yeah
right
right oh no he's certainly not just xxx
this child is is a self um directed kid and I I honestly
it just dawned on me about six months ago
you know
that that's the way we need to go with him because he he chooses something and he goes with it
you know whether it's he getting in to
he's getting into these like um
making all sort of um I dunno pulley system things xxx
I mean he's ya know he's he really gets specific about stuff
like he's into levers and pulleys and then he's really into the ocean
and this
these cope Copipods you know I mean he's like crazy for it and
right uh huh
um I actually have a friend um Amy Amy xxx right who has a daughter xxx
who um is a good friend of mine and she's actually one of the reasons we moved down to Providence we both lived in Boston
before
yeah and she said oh you gotta
that's awesome
yeah really
well we had we had talked about um
when we had moved down here ya know school options and stuff and she's the one who showed me the French American school because she speaks French and I was like oh ya know and it was great in the beginning and then she ended up going the Montessori route and um
I've just been you know like I said I've been reconsidering what I'm doing but I would
obviously I what I want to do is have have him come in and and and have the
I dunno are you the director
yeah and and
right
oh wow okay
yeah right
and just have you meet with him and see
you know I the level the level
I was planning to put him in kindergarten again this year
because he's a September eighth birthday
yeah
totally
well that's what I thought but the reason
the thing was that when we had gone to the um
when I had gone to the public school I was like
I couldn't I mean the French school was almost way so advanced
that he'd be going back to
I mean these kids were doing stuff that he had done
um basically
yeah he's
he's reading um
it's called the trials of life
small words he's
I don't wanna push him on the reading because he loves to be read to
those are xxx
and we're we're reading a ton of chapter books and advanced stuff but when I try ta
get him to do ya know his hop on pop and all that he doesn't really wanna do it
so yeah right I right
exactly
yeah he's identifying everything I mean in signs oh this sign says that that says that and
and in French he's
amazing as far as he knows all
a lot of French words that he can just by sight you know identify
but um
he's he's not necessarily picking up books and reading them ya know
but I I would say that he's very close I just don't wanna push him in that area because he doesn't seem interested
with me
Violet can I give you a kiss good bye
uh he's been going full day
the last last
this past year
the year before he was uh five days half days
love you
and this year was
actually they didn't give us a choice I wanted to do half but
