okay
don't put that in your mouth Abe
where's the horn
well what's that
that's we have a big one for the pottie
that was to wash your dirty diapers when you were a little when you were first born
it sort_of looks like a horn
does it sound like a horn
may I see
listen
it sounds like a horn
looks like a trumpet when you do it that way doesn't it
you can't
are you a frog
oh what an actor
it doesn't have_to be chilled that much
hey Abe you want ta help me get some wine
no I'll get it
I'll get it
you wanna help me
that's a beautiful bottle
did you want wine also Abe
did you want wine
okay
you want what
you want the white glass
this one's for you Abe
that's the cork Abe
that's the cork
that's probably about enough okay
you want me to put some water in it to dilute it
that's a good idea
what are you doing
here you go
huh
wait Dad hasn't finished yet
okay just a second let me get pour one more glass
that's pretty good Abe
you have the corker
you think it tastes bad
do you like the way it tastes
oh it really tastes pretty good
uhhuh
it tastes like strawberries
doesn't it taste like grapes
is your finger a spoon
is your finger a spoon
did your finger get wet
think the table's your drum
huh
you want to start eat rolling out the tacos
oh that's a good idea
not right now Abe
not right now Abe look around at the glasses
they all look full to me
do you want to light this candle Abe
can we light this candle
well can I
may I light the candle
what color
matches you mean
good job Abe
yeah
uhhuh
it really is black
the fire burns the cardboard
wanna light it again
aw does it still have fire
alright
did you get your overalls wet
well I think that they'll survive
what do you think
think they'll dry soon
well Abe I guess you don't get any more wine
can't hold your liquor
no I'll get some
you can have milk or water instead
it does
is that the way you blow a horn
the bowl's in the sink
I've already washed it
I think you can have a taste though
how many do you think you can eat
four
four
how many do you eat Abe
no you just eat two Abe
you want four
hunm
how come
he likes you
he's one of your best friends
hope you all don't mind a square taco
sometimes I can't get them round
you about ready to eat Abe
that's a really sharp knife Abe
huh
this taco
uhhuh
don't eat it though
why we have_to cook it first
they taste better cooked
no you just eat two Abe
you did
did you want to lay down and take a nap
well you know you can anytime
you want to
you don't have_to stay up
sometimes if you get tired it's good just to sit down awhile
were you tired when I saw you
what's what
the calendar
oh to hold up the plants
they're called Lolley bolts
tacks
the colored ones
thumbtacks Abe
thumbtacks
huh
because you push them in with your thumb
I'm going to let you eat them
you got it
oh you're trying to hide one from me
I don't know why were you
will you have a Halloween party at school Abe
they sent something home today
but I haven't read it yet
hey that's a good one
just a second you're getting pretty good
I think I'm going to have_to start sitting down pretty soon
Abe you know what
I think we're going to all eat together
hey Ann do I need to grate cheese
what
okay how'd you like to wait and eat with everybody
and that way you can talk to us while you eat
because they aren't long enough to hit with a hammer
what Abe
I will cut the lettuce
now all of the lettuce
no
no half of it
half of it
yeah probably
you people like lettuce
okay I'll cut half of it
need to find a place to cut it
right here's the place
huh
oh this is wetter
moister
this is moister than the other one
it's really weird how things turn out so different when you make them the same
we're going to Abe
did you get a bite
you sneaking them away Abe
uhhuh
lettuce doesn't have_to be very small does it
don't fill up on the dough now Abe
I'd rather you eat them when they're ready
you're ready
and I'm ready
Edna's ready
Stan's ready
and John's ready
but guess what the tacos aren't ready
that's a rip
that's too bad
yeah
I'm ready
go ahead and have a piece of lettuce
I don't think that'll hurt you too much
Abe
oh are you eating lettuce
I thought you were snitching more dough
just cut more
wow
what a huge taco
it stretched
we finally get to use this thing man
one of Ann's boyfriends got this for her when we got married
he was like eleven years old at the time
isn't that the cat who got it
you want what
here try and sustain yourself for a second here
wow these are really strange tacos
I don't know
watch
look how they stretch
oh couldn't handle too much more lettuce
because that's about it
what am I keeping covered up with this
cheese probably
oh cheese
why am I keeping it covered up
because cheese gets really hard when you don't cover it up
onions can go there too
oh onions can
this one is over there
we're going to eat in how many seconds Ann
in how many seconds
yeah because I could probably just leave this out right
yeah
good here I'll uncover this too
it's really aesthetically unpleasant
leave it on top of the lettuce
so it doesn't get wilted
oh the lettuce won't get wilted
hey Abe if I leave this out you can't keep doing the taking all of the cheese man okay
I want you to eat dinner with us okay
if you keep snacking before dinner you won't be hungry
you ready
is it hard
you ready
it sure is
wait what are you doing
oh okay
well look you eat you eat just a tiny bit of that cheese okay right there
well go ahead
you can have more as_soon_as we're done
why don't you count to thirty and I'll bet we'll eat
yeah by the time you count to thirty Abe we'll probably all die of starvation too
count to thirty
count to thirty
can you count to thirty
don't count to thirty
okay sing just put he sang a long song
okay ready to sing
what are we going to oh man we don't want to sing that
because he doesn't know the words
you just like it
here man close your eyes
and you know what
I've got a surprise for you for after dinner
did you know that
I do too
for what for Abe
uhhuh
really two surprises for Abe after dinner
so why don't you wait and eat dinner with us okay
you can have a little bit more cheese
you are
I'm ready
and you're ready
Edna's ready
John's ready
and Stan's ready
guess what Abe
tacos aren't ready
I am ready to eat
what do you want to drink Abe
wanna big glass of milk
oh Ann I just have this feeling that these tacos are going to be so good
I don't know
this one batch isn't
that's okay
I'll eat that last
you're not supposed to reach
what are you reaching for
shit you had your hand right over it
Abe that is really tricky
you're such an actor
that is just about the trickiest way of snitching lettuce that I've ever seen
you little trickster Abe
hey is it time to eat
Abe if you have anything important that you want to say say it now
because it's time to turn the tape off
