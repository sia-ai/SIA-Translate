with one bite of this poisoned apple Snow white's eyes will close forever
the only cure for the sleeping spell was love's first kiss
as soon as the dwarves went to work the queen disguised as a peddler woman approached Snow white
the forest animals recognized the queen and ran off to warn the dwarves
but by the time the dwarves arrived it was too late
Snow white had already taken a bite of the poisoned apple and
she took a bite of that xxx apple and she fell asleep
oh my
the evil queen fled from the cottage but the seven dwarves raced after her and chased her to a rocky cliff
well the the seven dwarves are angry at the witch because she's not very nice to Snow white
well the seven dwarves are nice they're just angry
a rock broke beneath her feet and the queen fell from the mountaintop into the darkness below

dear Puds gone for a walk be back soon Toot
P S I'll cut the grass when I get back
hm
Puddle cut the grass
xxx at lunch time there was still no sign of Toot
maybe he went fishing said Tulip the bird
but we always go fishing together answered Puddle
where is Toot that's the question
dinner time came and Toot still wasn't back
he never misses dinner Puddle says
ooh this is delicious said Tulip Toot would love it
Toot Puddle called into the woods
is he lost asked Tulip
you can't get lost in your own woods said Puddle
when it grew dark Puddle really began to worry
what if Toot tumbled into a hole and couldn't get out
or worse Puddle thought something even worse
what do those look like
xxx puppies maybe they're wolves
I think so
I'd better go search for him Puddle decided he's my best friend
Puddle walked all through the woods and around Pocket Pond and climbed to the top of Orchard Hill searching for his friend
Toot he called where are you
aha what do we have here
footprints
Puddle tramped through the dark woods until
the starry sky opened before him
oh Toot loves trains thought Puddle
what do you see
a train do you think Toot
xxx a caboose all the way in the back
do you think that Toot got on the train
I think so too
so Puddle jumped on the train too
chuga choo choo
airport Puddle said
just the other day Toot was saying he hadn't flown anywhere in months
Provence mused Puddle
France
that was one place Toot had never been
I guess he hadn't been to Provence is the country in France but Toot went to Paris in France in the last book didn't he
remember and he loved art he saw the Mona Lisa in Paris
yeah
do what am I doing Puddle asked himself now Tulip would be worried about him too
but his thought came too late
which way would I go Puddle thought if I were Toot
ah Provence was beautiful
but where was his friend
bonjour mon ami Toot cheered
Toot cried Puddle what are you doing here
I guess I got carried away Toot said I hopped on a train and then a bus and then a plane and then a bicycle and then one thing led to another all the way to Kookooposh
I had a whim
how in the world did you get here
the same way said Puddle I went looking for you and one thing just led to another all the way here
that's just how whims are said Toot
isn't it exciting to be in such a far away place Toot asked
Tulip will be worried now that we're both xxx missing said Puddle
there's Toot with his little
yep there's Toot
and there's Puddle
he's talking to the man who works for the uh airport
Tulip will be worried now that we're both mithing missing said Puddle I'd better give her a jingle
I found him Puddle said we're fine we'll be back soon
uh what's Toot looking at
picture of a
very tall mountain in Nepal
they have the highest mountain in the world there Toot said
are you sure this is a good idea asked Puddle
oh I'm sure and they got back on an airplane
phew puffed Puddle that was fun he said when they got_to the top of the mountain
I'll say said Toot
I'm glad we did it together said Puddle
as they hiked down the mountain Puddle was quiet
what's wrong Toot asked are you getting pooped out
I think I'm getting homesick Puddle admitted
that happens to me every time Toot told him I love to go off on a trip and then when the time comes I love to go back home
xxx and there they are back at home
sitting in the
hammock right
should we read your solar system book
okay
right
it's called our solar system
xxx wow
right our solar system
our solar system is made up of a star which we call the Sun
and a group of smaller objects that travel around it
these include the planets one of which is Earth where we live
what
soops oh Jupiter you're right xxx Jupiter
Jupiter there's Jupiter
wow
that is that's right that's Jupiter
do you remember what this one is called
Saturn
this one is Earth where we live
this one is Uranus
and this one is
right
and Neptune
and this little one is Pluto
wow
that's neat
well there's um Mars
and Venus and Mercury
but we're gonna learn about all those okay
okay
these include the planets one of which is Earth where we live
their moons plus asteroids and comets
the solar system was once a cloud of dust and gas that stretched for more than a trillion miles
xxx that's very big
about five billion years ago a nearby star exploded sending shockwaves through the cloud
the cloud the cloud became a slow turning disk and the disk's center shrank and became the Sun
other particles from the cloud stuck together and formed planets which travel in roughly circular orbits around the Sun
planets near the Sun are small and rocky
and those are that are far
those farther away are larger and made mostly of gas
xxx here's the Sun
wow the Sun is more than a million times larger than the Earth
it's a huge ball of hydrogen and helium gases
wow that's pretty neat
Mercury you wanna learn about the planets
okay
Mercury is a small rocky planet
it's right here
it is closer to the Sun than any other planet and travels around the Sun
Pluto
Pluto that's right
it's closer to the Sun than any other planet and travels around the Sun in only eighty eight Earth days
Mercury's surface is filled with craters made by space rocks that crashed on to its surface
whoa xxx
I love you
the planet has a very thin atmosphere and temperatures can rise
Jupiter
can rise to more than eight hundred degrees
that's Mercury
yeah
yeah
the Sun xxx
but it can be hundreds of degrees below zero during the long nights
wow
neat
xxx Venus
there's Venus
right
Venus is about the same size as the Earth but would not be pleasant to visit
that is our
that's the Moon
the Moon
the Moon
wow
the very tiny Moon
this is interesting Honey
well that's our big Moon
it just looks tiny in the picture next to the planet
yeah
the atmosphere is so dense on Venus you would feel like you were under water
hm
wow
thick red clouds hold in the terrible heat
if you were on Venus you would feel like you were under water
wow
as far as we know Earth is the only planet that has life
that's Earth where we live
wow
on Earth
xxx on Earth
Earth's
hm I don't think anybody lives on Jupiter
because it's very very cold out there
Gabby lives on Earth too look the Moon
see
wow the Moon is Earth's satellite
there's Earth
that's right
wow
wow that is so neat
in nineteen sixty nine human astronauts landed on the Moon's surface for the first time
the astronauts could see the Earth shining in Moon in the Moon's black daytime sky
because the Moon's atmosphere is very thin its sky remains black even when the sun shines
hm Mars
Mars has long been called the Red Planet
wow
xxx Tamar lives on Earth
we all live on Earth
it's true wow
Mars
right
millions of years ago the atmosphere was thicker and warmer rain fell and rivers flowed
space probes have sent photographs of the dry riverbeds and some water may still be frozen in the soil
wow
on Mars the temperature may reach eighty degrees at the equator on a summer day but at night it is colder than anywhere on Earth
scientists hope to visit Mars in the early two thousands
that would be so neat
that's a picture of Earth
of Mars
I think that is the neatest thing
right it's a whole other planet and we have pictures of it
this is a little car that drove on the surface of Mars
it's called Sojourner
right
Sojourner yep
oh the asteroid belt look at that see all these little tiny rocks
yeah
the asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter
yeah
belt
belt an asteroid belt
wow
that's neat
ooh when asteroids come too near Earth they usually burn up
sometimes a fragment does reach the ground leaving a large crater
look at that a little asteroid hit the Earth and made this huge crater
that is so neat
right
xxx look what planet are we on
Jupiter
I mean we're not literally on it we're just reading about it
Jupiter is very different from the planets near the Sun
we we live on Earth
we're reading about Jupiter now
we're on the Jupiter page
Jupiter is very different from the other planets near the Sun
it's much larger it's eleven times the size of Earth
and has thirteen hundred times the volume
but Jupiter is also much less dense
the asteroid hit
right you're right
Jupiter makes one rotation every ten hours
winds at the equator travel at more than three hundred miles an hour
one huge hurricane like disturbance
called the great red spot
is very very large
it's a storm that has been raging for at least three hundred years
we're not having cookies now Honey
Jupiter has moons too look at this
hi look at this moon it's called Io
hello what are you doing
baby ghost
baby ghost did you see this moon of Jupiter's
t's called Io
and this is called Europa
Callisto
and Ganymede
that's Europa
Io
Callisto
and Ganymede
those are all moons that travel around Jupiter
neat huh
and here's Saturn
wow
yeah here's Uranus and Neptune
right
that's right did you know
see these rings around Saturn Honey
they're made up of particles of ice
isn't that neat
here's Uranus
wow
to telescopes on Earth Uranus looks like a small green disk without any surface features
it is twenty times farther away from the Sun than Earth and it spins on its side
it is a gas giant like Saturn
but beneath its deep atmosphere is a giant ocean of liquid or icy water
deep under the ocean there may still be a rocky center
and here's Neptune
it's a hazy blue planet
that's Uranus
and that's Neptune with these kinda stripes on it
wow
xxx has rings right
and look Triton
that's Triton
let's see what Triton is
hm it's Neptune's largest moon Triton
and there's little Pluto
yeah it's dark every day on Pluto
yeah every day is a dark day on Pluto because the Sun is so far away
it can only be seen with a powerful telescope because it is both the most distant planet in our solar system and the smallest planet
wow

recycling
a recycling truck carries away trash but this trash will not go to a dump

okay
hm
wow what book is that
wow the rainbow goblins
once there was a land that lived in fear of seven goblins
they were called the rainbow goblins and each had a color that was also his name
Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo and Violet
well let's look at the animals first
what animals do you see
mhm right
and
zebras right
right
and I think this might be antelopes
maybe rhinoceros
rhinoceri
big deer
yeah
huh
yeah you think that's a jaguar
maybe
wow
I think you might be right
okay
uh there are the goblins trying to get to the valley to steal the rainbow
did we see a rainbow while we were driving
oh boy let's see if they catch it
the sun had almost set by the time they reached their goal
you think so
wow
oh in the sky
they're gonna try and catch it but I don't think so I think that you can't catch a rainbow
well that's a good thing because if they caught the rainbow no one would be able to see the rainbow and wouldn't we all be sad
we don't want the goblins to steal the rainbow right
no
we'll spend the night here in the cave the yellow goblin commanded
when the moon rose and saw them warming themselves around the fire they had lit it shouted out an alarm
the rainbow goblins are in the valley
the trees and the bushes took up the cry and the flowers and the grasses and the animals and the waters passed it on and by midnight the evil tidings had spread throughout the valley
look at the big beautiful moon
the goblins could hardly contain their excitement
soon all the colors of the rainbow will be ours Yellow gloated
we'll snatch it as it rises when the colors are still fresh and creamy
the blue goblin cackled look at the roots dangling from the walls they're straining to hear our plans
a lot of good it will do them or their friend the rainbow
finally exhausted by their scheming the goblins fell asleep
outside the moon shone on the mirror like surface of the water and its magical light was reflected in the cave
then all seven goblins had a wonderful dream
mhm
mhm
wow
yeah I know I don't see orange in this picture but I bet it's in there somewhere
right doncha think
yeah

the goblins had a wonderful dream about the paradise of rainbow land where all you had to do was lie on your back and open your mouth

and the most succulent colors dripped down your throat
