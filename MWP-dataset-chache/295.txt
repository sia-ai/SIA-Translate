I guess nobody's here

I guess it was Rolley making that noise
Rolley
yeah
yeah
Mister_Rolley
all right
tell the tape who Rolley is
ah you just scared our kitty off
yeah I know
you shouldn't scare her
I didn't mean to
who's Rolley
oh Rick and Paula's dog
mm hm
and what does Rolley do that is so funny
and Rolley's dad Mister Rolley's dad bought a statue of Rolley
bought a what
a statue of Rolley
a sketch of Rolley
a statue of Rolley
a statue he did
cool
well it was when he was a tiny baby and he's holding xxx he was holding a chain
he was
yeah
it had words on it
it had worms on it
so so it
a word words
words yeah
you thought worms
so wait what does Rolley do that's so funny
swim in the water
yeah after what
he
what
after he is pushing on his balls
yeah with his tennis balls right
yeah
because who throws them out there
in the water
Rick and Paula throw them out there in the water huh
yeah
and then Rolley goes and does what off the dock
kabounce
he jumps in the water and swims
yeah
we should you should see Rick and Paula xxx
I've seen them
you should watch that dog swim
he's a good swimmer
yeah
and last weekend when you were swimming what was Rolley doing
or not Rolley uh that's right who else what other dog swims
Java
Java
Java right
and Mister Jim's dog
and when you were swimming with Java what was he doing
pulling tail
from the tail
he was pulling people with his tail
yeah
what would he do on the dock
kabounce
he'd kabounce
so he'd climb up the stairs right
yep
and then you and Java would jump in the water
yeah
yep
how did I jump when I was a baby
when you were a baby
you didn't jump
we held you in the water
uh you guys threw me in the water
hm Daddy probably caught you if we threw you
not when you were a little baby but when you were a little bit older
when I was two
yeah
you threw me in the water when I was two
well Daddy caught you in the water
when I was two you used to threw me
mm hm
and sometimes you can't catch me and you splood right to the fish
no we caught you
you did
we wouldn't let you go to the fish would we
uh yes
we would
we'd let the fish have you
yep
what would you do with the fish
eat them
you would eat the fish
yep
under the water
yep
I would eat every single one
you would
yeah
and then who would be under the water with you
if you eat all the fish you wouldn't have any friends down there would you
no
if you went and lived with the fish
yep
I would swim all the way back to my dad
you would swim back to your daddy
yeah
you do that now huh
you're a good swimmer
right
yeah I wish we were in the water
well why aren't we
because
because why
it's cold outside
mm hm
it's cold out and it's cloudy huh
tomorrow we can probably do it
I dunno maybe with Grandma you can
or Papa
Papa will be working
who's gonna go in Grandma just can't do it by herself
I know because she's gotta watch Lindsey too huh
she can hold her and I can do anything I want like jump
well then no because if something happened to you Grandma wouldn't wouldn't be able to watch both of you at the same time
while you swam and then hold baby Lindsey
that'd be dangerous
if I swam right acrossed I would swim back to her
I dunno
I would too
yeah but that would be dangerous so I'd rather I doubt Grandma would have you swim tomorrow
strangers don't swim
no but strangers that's not what would be dangerous about the water strangers strangers they um the water would be dangerous because you might drown and we don't want you to drown
I don't do
anyway I don't have an inner tube
you can swim without an inner tube huh
