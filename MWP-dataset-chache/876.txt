for you my little redhead we need this suntan lotion
you see this
that's what we gotta get for you
most baby or child formulated sun+screens are gentle on sensitive skin
test a small amount on the inside of the baby's wrist
before using it over
over her face and body
choose a hypoallergenic or xxx cream or lotion
gels may contain alcohol which can dry the skin
yeah
that
that
hey I was reading that
I was reading that
lemme finish
which is it
what else should we know
look for an S_P_F of at least fifteen
for protection against U_V_A and U_V_B rays
even water or persistent perspiration
oh
resistant sun+screen should be reapplied regularly especially if baby becomes will be in the water
hey
that's Daddy's
that's probably the only one we probably shouldn't rip up
