how much is five plus ten plus five
I know one you can't get
how much is five times five
well how much is six times five
well I'm going to have_to get an even harder one than that
how much is thirty minus fifteen
well we better get into more higher math then think so
well let's see you've answered all the questions that I've asked you
let's see if you can ask some questions ask me some questions that I can't answer
that would be a million times a thousand
is that a billion
haha
I think it's a million
well that's getting kind of ridiculous let's answer one that I can work in my or let's ask one that I can work on in my head

well tell me what you all do in Sunday school
since Mommy knows your teacher
because I'm gonna ask you
I wasn't there Sunday John
three weeks ago
you weren't there
you weren't there the last time I was there
that must have been the night you spent the night at Grandmommy and Granddaddy's
was that the Sunday you made valentines
what are you working on now John
I mean right now here on your lego set are you rearranging it
building something else
did you and Daddy talk about your tornado nap awhile ago
did you
oh you already talked about it
okay
well you can go ahead and start playing that game if you want to
okay which game do you want to play
well we could work on your activity book
you want to do something in your activity book
some of those word games
well why don't we do some of those that would be better
okay okay we're going to need a pencil you got a pencil John
I don't know if I can hear you
okay an extra pencil please
I only have a pen
that oughta work
okay
okay John
okay the X_man fill in is that what we're going to do
okay why don't you read me the directions and I'll see what we're supposed to do
okay ah this is like the cross+word puzzle right you have_to figure out where all these words go
okay can you read them
okay then so we have_to find the place where that's going to fit in
okay
uh huh makes like a cross+word puzzle
this is a different kind of cross+word puzzle
well we have_to see how many words have four spaces in them and I think I only see one place
can you find it look around and see it's going down
no see that's a whole word right there that'd be too big
what about right there
yeah but it will when we get them all filled in see they're going to all go together
see in this kind of cross+word puzzle they don't give you the clues they just give you the words but you have_to figure out where they go
okay well you can check that one off
right just so you know you did it okay now pick another word that see they've got them separated into how many letters are in the word
okay now we're going to have_to look around for a
that's right
and what does it end in
okay that must be it okay
okay there's one more with five letters
that's teens
that would be like if you're age thirteen to nineteen you would be in your teens
a teenager
I don't know why that's in there
it looks like a kind of strange word for superheroes doesn't it
maybe so but if you look around there will be one more word with five letters in it
one more word a five letter word can you find where that is
uh huh
okay well all those four have seven letters so_that might be a little harder because you're going to have_to figure out the right place to put it
okay that's seven letters so that'll be a hint
it could be either that one or that one couldn't it
well let's see where the other seven letter ones are
well it's going to be hard I tell you what let's figure out what word this is
it will give you a hint find a word down there that starts with a c
one two three four five six seven it has eight letters
there's only one word with eight letters isn't there
that's Colossus
is that a person in superheroes
you never heard of that one
okay I'll write that one down
see then this is going to give you a hint um the other words that go across this way
one two three four five six seven
okay so one is here seven letter words that will go in there
which one would that be
the fourth letter has_to be the f doesn't it
okay what word is this
Banshee is that in superheroes
