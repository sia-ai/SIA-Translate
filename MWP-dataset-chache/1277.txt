like a suit of armor a crab shell protects it from attackers
a crab has two claws for holding and tearing food and for fighting
if a crab's claw breaks off a new one grows back
a crab's eyes are on stalks and can move in all directions
when a crab grows too big for its shell the shell splits and the and the crab climbs out of it
the crab then grows a new shell
crabs live along the coastlines in cracks and under plants
in tide pools or in burrows in sand
look at this guy

a crab walks quickly moving sideways
on its eight back legs
some crabs hide by covering themselves with plants and other objects
