yes
I'm just gonna put it over here okay
while I take a sip of my coffee
wow what's this
a ferris wheel
oh a carousel yes it's true
after the zoo we explored the park and found a carousel
I chose a big black horse with a lion saddle
it wasn't like riding a real horse but it was kind of fun anyway
the horse went up and down when the music started
I had three rides
when I bought my last ticket the man told me that my horse's name was Bubbles
I thought that was a silly name for a big black horse with a roaring lion saddle
hm hm
when I wanted to get a birthday present for my friend Martin my parents said they were going to the twenty sixth street antiques fair and that I could look for one there
they had a lot of antique toys like a china dog and a wooden horse but I didn't think Martin would really like those
I did find him some old baseball cards for his collection though
Mommy used to work right around here
it's true
yeah the twenties
on Martin's birthday I invited him to come with me on an expedition
first we went to Di Yauto's for cheesecake his favorite dessert
who loves cheesecake
I do love cheesecake hm hm
my mother said they had the best cheesecake in New_York
Mario Yauto has owned the bakery for fifty years and his baby picture is still on the boxes
his grandchildren work there in little aprons
dogs were everywhere because a fancy dog show was going on across the street
I like the dobermans and a little black bulldog
there's the dobermans and there's the little black bulldog I guess
oh xxx I think that is a cat
where's the little black bulldog I wonder
xxx have you and Daddy already discussed this
no
that one's not a bulldog you're right
xxx thanks for setting me straight on that one Sweetie
yeah xxx
yes Honey
you want some more strawberries
should I get them now or should I read some more first
read some more first
okay
do you know what this is
is it a big boat
what's it called
after cheesecake we went to the Intrepid
a real aircaft war aircraft warrior from world war two
you can see where kamikaze planes crashed into it
yikes
the fighter jets are real too you can climb up platforms and look inside them
it was a very cold windy day and we had the whole huge deck almost to ourselves
Martin ran around acting and sounding like a plane until other people came out so then we went inside
we got_to work the controls in the simulated cockpit with pilot and copilot seats
and Martin loved it
uh
woo
look at that do you remember what the name of that building is
that's the Empire state building
the next week we went to the observation deck of the Empire state building
we stepped onto it just at that magical moment when the city and bridge lights are on but the sky still has some of the sunset in it and it's not quite dark
you could see so far
in the painting we are looking north with the Hudson river on our left and the East river on our right
the small green square in the distance is Central park
here we go wow
ah look there's Central park
yup
mhm
that's the Hudson river and the East river
some birds flying
Martin's mother was curious about these expeditions of ours so for our next one we went to Wall street where she works
we met her on the spot where George Washington was sworn in as our first president
do you remember where you saw a thing about George Washington
Liberty's kids right
do you know who used to work right around Wall street
actually who used to work on Wall street
that's right Daddy used to work on Wall street

on the fourth of July we went to the harbor
we saw buildings from before the revolution and a little lighthouse memorial to the Titanic
it has a ball on top that drops down exactly at noon
sailors used to set their clocks by it
then we took a boat to the statue of liberty

just before school started we spent the whole day playing in Central park where a kid told us that grand central has a whispering room
he said if we stood in opposite corners and whispered into them we'd be able to hear each other perfectly but no one else could
so of course we wanted to try it
the picture shows us running to grand central
behind us my mother is talking about the Chrysler building
it's my favorite building in New_York it's so beautiful look she was taying to us
she alta also was telling us that the ceiling of grand central used to be so dirty that it was black

I saw the dinosaurs at the American museum of natural history with my class at school
and then again with my mother
the huge one in the painting is a Barosaurus
my mother gave got me a postcard that tells what all the parts of a dinosaur's names mean
for example dino means terrible and sauros means lizard
when I went with my mother we saw the terrible lizards and then we went upstairs to something I thought was even more interesting
huge extinct animals
my favorite was
oh is yours the saber+tooth tiger hers is the giant sloth
they're both great though right
and remember when we went to the museum of natural history we also saw the skeleton of
do you remember with the y shaped horn on the top of its head
in your book of extinct animals prehistoric animals
Brontotherium right
remember that with that big y shaped yeah we saw one of those last time
the giant sloth was much taller than I am
and standing on its hind legs with its fore legs reaching out at you
nice y
I made a w
good one
my w likes your w
um let's see I also like the saber+tooth tiger and the fossilized horse
that's what you said you're right
you are a smart four year old
hm hm
the fossilized horse which was much smaller than horses are now
the sign explained how horses evolved eh and said they've changed much less than many other mammals
when we were done we decided to have a snack in the plaza on our way to the rose center
mm
the lights at the bottom of the plaza's fountain are arranged like the stars in Orion
real astronomers work here and everything is about space
the huge sphere represents the
what's the really big one
what is that supposed to be
that's supposed to be the sun
the bottom one is the big bang the bottom theater is the big bang theater
you look down into a swirling simulation of the universe
the top one is the planetarium the dome darkens and stars come out the way they do at night
remember which planet this one is
Jupiter and remember this one with the rings
Saturn
you are right
this one is Neptune I think

Uranus
where's little Pluto
oh

but I like the sacred animals and the little charms like the turquoise hippopotamus what's his name
William
who has a collection of little Williams
that's right
the turquoise hippo that protected a person in his next life from being attacked by real hippos
they have lots_of other things in the Met it's huge but my mother believes that you enjoy museums more if you don't try to see too much on one visit
the next week we took the subway up a hundred and twenty fifth street in Harlem
someone was selling little sweet potato pies right on the sidewalk and we each got one
yummy Mommy wants a sweet potato pie

I liked the African prints because of the colors and I liked the smell of the incense burning
that's an elm tree that once grew in front of an old theater
people hoping to work in show business business used to touch it for good luck
when the city chopped down the tree the owners of the Apollo theater bought the biggest slab and put it on a pillar in front of the stage
on amateur night people touch it for luck before they perform
it's completely smooth from so many people touching it over the years
wow that's neat
I guess that's a different tree
oh it is that one
mm+kay
during school there was less time for expeditions and I didn't go on another one until Halloween
I went trick or treating with Martin but his mother wouldn't let him come to the grown+up Halloween party in Greenwich village so I went with just my parents
