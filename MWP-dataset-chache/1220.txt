big tail
and you could you also say
the macaque has a long tail
and the elephant has a short tail
a short tail
is that a lion or a duck
I know that what I said it was
but look at its feet
I think it's a duck Naima
I think it's a duck lion
could we call it
could we call it Lionel
that could be the duck's name
Lionel
or do you wanna give the duck a different name
Koalaba
I think I'll rewind this a bit to double check it xxx xxx
where'd it go
where did the macaque tail go
oh let's see
that's a pretty good view of the couch
it's time to read
where's
what
Arthur
let's read over here for a little bit
let's look at the Yoka book

very good
Arthur
what is this on your pants by the way
fuzz
you had fuzz on your pants
okay what's going on here
let's see
oh_my_goodness is Arthur gonna baby+sit
that means he's gonna take care of those children
Arthur is here walking past his friends
he's telling them I'm going to take care of those twins
who is that
what kind of ears does that animal have
what kind of animal is that
is it a rabbit
oh let's see what's happening in this picture
oh_my_goodness
that baby's diaper is leaking
you can see the drops of pee+pee coming out of the diaper
and Arthur is
Arthur's pants got all wet
yeah I think that baby's diaper is leaking
he needs a new diaper
I think the baby is crying
and that's D_W
she's crying in that picture
and what's happening in that picture
that baby's throwing up
remember you threw up when you were sick
I think she is sick
she's throwing up some green stuff that came out of her tummy
that's what happened to you when you were sick
you were throwing up also
yeah sometimes it was orange
that's what the baby's throwing up
because she's sick she needs to have some medicine maybe
and here's a picture of Arthur and his sister D_W
she's jumping on the sofa
Arthur's trying to read a book
his sister's making a lot of noise
that's Mrs Tibble
she has to go out
xxx xxx
the cat looks like she's hiding
yup she might
well D_W's not in this picture
there's D_W
okay you wanna look at this page
D_W's jumping on the sofa
that's Arthur who's holding the crying baby
that's his sister I think
oh she's having pee+pee come out of her diaper
it's leaking
she needs her diaper changed
Arthur has to change her now
she's throwing up
that's Arthur
he's saying yuck
let's see what happens next
those children are playing very rambunctiously
yes Arthur is holding the throwing up baby
Arthur's holding the baby who is throwing up
I think maybe he's trying to help her feel better
hm I wonder where Daddy is
he was supposed to come home
maybe he's reading his paper at work
that's D_W
she's crying
her overalls
she's wearing a dress that looks like overalls
what is she doing
she's laughing
there's all of Arthur's friends
are you saying to Mommy to read some
Arthur remembered what that was like
now he was really worried
there I read it
I think that that
can you read the letters there on that book that D_W was reading
what letters are those
can you see them
oh you wanna talk about that picture with the babies throwing up
do you think Arthur might give her some medicine to help her feel better
yeah
there he is
he's her big brother
do you want me to talk about that picture
that's the picture where the baby's diaper is leaking and Arthur's pants are getting wet
see how the pants are dark on his thighs
that means the baby's diaper leaked
the baby's diaper leaked and made Arthur's pants all wet
I think he probably will get another diaper for that baby
and he will probably also change his pants
what thing away
those green things are the throw up that is coming out of the baby's mouth
oh you think he'll clean it up
yeah you're right
he'll probably clean it up
he'll probably get a wet rag and clean it off of this chair
clean the green throw up off of the chair
and then put the rag in the laundry or throw it away
I think he will because he's the one who's taking care of the baby
when you're taking care of someone who's sick you do that kind of thing
you clean up the throw up and stuff like that
she is throwing up
I bet she doesn't feel good
she probably feels lousy
I'm so glad you're better though Naima
Naima is all better
what happened with the nurses
in the hospital
they did a lot of things to take care of you
well
they put a special bangle on your arm which had blue tape on it
and they connected a hose to your hand
so that you could get the medicine that you needed
they checked to make sure you had enough medicine
well they took your temperature
by sticking that thermometer in your ear
they took your temperature
they listened to your chest with a stethoscope
one of the nurses gave you a grizzly+bear
it was Janet who gave you the grizzly+bear
I think Barbara did take off the blue bangle
which was like a bandage
she took off the blue sticky tape that was on your arm
she took out the needle
there was a needle
she took it all off
oh and you had a bangle on your ankle also
that's right and she took that off
I think that had your name on it
you had that bangle on your ankle too
I forgot that
and you had some kind of a special night+gown
what was it
what was on it
was it bears
what was on the night+gown
uh
I think maybe it was little bears
little pink bears
and
mm
oh you're right it was elephants
you had the special elephant night+gown when you were at the hospital
and there was a special crib there
do you remember that crib
and Mommy slept next to you
on that chair
next to your crib right
and Mommy nursed you too to help you feel better
remember
you were sick yeah
well um
the book fell down that was on my lap
the nurses brought food for Mommy to eat
they took away your diapers after I changed you and they weighed them
on a scale
a scale is for finding out how heavy something is
it measures how heavy something is
we weighed Naima too
we weighed you
you weighed twenty five pounds
again
we already talked about it
who's throwing up
mm who is the baby's brother
Arthur

you wanna turn the page and see what else happens in this story

but more importantly yeah
yeah her
longer term her
uh
xxx xxx
yes
and I don't know you know what the solution is
obviously these guys are in a rush
yeah
well I can call and just mention it to them at least
so that it doesn't go completely um
you know
looks like you're outta food there
do you want something else to eat Naima
whatd'ya think
I don't think that we're out of it but I do think that you could have something else
like
raisins
or what else
is that what it feels like
your hair was a little outta control there
how about some bread with
oh how about some bear food Naima
are you a bear cub that wants to eat bear food
or you could have some egg yolk
I'm the mommy bear
and you're the baby bear
Poppa_Bear
the story of Goldilocks
I need to tell you that while you're eating
what are you gonna eat
you're gonna have some fresh grated apple
does that sound good
I can do that but what are you gonna eat while I'm telling it to you
I will tell it to you but you've got_to be eating something
okay
it's a deal egg yolk and egg white
yes
good idea Naima
first I'm gonna take the shell off of the egg
mhm
because we don't eat the shell with the eggs
how do you spell egg
it does have a g in it
egg is spelled
e g g
this shell does not want to come off this egg
it's difficult and Mommy's having a tough time with this egg
you think Daddy will do it if Mommy can't do it
hm
while I'm doing it it's just a
I didn't cook the egg properly
that's why the shell is sticking to the egg
like tape
yes tape sticks to photographs sometimes
especially in the book we made for you called Naima's journeys right
is that what you're thinking of
alright let's see here
let's slice this egg for you
should we get a plate maybe
what color plate's that
here's some egg white
here's some egg yolk
mm big chunks of egg yolk
they look like chunks of cheese
go ahead and eat some and I'll tell you the story of Goldilocks
once upon a time there was a little girl who went on a walk in the
forest
she saw a snake
you like that variation don't you
she saw a snake
she saw a robin
she saw a badger
she liked walking in the forest
so that she could see all the different animals
she was having fun but she was walking for a long time
and then she got tired
and she first she found the house
a house up ahead
she was hungry and tired
so first she decided to knock on the door
knock knock knock
but there was no answer
so she walked in the house
and then what happens next
what does she
she wants to find the bears
what does she see when she walks in the house
three chairs yes three rocking chairs
a big one
a medium sized one
and a little one
and then
she sat in the biggest rocking chair
and she started to rock and rock
but then she stopped
and she said this rocking chair is too
fast
so she climbed out of that rocking chair
she got into the next rocking chair and that was the medium sized rocking chair
and she rocked
and she stopped and she said
wait a minute this rocking chair is too what
slow
so what did she do
she climbed out of that rocking chair
and
she climbed into the little rocking chair
and she rocked
and she said oh hey
I like this rocking chair
it's just right for me
and then what happens
she's rocking in that little rocking chair for a long time right
she rock and she rocked
until it broke into bits
right
and then what happens
she wants to fix it
well she's a little girl she doesn't really have access to tools and screws
and she's in somebody else's house
she doesn't know where they keep their tools so she can't fix it
so she goes into the kitchen because she's hungry
I think you're right Naima
I'm slicing a bagel
because that's what I'm going to eat for breakfast
a bagel's like an o isn't it
so she goes into the kitchen and she sees
xxx what does she see on the table there
yes
three bowls of porridge
and one of them is big
and one of them is medium sized
and one of them is
little
she sits down in front of the big bowl of porridge and she takes a bite of it
xxx xxx xxx she says
oh this porridge is too hot
she needs to cool it down
then she goes over to the medium sized bowl of porridge and she takes a bite xxx
she makes a face like this
then she says this porridge is too cold
so she gets down outta that chair
she goes to the littlest bowl of porridge
she takes the spoon dips it in the porridge then sticks it in her mouth and takes a bite
xxx xxx xxx
and that porridge was just right
that's right Naima you know this story don't you
where's Mommy's coffee
and
and then she keeps eating the little bowl of porridge
and she eats and eats
until what happens
she finishes it
that's right until it's all gone
and then she wants to wash her bowl off
okay and so then she takes the bowl and she takes it over to the sink
she puts some soap on it and she uses a sponge
and she washes off the bowl until it's all clean
it might've been that she wanted to dry the bowl
and cook more porridge what a good idea
mommy bear
is Goldilocks mommy bear
I don't think so
she's in the bears' house though
she's in the bears' house
she washes the bowl and she puts it back
she doesn't cook more porridge I don't think so
not in this story anyway
she's tired right
so she should find a bed to sleep in
she goes upstairs and she climbs into the biggest bed that she sees
and she tries to get comfortable
and she says uh wait a minute this bed is too hard
she can't get comfy it's not a comfy bed for her
and then what happens
and then she climbs out of that bed and goes into the medium sized bed
she tries to get comfortable
xxx xxx xxx
I can't get comfortable
she says this bed is too soft it's like sleeping on a big fluffy pillow
and then she gets out of the medium sized bed and she goes over to the littlest bed of all
what happens
she's in the littlest bed and she says mm oh this is so comfy
this bed is just right
and she falls asleep
the medium sized bed is the one that's too soft
the littlest bed the little bed that's right
the little bed is the one that is very very comfy
she falls asleep
and pretty soon what happens
the bears come home to their house
they walk in the door they want to rock in their chairs
they go into the living room and papa bear sits in his chair and he starts to rock
and he rocks a couple of times and then he stops
and he says somebody's been rocking in my chair
he's very puzzled
I think you're right
I think Goldilocks has been rocking in the Poppa_Bear's chair
and then
and the mama bear goes and sits in her chair
right
she starts to rock and what does she say
she says somebody's been rocking in my chair too
mhm I think you're right
yes Goldilocks is still sleeping upstairs at this point
and then the baby bear goes over and
there's a bird over at the feeder Naima
birds are coming to eat
can you see them
there's a lot of sun in this room
there now you're out of the sun
can you see the birds
oh maybe they'll come back
you rearranging your cups
hey you ate a lot of that egg good job
what else would you like to eat
sesame
okay let me find the sesame for you
would you like a pile of sesame right here
here's a pile
well I forgot to buy jam at the store yesterday
we're almost out of strawberry jam
what else would you
you're eating the sesame is it good
good
do you wanna eat some apple+sauce Naima
I'll get you some apple+sauce
you want bread and jam
you can have some of my bagel
there's no more jam right now
do you want apple+sauce too
okay
you want some plain bagel
I think there's
what happened to that
uh yeah you can have some of my plain bagel
let's see here
this is Mommy's plain bagel
and I can get you some apple sauce
oh yeah the other part of the story um
where did we leave off
the baby bear looked at his rocking chair
and it was broken
and he said someone's been rocking in my rocking chair and they broke it
ugh he was kinda mad I think
so then
mama bear said don't worry we'll fix it
and then where do the bears go
into the kitchen
because they're hungry
they've been out walking so they're hungry too just like Goldilocks was
when you walk for awhile you get hungry
they've been walking for a long time
um so the papa bear looked at his bowl he didn't even have_to take a bite
he just looked at his bowl and said somebody's been eating my porridge
oh no there's an uhoh here
yes I think Goldilocks was the one eating his porridge
I hope your elbow hasn't been in the way over here
let's attach this over here
and then the mama bear also says
somebody's been eating my porridge too
I think you're right
and the baby bear looks at his bowl which is completely clean remember because she washed it out this time
and he says somebody's been eating my porridge
and she ate it all up
she washed out the bowl and it's completely empty
I think maybe the baby bear starts to cry at this point
do you think so
and the papa bear says don't worry we'll make you some more porridge
so the bears ate all their porridge
then when they were done eating they went upstairs to take a nap
you're having sesame with apple+sauce mm
who likes the bagel in her porridge
oh
she likes bagels with porridge mm
hm I'm just remembering something
okay
they go upstairs and the papa bear says somebody's been sleeping in my bed
the story of the day
I'm still telling the Goldilocks story
you mean you wanna hear what we did yesterday
okay
um yesterday was Wednesday
we woke up
Mommy made coffee
and in the morning we went out and did errands
we went to the bank
we went to the hardware store
we bought a rake at the hardware store just for you
and then we went to the
dry cleaner's
we stopped in the shoe store for a minute
we stopped to make sure that your shoes were still the right size
that was very quick we didn't stay there for very long
you have cold feet
