yeah that was his ghost

yeah he had been burned and it was the end of the movie and Lu uh Anakin Skywalker who used to be Darth Vader turned back to good
mhm

good story though huh
uhuh
who was a monster
no no
Anakin Skywalker
what kind of monster was he
is Darth Vader a monster
well what were you talking about then
oh the emperor guy
do you think the emperor is a monster
thanks
do you think the emperor was a monster
oh
but so who was the monster Mark
let's straighten it out
which one was the monster
Luke
Luke
Luke was a monster
never
rancor monster
which monster was he
was he like um xxx
he did not become a monster
you can't ask how if somebody never did it
that's like saying how did Marky turn into a girl

how did the Ewok turn into a bunny rabbit
he's not a bunny rabbit
but how did the Ewok turn into a bunny rabbit Marky
he doesn't
but how
but how
Mark how come he let me go in come in to see the his blocks now and he wouldn't bef just a moment before
he said because the Ewok had was drinking milk up to his mouth and if you came in you would scare him
and he would spill it
I don't think that was the real reason
I think the reason was that Ross wanted me to come in before and I scared Ross off and then I guess Mark let me in I don't know because he wasn't fighting with Ross anymore
Marky said I didn't woke up when he woke up but I woke up the same time when he woke up
he's referring to the fact that I said we're proud of Ross he woke up so early
and Mark woke up only slightly after Ross
which is to say that they didn't wake up at the same time
is that right Mark
