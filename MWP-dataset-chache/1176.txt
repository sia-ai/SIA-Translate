Franklin goes to school
would you like to come sit next to me
oh alright I thought you might wanna sit a little closer maybe

Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he could zip zippers and button buttons
but Franklin was worried about starting school
and that was a problem because Franklin was going to school for the very first time
mhm

okay I'll be listening for that

Franklin woke up with the sun
it's my first day of school he told Goldie the fish
Franklin packed his new pencil case with a ruler a pencil an eraser and twelve colored pencils that he had sharpened himself
then he woke his parents
look that's Franklin's pink eraser
he has an eraser like yours but yours has a little bee on it
right
right
mhm
right
hurry he said to his parents I can't be late for school
Franklin's mother looked at the clock
even the teacher's not awake she laughed it's too early
you must be very excited said Franklin's father
Franklin nodded
it was so early that there was time to make a big breakfast
you'll need a full tummy to work at school said Franklin's father
Franklin wasn't hungry
I already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs
Franklin's mother gave him a hug
I felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away
Franklin ate a little bit and double checked his book+bag
finally it was time to go to school
halfway to the bus+stop Franklin clutched his tummy
I don't wanna go he said
Franklin's father gave him a hug
that's how I felt when I started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too
that's a good question
is that Beaver's mommy
no it's not
ah I dunno it looks a little more like an otter to me than a beaver doesn't it
yeah let's see
there were there was a big crowd at the bus+stop
there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers
Beaver was carrying her favorite book
I can read it she said
ah it's Franklin's friend Snail
all of it asked Bear
yes Beaver answered proudly
Franklin rubbed his tummy
Rabbit pulled out a brand new notebook
my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said
all of them asked Fox
most of them boasted Rabbit
Franklin looked at his mother
I wanna go home he said
we'll be here after school to hear all about the things you did today she said
when the bus arrived Rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard
Bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again
Franklin hugged his mother and then his father
he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats
as the bus pulled away Franklin looked out the window
he didn't know if he was ready for school
do you think the teacher will yell wondered Rabbit who jumped at loud noises
do you think there's a bathroom asked Beaver fidgeting in her seat
I hope someone has an extra snack said Bear who had already eaten his
Franklin didn't say anything
the bus ride seemed very very long
oh gosh I wonder
I wonder who that could be
maybe
oh could be the otter you're right
right
yeah
or it could be the raccoon too right
there's the raccoon
yeah
I dunno maybe he was sitting in a different seat
oh yes
when they arrived their teacher was waiting
Mr owl said hello in a gentle voice
he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit
he showed them
it looks like they're playing with Playdoh
yeah
he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit
then Beaver and Bear went to the reading and writing center
Rabbit went to the play kitchen
but Franklin stayed in his seat
well we'll have_to ask him
what would you like to do today Franklin asked Mr owl
I don't know said Franklin rubbing his tummy
well he's a lil nervous on his first day of school
I can't write all the numbers like Rabbit can and I can't read like Beaver can
Rabbit and Beaver will learn new things at school and so will you
Franklin started to doodle
I can see you're a very good artist said Mr xxx Mr owl
Franklin stood up
Franklin sat up taller
I know all my colors too he said
what color is this asked Mr owl holding up a colored pencil
it's a special blue said Franklin
it's turquoise
now you've taught me something said Mr owl
is there something special you would like to learn
there were so many things that Franklin wanted to learn that he had trouble deciding
finally he asked Mr Owl to help him read his favorite book
he made a building of blocks
he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures
one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents
it was a wonderful day
Franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home
he bumped up and down ooh don't hurt your boo+boo Sweetie
do you want another bandaid
he was so busy
what do you want
okay can I finish the book and then I'll go get blankie
he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop
his parents were waiting
how's your tummy they asked
Franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy
my tummy's empty he said
well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father
I made this for you said Franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie
and I made this for you said Franklin and gave his parents two pictures and two big hugs

sweet pea we have books in the car
alright
Franklin and the thunderstorm
honey let's not put Silly_Putty in our hair
okay but we don't want it in our hair because we don't want it to get stuck
well then we'd have_to cut it out or something
I know that would that's true but I still don't know if we'd be able to get it out
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
oh great
you know what
I love you
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he could name the months of the year and all the seasons
he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day
Franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms
one day Franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick
maybe I shouldn't go Franklin said to his mother
she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's
Franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella
as Franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air
Franklin felt all jumpy inside
fox was playing outside when Franklin arrived Franklin pointed nervously to the sky I think we should go inside don't you he asked
not yet fox grinned I love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting
I think it's scary said Franklin
is Franklin a lil scared
yeah
beaver snail and hawk came over to play too
my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox
my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed I can smell a storm coming
hm who do you think lives in here
oh snail lives in that little tree stump huh
I think he does
that's a cute little house for snail donchou think
mhm
the wind became stronger and hawk flew loop+de+loops wee he cried
Franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big fat raindrops began to fall
we should go in shouted Franklin
no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree+house where it was dry
do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree+house when it's a thunder storm
no
you could get hurt in a tree+house that's true
fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree
fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said
lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt
right
you sure were right
Franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig_zag light
lightening shrieked Franklin he trembled
thunder he screamed
that's okay Franklin said his friends we're safe here
but Franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still Franklin wouldn't come out
Franklin's friends begged him to play but Franklin stayed put
then with a flash and a crash the lights went out
don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight
won't you come out now she asked Franklin
no thank you said Franklin
don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky
Franklin peeked out really he asked
no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling
Franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked
oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off
fox smiled I think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers
Franklin laughed
giants that's ridiculous said beaver Mister_Owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground
the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder
amazing said Franklin
Franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends
soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped
then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play
look said Franklin a rainbow
I know why the storm is over Franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it
even beaver had to smile
wow
it sure does
look at that
should I make a lil tiny ball
okay
looks kind of like a little egg doesn't it
yeah
wow
