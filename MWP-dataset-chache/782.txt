I had them at school
tugboat

you're the one with all the knowhow
you have_to use the beater
I know
were you playing cowboys at school

they're soldering the metal together
I need to get some more at the co_op

did you tell Mom what happened at school today

what do you want for lunch
okay
I rolled it into a log
we'll saw it and make it into little balls later
uhhuh
yeah but we're going to use a knife
because that's a dirty saw
how do you like shiny floors
because that's a dirty saw
how do you like our shiny floors
oh
what
good deal
I'll check it
I'll check it
oh_no it broke
what Abe
it's up in the freezer Abe
just a second
what
you grow corn
and you squeeze it and get the oil out
then
let me finish cleaning this
okay I'll help you with my broom
where did you get your broom Abe
where did you get your broom
oh
yes I did
I knew I forgot something
honey
you're right
what
what about it
okay
I'll get it
here
what
not today
maybe we can get it before we go camping again okay
what did you do at school today
what
oh what did you do
where did you do that
when
huh
oh can I have a piece of your toast
how about this one
what
okay
what
my name's Oregano
what
I have a hawk name
am I a mean hawk or a nice hawk
I'm a elephant
today
what
okay
I think so here it is
I'm gonna do that
after I show you
did you eat all your toast
how come
be patient Abe
I don't think so
but you can try it
I'll get you a knife
if you want to try
does it taste just like the candy you made at school
you can wash them off when you're done
okay
right
hey Abe what are you doing
I think you forgot to do something
what are you doing with Mom's purse
what
oh you forgot to drink your milk
huh
how come
what would you like to eat
huh
okay
what kind of special tool is that
yeah but you need a special kind to make a new sword
it's a good kind huh
how many cookies
they just like cookies
how come you have cookies for lunch sometimes
yeah what would you do with that spear after we make it
what
what would you hunt
no I don't think they do
what did Chris say
what
in our world
have you ever met a mean butterfly
me either
do you think Chris is right
no
that would kill it
oh would it kill a mean butterfly
have you ever seen a mean butterfly
do you think they really exist
mean butterflies
do you think you need a sword to go out and hunt butterflies
well I'll tell you what
I'll try to fix it after I take a shower
I'm gonna eat now
maybe
they didn't
you think they're dead
I think they're still growing
you'll just have_to be patient
how come you can't catch butterflies with that hatchet
oh I think it's sharp enough to hunt butterflies
how come
oh
good
let me see
it is
huh
huh
no
they might
smaller than that
hm
to the what
what goes way down to the testicles
whose bone
what are testicles
really flat and sharp huh
where did you hear that word
do you
huh
where are they
no
no
no they're part of your penis
you have testicles and a penis
huh
huh
they have a special eye
and they teetee out_of their eye
you don't think that's right
what about girl butterflies
girl butterflies have penises
what goes right up to the sky
I don't know
you haven't asked me yet
that movie
huh
no Godzilla's huge
he's a_lot bigger than an airplane
what
they thought the monster would come to their city and eat it
oh I didn't know that
it's hard to know stuff about monsters isn't it
I think that rock and that stick are too big for a spear Abe
wow that's gonna be hard to find
when did you see that
when did you see the other rocks
how'd it get buried
no it's too heavy
one thing about spears is that it should be carried real easy
that's not the right kind of spear
don't you want to have the right kind
you silly goose maybe we could find a stick and a rock to make you a spear
yeah
I can't make that one work
it won't work
stick the rock where
I think that you could probably find a better rock
maybe later
yeah but it's too wide
you want it what
you just want to be difficult don't you
where're you going
huh
yeah that would be a good size
or we could just look for another rock
we can't dig Abe
the people would get mad at us
maybe somebody else found that rock and took it home
hm
oh then how are we going to find it
I heard a car drive up
I wonder if that's Grandma and Grandpa
oh
yeah
no
no it's light brown
that isn't wood is it
you need wood to make a spear
what
I already have
it has_to be straight first
I can't throw it away
what
what
what
I don't know if they'll let us dig for it
because they're working
and they might not want us to mess up the ground
what if we can't find that rock
okay
no not now I have_to go take a shower remember
which would you rather have
a spear or a lantern
we have_to wait for Grandma and Grandpa
if they came and we weren't here what would they do
you don't think they'd be real disappointed
it means they'd be real sad
what
but who would be home if Grandma and Grandpa come
what
you don't think they're going to come today
then why don't you think they'll come while we're gone
they might
would you like that
what
that's dangerous
would yours have_to have a point
how do you tell if a butterfly's mean
oh isn't there any way to tell before it bites
it's what
I did it with the lock
so nobody would steal it
that's a good idea
maybe we'll have_to wait and see
I'm getting it
do you want it toasted
okay
I do that's a small microphone
upstairs
I just thought I'd use this one today
what time did you get up
what did you do
who was it
that was pretty smart
what happened then
how nice
yeah
yeah
I'll put some of this in
it'll melt
do you want to go a picnic today

okay Abe watch my corn for me while I go upstairs okay

it needs the cover on Abe
so it can cook
I don't think it's gonna burn
look at all the water that's in there
