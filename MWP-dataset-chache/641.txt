Adam these are really very nice flowers
how many cars do you have

how could your hair get sneezy
do you make flowers like that at school
that lady that sleeped

I'm afraid I don't have any juice but you may have a banana
you may give Robin a banana and Ursula a banana if you like to
yes
what
what
I forgot to say that you could have a banana
I didn't
I said Adam you could have a banana and offer Robin and Ursula one would you
don't forget the cover Adam over under the chair
not very well
Robin would you give him a few pieces of paper
sure
in_case you want to carry it with you
you didn't put the top back on the yellow
you hold this down
take a test
what kind of test
oh
will you make a picture of me too
alright
you'd love to be a banana monkey
what
do you want to use another color
don't forget the top

here's the red
I'll blast it off for you
what happened
is that the baby fish
what's your favorite color
a spider
a rainbow
is it
a snail
a shell
it is
you find shells in the bottom of the sea
you could
you don't want a fish what
you could wear a suit to cover you all up
to go under the water
that's what divers do
I saw a movie about it
about men who lived under the sea for three months
how could they
they didn't have enough air
they took their air along with them in tanks they made there own air out_of the water
they went down and explored the bottom
I could show you some pictures of that movie
okay
alright
Robin would you give him some more
do you want me to do it
Adam let's take off one cover at a time alright
no one at a time
it that the air tank
they're all covered in suits
so they don't get wet and they have a plastic thing so even the head doesn't get wet
it's round and you can see through it like a
like a helmet but it covers the face so you wouldn't get wet
no
for going under water it doesn't have holes in it so you don't get wet
you're making him all wet
good
here's a color
what's base
oh
something like gloves
something like boots but like a suit that covers him everywhere
they're already here
yes
they're up there by my purse
good for you for putting all the tops on Adam
my you're hungry
I might just save mine
mhm
I'm not hungry just now
are you
really
can you make some fish under the water
here it is right under your knee
it's still under your knee
try again
is that a test
that's not a test
you can take that out to play with
you can surprise your Mother
she won't know what's in there
would you like some more banana Adam
open it up and take half
I'll show you how much is half
I don't think so
you really think so
let's see what else is in my bag
you want to look at the little book

are you going to finish making yours
alright
who's the teacher
do you know you can bend that mirror
how do you look bent
don't you like the mirror
let me see if it needs cleaning
it does
three legs
no I'm just using a handkerchief
oh isn't that pretty
what is that
is it an apple
is it something you eat
is it a hat
do I know anything like it
alright
I give up
isn't that pretty
oh
isn't it nice
I don't like myself very much
how do you like yourself
is there green
how did you open it when I wasn't in here
Mrs Ursula opened it
Mr come on Adam
Diandra see yourself in there
write a story for us
Adam why don't you write your name
you're not a little what
she'll be surprised
do you want to use the newspaper
I've never seen your name written like that
where's the a
I only see your name one time
all the other times your name is all wrong
Adam put your paper on the newspaper
just use one piece at a time
and you didn't tear it off properly
Mommy
Mommy
where are are you going
then you'll be here all by yourself
would you give him a little piece
that not David
that Robin
what're you making Adam
have you finished with this one
oh no not yet
I didn't have enough boxes
it's a dollar sing
Adam what're you making
could you give us a piece of paper please
it could be the result of a fire but
keep coloring on the back
that's very nice
that very nice
did Robin make that
why not
oh is that Adam's name
let's bring everything over here
what happened to all the crayons
invisible
I don't think so
www and I'll take Paul and Diandra
we talked about it and you said that Mommy could go
I'll be back shortly
leave Paul here
well Paul will probably cry and then Ursula couldn't hear the tape recorder
alright Paul here's one for you
Adam you want to first look here to see all the different kinds of thing you can make
no that's the top
that's the part
these are the things that you build with see because they rest on one another
no no
Adamy don't do that
they aren't swords
what
let's see you build it
it seems to me you place these long ones on top of one another
Paul we might have_to go upstairs hm
what's this
those are building blocks
well this is Paul's
he wants to build
they look like beds
there are no written directions
there's just building there
and you can make your building just like it by just looking at it
you don't have what
please let him have some dear
Adam let him have some please
look behind you Diandra
I think I better take you out
can you build something on there Adam
there's something started
can you find another piece like this Adam
are there any more big ones
let him have some of the little ones Adam
you can have some too
you use these
put some little ones in_between and then it stays better
yes now you can put another long piece on
yes
careful it doesn't fall down
now you do the other side
why is it naughty
he can take some
no he's not
looks like a what
that's a rooftop
here Diandra
let's give him a few more
let's see if we can't make it stand up
I guess that one's too small let's put a bigger one on
did you go to school today
with who
you want to put that one on
what's the matter
your shoe is untied
good and then you can put a roof on
oh yes
what're you doing
that looks high enough Adam
are they both the same so you can put a roof on
I think this needs to be one higher
no Diandra you use those
carefully
very carefully
what're you going to do with them
maybe you could make a floor
look at your building and see
oh we should make some steps
that's a good idea
it wouldn't be so hard to make steps
what
oh yes
you could have an open house and walk in
then you don't need doors and windows but you do need steps
I don't think so
now where we live
what
maybe this house is way out in the country
are you going to have any furniture in the house
furniture
who is going to sleep in the beds
me
I'm too big
alright
Adam do you know what he's saying
not higher than the roof
how could you sleep higher than the roof
I thought we're pretending I'm small
it's a bunk bed
is everything alright
I'm going upstairs because Paul really is very cranky this afternoon alright
you didn't make a gate
a fence
you need two straight pieces
and a_lot_of little pieces
I think they have_to be the double kind
the fat kind
like that
that's a good idea
we'll do that next
right on top
oh that looks good
shall we make a fence all around the house
okay
now you'll be safe
why don't move that over because that might not go over the
the fence
thank_you
isn't that a pretty fence
mhm
okay
we'll fix that Adam that's not too hard to fix
not too hard
here
a mouse
a mouse can't eat me
I'll eat the mouse
it is not
did you see any pictures of the circus
have you been to the circus
now we need one more side
oh that's so pretty Adam
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on
it doesn't need a floor
does it need a roof
maybe it doesn't
yes that's right and that could be the water
you can pretend
make another one and we'll have a race
alright
the boat knocked down a house
let's put everything back first
will you help Diandra
I didn't bring the top
I have my car just outside
it doesn't take very long to get from here to the car
yes it does
it takes very long from Harvard
that's where you used to live
I live near there
I'm in the same place
is that yours
does Diandra have one too
apple Mommy
did you finish yours already
are they all picked up
alright
then maybe Diandra can play with it next
why don't you let Diandra play with the windmill and we'll put this together
Diandra's your mother
alright
be very careful
submarine
bless you
it should
it's supposed to
alright
maybe it's a jet
yes
yes
no
but this is peace time
peace time means there's no war
yes
make it go high
let's see if there's something else to do on it
good for you Diandra
this makes it fly straight I think
oh that's good
it made a loop
oh yes
I see
what's that Paul
no let him look at it
it says
all controls xxx
I don't think there is one
oh yes
I don't think so
Adam close the door please
thank_you Adam
no Diandra
seems you haven't finished playing with that
well put it back in the bag
no in the bag where you got it
it wasn't in the basket
yes
you could draw on it
alright
you look in there and I'll look in here
I don't know what's in that bag Adam
what is it
some what
some what things
is there anything else in that bag
let's sort them out
looks like a corkscrew doesn't it
I had some spaghetti like a corkscrew
yes
this kind
and then I had some
I'll see if I can make the shape
I had some like this
did you ever have that
cereals
you mean Rocky and Bullwinkle have them
no
you mean Rocky the squirrel
you mean Rocky
I don't see television very often so I guess I don't know
yes I can
I just don't know about Rocky
let's see what shall we make
can you
shall I make one for you
what's that
is that your brother
which finger do you want it on
is it too tight
do you want me to fix it
it is too tight
how about this way
oh what's that
let's put up a block so it doesn't go too far
I don't know where
it looks like he's heading for the chair leg
do you want a ring for your other hand
will you make me a ring
that's the right way
no I don't
an airplane
a balloon
a lasso
because you gave me a hint
here see if this fits your other finger
ouch
ouch
I'm not used to sitting on the floor
do you want more
like Ringo
you know who Ringo is
one of the Beatles
make a what kind of spear
mhm
what else shall I make
another ring
really
my car is broken
how come you know I didn't bring my car
did you look out the window and see that it isn't there
my car doesn't work anymore
it won't start at all
what
shall I
what color
that would be pretty
do you want another one
I could make one for every finger if you want
one more
oh one for me
were you at school
of course
who's Kris
is she a special friend
I guess I made it too small
that's very nice Adam
that's a beautiful bow
look at those colors
here's your bow
I don't think I do do you
a bigger one no I don't
how
what's the difference between a spear and an arrow
what about the arrow
that's a very funny thing
you could hang it from the ceiling
shall I make you a necklace
a gun
I certainly don't
that's a bicycle
a big truck
me too
sounds like a motor+scooter to me
what would a lion be doing on your street
I would care
I wouldn't mind if a monkey wakes me up
if a what
car
oh
yes I don't like a clock to wake me up but I don't mind monkeys and I don't mind a kitty
does your puppy wake you up
you would
I'll take them off
we can make some flowers
in your yard
did you plant them
can I see them from here
I'll see them when I go out
no not like this one
I just made this one up
you want to make some too
oh is that your
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to take that
do you go to school all day
in the morning too
I thought maybe you go in the morning and stay and have lunch there
is that how it goes
does Kris go home too
it's a funny flower
isn't it
here's another one
what happened to my flowers
oh no she's here
she's upstairs talking to somebody
must be a gun
me too
oh yes
then we have_to make a sprinkling can
oh yes I can
alright
let's see first how big your wrist is
here's one
no
well I can make
no
no I can make a hammer and a chair
wait a minute
I have_to put this on you
let's try
you have_to ask me when you want it off
you're just going to keep it on
alright
here's your watch
now it can't pinch you
what time is it
eight thirty
that's it right there
aren't you going to keep them on
I'm going to keep mine on
it comes off
you look very elegant
let's put them away
I'm going to keep my ring on too
let's leave the flowers up alright
are there some books in there
do you want to look at them
what're you going to do with the pajamas
what does it look like
a banjo
let's see where it's going to fit
doesn't your mother have one of these
guess
no
guess again
I guess this is going to fit here
try again
we're going to need some crackers and a bowl
do you want to ask your mother for that
a small bowl
let's put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happens
what did it make
it's a grinder
it grinds them up
lots_of what
you can watch it come out here
cracker crumbs
you could put them back through again
a what
a grain thrower
yes or else you could ask your Mother if there is anything else she wants ground up
it comes out like a waterfall
I think maybe that's the last time
watch your fingers
what did you say sugar
yes that's the one
sure and sheep too
go slow
grain fall
I think maybe that's enough
they do
they taste salty and delicious
brush yourself off
let's see if we can rescue some of this alright
that means you can grind this up again
that's a good idea
we'll just pick it up with the paper
look inside and see how you think it works
where does it push it
what way
where does the grain go when you push it
and then
mm
you could make some bread with that
you make bread out_of grain
oh let's take a bigger piece
no
careful
you forgot something
it'll taste like roast beef
mm chicken
what does yours taste like
chocolate
let's make a little funnel
pour it right in
cheese
grapes
careful
watch
well look what happens here
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there
what do you think it does here
how come it gets so small
what do you think it will be like
orange juice
wait Adam
now don't forget to put the bowl back
frost
what's it like
there isn't any
stand up and we'll clean it all off again
alright but first I have_to get it all collected
wait for me
don't go without me
it's all_gone
alright
water
mine tastes like Pepsi_Cola
raspberries
it changes grain into anything you want right
can you make me some strawberries
why do you have_to wait till it gets older
what kind of things do you eat that are older
water's older
that's right
only it gets less every time
oh that's alright
you can
we can use the flower
who's coming down
with the what
what did you call it
the grain what
alright
well let's leave it up alright
I don't know if I have anything else
maybe you'll have_to show me some things alright
what do you think
you better put those back
the pajamas aren't to play with
guess
what do you think
maybe
I do
cherries
maybe I could have a drink but I can't stay for supper
no
why not
we forgot to show your Mother the rings
yes
alright
well I'll take one and you take two how's that
what did we forget
oh
yes
shall I get out the pipe cleaners
yes
it would grind the stick up
yeah but then you couldn't eat the grain anymore
that's right because it'll be mixed with stick
xxx a telescope hm
I'll try
no thank_you
that's a good idea
you make a chain
a chain of flowers
yes it's very old+fashioned
old+fashioned glasses
shall we do that after the telescope
why don't you bake some bread
here's your telescope
here Diandra
yes
I'm making them
oh thank_you
I'm sorry
that I didn't bring you down anything to eat
well we had all those fruits strawberries and cherries remember
oh my_goodness
now I don't have_to get any birthday presents
you do
what time is it
oh yes what shall I do with it
oh it's good
no thank_you
if you want to but I don't want any more
what do you think that was
maybe it was a police car
how do you know how cows eat
how do you know how cows eat
no thank_you
say no thank_you
Adam
just a minute
where shall we put this
you had something to eat
did you tell her what you had in there
buds
oh it's a rosebud I guess
yes
would he be taller than you if you trade chairs
just a minute
alright
would you like to bring your chair over here
have you told her that you're graduating from nursery school
his robe
who made the hats
oh I didn't even know I was supposed to make your hat
xxx out_of cardboard
well I saw them in her office when I took the robe in
let's take the biggest thing first
oh is that the way you know that's rubber
that was very nice of you Adam
I wouldn't be so sure
let me open it
is there a trick to opening this
good
try it on paper
does it work
it's the stamp pad
we may have_to put another drop of ink on there
maybe a drop of water would do
just one drop Adam
what
one fill
you don't need much so you
it won't work if you put too much on there
one more drop
what is that
maybe we have_to use paint
it's too wet isn't it
that must be paper to print on
you can see the outline of it
you could print it right in the book
yes it is isn't it
yes you can even take them apart and print them
one what
are those letters or numbers
can you spell your name
Diandra he asked you not to touch them
stop draw
stop draw
alright draw stop
stop draw
stop draw
your name is draw
yyy
Diandra don't say stupid
that's not nice to say
he said what
well what does that mean
I didn't hear you say thank_you
yyy
a monster magnet
it does doesn't it
why do you think it sticks
it's the most what
oh it's glue
is that why it's sticking
it's not a magnet after all
it's not
it's not coming out
I don't think it really needs water
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan
no no this probably needs some more ink
pen ink
stamp ink
that's not really ink
that's the water that's mixed in with ink
no I don't think you need water dear
on the pad yes
Adam why don't you let them play with it
come on boys let's go upstairs
I don't want a cat
I've got a dog
I don't want to have a dog
my dog is outside
these are Mexican jumping beans
he can help too
it's right underneath the ink
no I guess not
isn't that nice Adam
very good Adam
can you tie your shoes
look in the bag
I can feel mine jump when I hold mine in my hand
what
yes I see
without what
my arm is too big
let me put it on you
how can you get out
some more
you haven't finished playing with these
are you sure you want something else
alright
what did you find Adam
now Adam you better find yourself a a target
you could use this for a target
it's a dart
aim for the target
dart
somebody what
you missed
I never what
won't get it
be careful
I have an idea what you said
I won't tell you
it's a secret

what're you doing that for
are you his admirer
why don't you take that one out
you only had two
here it is on the chair

shoot at yourself
I wouldn't do that
that could be dangerous
no don't point it toward anyone
why don't you do it over here
hit on the black
almost
two more darts
well no
let's look at your gun
careful Adam
yes
alright
important to who
why don't you stick to one thing
only the one thing yes
that's right
she wants so much toys
what will I play with when I go home
alright
you have_to take care of what
to do what
stand up
what're you supposed to be
well let's let Paul keep one
do you have one Diandra
yes
just like a target shall be
is that what you said
you're aiming some place
a Mexican day
yes he can keep it
that's right
what
what's wrong Paul
why
a what
no what could you put the cans on
a record_phone
you mean the record player
maybe I can help you fasten it
I don't think so
