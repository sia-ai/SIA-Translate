Max that's right
my two closest friends here both had babies two days apart
they were both in women and infants so I went
I went down the hall and saw one went down the hall and saw the other one
two baby boys
and I was so convinced that Max was going to be a girl like I was so convinced that I actually went out and bought a present for a baby girl and then xxx like it's a boy and I'm like rats
back to Nordstrom's
I was so shocked I couldn't believe it
yes what should we read
yeah
I had never seen the movie I didn't realize it was kind of a downer
every morning as the sun peeks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
this is Pride rock
home my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock in honor
to to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
one of the doctors that my grandmother had actually it's like no one could remember his name he's from India and we kept calling him doctor Mufasa
xxx but like that's not his name xxx I mean not to his face but like just us
yes I can yes I can
as part of the celebration I had a special duty I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
and I lifted the future king up high for all to see
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the backside of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
this was Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba you should have been first in line
I was first in line until the little hair ball born and with that Scar stalked out of the cave
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
look Simba everything the light touches is our kingdom
what about that shadowy place said Simba
that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
later as Simba headed back to the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm going to be king of Pride rock my dad showed me the whole kingdom
he didn't show you what's beyond the rise at the northern borders said Scar
well no he said I can't go there
oh he's right only the bravest lions go there said Scar
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on said Simba I just heard about this great place
Simba pounced on Nala and Nala flipped Simba on his back
they tumbled down the hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
we're way beyond the boundary of Pride rock
of the Pride lands said Nala
and we're in danger
suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
a trio of trespassers said the hyenas
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
I'm very disappointed in you Simba you deliberately disobeyed me he said
I was just trying to be brave like you
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble said Mufasa
Dad we're pals right we'll always be together won't we
Simba said Mufasa let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars the great kings of the past look down on us from the stars
so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
meanwhile Scar went to visit the hyenas
I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you and you couldn't even dispose of them
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared for the death of the king
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
your father has a marvelous surprise for you he said
Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeests directly towards Simba
wildebeests
didn't it
didn't we read that they were going to get a wildebeest in the zoo in our zoo
right
that's exciting
Mufasa took off to save his young son
but he plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and pulled him to a nearby ledge
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb
climb another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
but Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell down
it was an accident said Scar I didn't mean for it to happen
what am I going to do said Simba
run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
meanwhile Simba plodded across the savanna without any food or water
and it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot sun
a big hearted wart+hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the young lion and he turned to his trusty pal a meerkat named Timon
he's so cute can't we keep him
are you nuts Pumbaa lions eat guys like us said Teemon Timon
you want some what
you want another sandwich
wow I'm impressed Honey

Simba stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
but eventually he got homesick
and one night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
Simba came to his rescue but after wrestling with the lioness who easily flipped him on his back he realized she was his old friend Nala
why didn't you come back to Pride rock she asked you are the king
I'm not the king Scar is
Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or and no water
and if you don't do something soon everyone will starve
you're our only hope
Simba went to the reflecting pool and when he looked in the water he saw a lion
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
you must take your place in the circle of life
encouraged by his father's words Simba returned to Pride rock
when he arrived he found the land bare and dry
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
I'm the king said Scar if you were half the king Mufasa was I'm ten times the king Mufasa was
suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
I'm a little surprised to see you alive Simba
give me one good reason I shouldn't rip you apart Scar
but Scar forced Simba to say in front of all the lions that he had caused his father's death
oh Simba you're in trouble again but this time daddy isn't here to save you and everyone knows why
