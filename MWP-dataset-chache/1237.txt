and there's some pictures of babies
hello stranger friend I am Tondie a Nibilay girl in south Africa
I'm eight years old and my best friend look at all the necklaces she's wearing
and she has a head necklace around her head too
I'm eight years old and my best friend is a chicken
her name the what the girl
who's who
her name is Tondie
yes she has a head band
isn't that nice
you could wear a head band if you wanned too
and what's she holding there
chicken
you may laugh at that but when I tell my friend secret she can talk all she wants but no one can understand her except another chicken of course my chicken not only listens to my stories she has other uses if you play with her and take her mind off of what's going on you can quickly very quickly snatch a feather or two when she's distracted she doesn't notice and feathers come in handy later of course
I have two hopes one is my name Tondie which means hope in my language
did you know she speaks a different language Naima
Nibilay girls are named hope many Nibilay girls are named hope
the other hope I have is that at the end of this book I can say goodbye friend not goodbye stranger friend
here she's wearing a different necklace
hey look at those painted houses
wow

jumped so jumped comes after dinosaur
the scary dinosaur jumped over and then we need a we need a the over the woman right

it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane
at least it belonged to Lucinda but she never ordered meals
Jane was the cook
but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings
there were two red lobsters and a ham
a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges
they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful
this is describing some toy food
one morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator
which is another name for stroller
there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet
presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise
in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board
Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again
Tom Thumb was a mouse
this is a story about mice
d'you want me to keep reading
a minute afterwards Hunka Munka his wife put out her head too
and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box
the dolls' house stood at the other side of the fireplace
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug
they pushed the front door
it was not fast
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went upstairs and peeped into the dining room
then they squeaked with joy
squeak
such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table
