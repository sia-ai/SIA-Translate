the snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking
crunch crunch crunch
his feet sank into the snow
he walked with his toes pointing out like this

he walked with his toes pointing in like that
he dragged his feet slowly to make tracks
and he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track
what was it Ethan

not yet
so he made a smiling
what's that

he pretended he was a
a mess maker
no a mountain climber
he climbed up a great big heaping mountain of snow and slid whoops
all the way down
he picked up a handful of snow and another and still another
he packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow
then he went into his warm house
he told his mommy all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks
and he thought and thought and thought about it
what's he doing
before he got into bed he looked in his pocket
his pocket was empty
the snowball wasn't there
he felt very sad
while he slept he dreamt that the snow had melted all
sun had melted all the snow away
but when he woke up his dream was gone
the snow was still falling everywhere
new snow was falling
after breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall and they went out together into the deep deep snow
