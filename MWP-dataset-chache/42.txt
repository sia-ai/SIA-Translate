no I don't mind
in other words he doesn't really want us to clean it up
he wants us to leave it big
you never knew there was a zipper on that

Marky said to lock my door and I said
okay I'll lock it
then he said
yeah
yeah our door would crack open when we if we crashed
you're right
it would crack if a car was zooming down
yeah
right that's right Mark
so you should've locked it
but I have locked it Mark
yeah right if a car was coming
that is you should lock it every time a car comes right
note the incorrect use of the past conditional
uh at least discoursewise incorrect
Marky
uh what other things are supposed are people supposed to do so they can stay safe in cars
yeah
I mean you mean kids can't do it
yeah
kids have_to hold hands but they can't go out very farther
what
oh oh they can't go out without their father
is that what he said
I'm sorry it not without very farther without their father
why can't they go out without their father
yeah
that's right
and what other things about staying safe
you should never hit someone right
with a car
you mean never hit someone with a car
right
with what
never hit someone with a strong hand
uhhuh
what
yeah
what
uhhuh
if it's very important
you shouldn't grind your finger and you shouldn't drink too much wine
uhhuh
uhhuh
right you shouldn't ever try to do that right
cause what'll happen if you get the doll

he thought at first he thought the whole day and changed switched around
he didn't really
got_to be
he didn't really
no he was just playing around with it though
well why do you think time flies Ross
you just played a joke
in fact you really got tricked by the sun didn't you
he went behind no by the mountain
the mountain tricked you
you thought he first you thought it was dark and then you turned around and suddenly saw it was light
the mountain got in your way
so you couldn't see the sunset
uhhuh
right
is it night+time now
what is it
night+time or sunset
you know what they call it now Ross
it's not sunset
it's called dusk
dusk
it's now it's dusk
you're right Ross
look

it's dusk
Ross says
and he said
yeah he said
you're going to be very lucky in other words watch out
okay
mhm
right now
do you wanna get dressed and go down with me and get breakfast
okay you sleep some more then
okay
okay
a little earlier Marky said um
and Ross said
and and he said
well actually you said
Mark and then I said Marky means that he you he drempt that you ate it
and
now he's saying now he's he's correcting himself but actually he's saying
in my sleep
you didn't eat it
just in his dream honey
what else did Rossy do
mhm
did he finish it
d'you
did he finish it Mark
how do you know Ross
you weren't in Marky's you didn't get in Marky's head to have his dream
how do you get inside Marky's head
you don't know yet but you just did
that's right
you just don't know Ross
yeah
the real Rossy wasn't in his dream Ross
it was just the dream Ross right
Tiffany's Ross
who's Tiffany's Ross
oh really
does Tiffany have a boyfriend
where's Tiffany
oh yeah
and her boyfriend is called
Ross Alexander
Ross Alexander MacWhinney
Ross Alexander MacWhinney
are you her boyfriend
are you sure you're not her boyfriend
his name is Ross
hm
who
who
mud people
who
better than those dumb hated mud people
were there mud people in your dream
you can't kick mud people
know what Ross
Gargamel
uhhuh
I see
isn't that funny
how many kids wanna eat breakfast with Daddy
mhm
he brought a picture to me and I said
what is that
and he said
and he went back and he wrote mhiabbi
and I said
oh it's uh mhiabbi
and he said
and he said and he wanted a and he took it to Mary and he said look Mom it's a mobby
uh I mean mhiabbi
and what's interesting about this is that he he's a little bit earlier he was saying what's uh s e r b y s and i said it's a serbys and what's uh g o n k u r and this is a gonkur and he kept on spelling random letter combinations and I had to pronounce them
a_lot_of them were unpronounceable
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just ts ts throw letters together and some how and some how they'll make a word
this is very much like uh when he was a little baby he used to sort of make up words even though they didn't really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing
now he is writing them out
Mary says that she used to do that when she was a kid
now I certainly never remember doing any thing like that
she also remembers uh taking pictures to people and asking them what what they were
again I'd never do anything quite like that I mean any where near like that
I can never did anything in fact that I can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all
well let's see we were um www
www
Ross is having some uh orange juice and uh I take took a little sip from glass before uh
I gave it to him and Ross complains said Daddy took some of mine or something like that he said
and I said I'm just testing
and he said you're not testing
I already what'd you say
I already had a glass
and which means that
you knew it was okay because xxx
I already had some and I liked it
I already had some and I liked it yeah
you you'd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point
and I knew it was okay
so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point
it couldn't have changed by now
I asked Ross could you be a little nicer and he said I hate being nice
yeah you're being nice
and then he said I when were you so nice
and he said I had to be that way all the way home yesterday
had to be that way all the way home yesterday
in the car coming home from Washington D_C
mhm
that's true
you were good yesterday
mhm
zzz
well why do I have_to make breakfast and bring you things
why do I have_to be that good mother
when I'd really just like to sit here and stuff my face
just make coffee for me
just make the rolls for me
just serve myself forget you
yeah
yeah
stop doing
I have_to say would you like some tea honey
mhm
and then if you say yes I have_to go out there and make it instead of drinking my coffee
why do I have_to be nice like that huh
Ross come back
oh he's gonna give you a kiss
oh he's gonna
maybe he's come and do something nice
zzz
zzz
he came around and got his own honey instead of asking someone for it
because he knew that if he he would be told that he w he was asking and demanding for too too many things right
Ross use your spoon when you do that okay
mhm
how come you didn't let him pour it
what
you don't want him to pour it
no it's too much
you're gonna lose your spoon
twirl your spoon
twirl it around
good
now go
hey good
Marky what would you like
and then you can lick your spoon
but don't use it again
Marky uh just did a picture and he said I can't wait all day
he came up to me I can't wait all day
what he meant was that he wanted me too uh
I assume that what he wanted what it was me to put a name on it and have me date it so it was
or look at it
look at it or something yeah
pay some attention to it
and um so I put a name on it date it and uh and he I said okay go put it over on Ross's desk and he said I'll put it in pile
in other words he didn't say the pile I put it in put it in a pile
drop drop the a
