Scuffy was sad
Scuffy was grumpy
Scuffy sniffed his blue smokestack
the toystore is no place for a red painted tugboat said Scuffy
he sniffed his blue smokestack again
I was meant for bigger things
he's in a toystore
perhaps you would not be grumpy if you went sailing said the man with the polka+dot tie
there he is
who owned the toystore
so one night he took Scuffy home to his little boy
he filled the bathtub with water
sail little tugboat said the little boy
I won't sail in a bathtub said Scuffy
a tub is no place for a red painted tugboat
I was meant for bigger things
the next day the man with the polka+dot tie and his little boy carried Scuffy to a river
sail little tugboat said the man with the polka+dot tie
and what did he do Ethan
it was full of water
and Scuffy moved along quickly down the stream down the river
come back little tugboat come back
cried the little boy
not I tooted Scuffy not I
this is the life for me
he keeps going
all that day Scuffy sailed along with the stream
past cows and women washing clothes
Scuffy almost got hit by a cow
that was not fun
night came and the moon came out
there was nothing to see but the quiet trees
suddenly an owl called out
hoot hoot
toot toot
cried the little tugboat
he was scared
he wanted to see the man with the polka+dot tie
the next morning Scuffy moved on
he saw two streams
to make a big river
Scuffy sailed down the river
he sailed past villages
he sailed past men with logs
what're they doing Ethan
they're gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck
this is a fine river said Scuffy but it's very busy and big for me
he sailed under some bridges
the river got deeper and wider and now there were big cities
and big boats
the river got deeper and deeper and deeper and it moved faster and faster
then it started to rain and Scuffy was riding on the waves
up and down
lots and lots and lots_of rain
people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river
because the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and higher and higher and higher
and there's Scuffy all alone
on went the river to the sea
at last Scuffy sailed into a big city
here the river got wider and there were docks and wharves and big ships
it was a big noisy place
and cranes loaded freight onto some ships
Scuffy said toot toot
but nobody saw him the little tugboat
oh no said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean
there's no beginning and no end to the sea
I wish I could find the man with the polka+dot tie and xxx
yup there's a red truck and what's that
yep it goes all the way to the dock
just then just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land a hand reached out
mm there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships isn't there
that's Scuffy again
he's all by himself
but look who picked him up
who picked him up
the man with the polka+dot tie and the little boy
and he said I wanna go home to the bathtub
that's just the right size for me
the end
