well what kind of animals did you see at the zoo
with James you saw the lions sleeping and how about with daddy when you went

well lets see if you can tell Ericka the one other thing you did at Dr Weist's house that was fun you went swimming we ate hotdogs and then did we go for a walk
yeah and then what happened to you when you went for a walk
you crashed that's true what part did you get hurt on
which part
your toe well how did you hurt your toe

I remember that part
where's your bandaid now
that is her keys and stuff
oh yeah that is her stuff
you wanna throw that up in the air
huh oh my look at this

those are all kinds of movies you can get yeah
that's a nice little book but you know what that's an old book you actually can't buy that stuff anymore
because it's an old little catalog they don't have it anymore honey
yeah we do not like the shooting guys right
why
do we do shooting in our house
no we do not
what happens if you do shooting at your house Ericka does not know what happens
somebody could die that's true but we do not do shooting because that will be hurting people and if you shoot then you have_to go and go and sit by yourself right
but you do not do that too much
you take those parts off
you don't really need those parts okay
we do not like shooting guys because they hurt people Boo
who sings that
Darth Vader
how about who's this guy Ericka does not even know who that is either
you shot the monkey
where do you stick that monkey
you could stand on the bear cave because you could reach but you cannot
want me to stick it on there
you got another idea
here oh my gosh
what do you think about that monkey
he's silly
he is funny where'd you get that monkey anyway
at your daddy Jason's work
you want me to get down
how about if I get down then would I tickle you
