you need to put it on inside
look look this is where her arm goes
there
you know what
can I show you
this is where her arms are gonna go inside these holes
they're not gonna go in this way that would be putting it on backwards
her arms have_to go in these holes
one at a time is a good way to do it
yup
I see her other arm
there
now she's got a night+gown on
is she gonna velcro up the back
it's that green one right there isn't it
and I think you put the is the mattress and the blanket over here

hi um I have a Eureka Mighty_Might that needs a little repairing
um it's actually just the part that attaches I don't know even what you call it
attaches into the main body of the vacuum
yeah the place where the hose attaches there's a tiny tiny piece of plastic that's broken off
but it may need the whole hose may therefore need replacing
do you carry all those parts or
yeah
right
that's right except that it's been a really good machine so
yeah
yeah
how long does it take to order parts usually for those
mm
that's awhile okay well um if I can I will try and bring it in later
what are your hours normally
thank you very much okay byebye
mm
phooey said Mommy
you okay
oh to pretend that they are
yeah
is that gonna be Pikes with Parents
do you need some help
oh
do you want some help sweetie
no
oh dear
there seems to be a lot of unhappiness in this house
is there something you'd like to do
that would be more fun
oh
that's the swimsuit it's it is very hard
can I hold her while you put it on
would that help
you know yeah
that's not how it goes you're right
let's look at this if you were putting on your swim+suit would you put your feet in first
is that how we put your swimsuit on you
okay if you hold it
I'll put her feet in
there's one foot
hey is she gonna wear these black shoes into the pool
they don't come off I know
yeah
so now she's got it on her bottom
now she just needs to get out her arms
I will hold it and what you wanna do is stretch it way out until it gets unto her shoulder like that
now her other one stretch that sleeve way out there yup
it's very stretchy fabric
oh it's like the yarn sweater
now you can velcro it up
hey
okay on this there's only been about five or ten minutes
interval between the last tape and this one
on the twenty second of January
hm
that's my name
yes
what about the doll's stuffed animals
the daddy's gonna go to work now
oh he's gonna work down in the basement
that kind of office
the home office the office at home
okay
is it we could make that could be the basement down there
oh
hm
okay we could try to do that
uhhuh
and that's where the office will be
oh
okay
well we could put the base plate there
and then we could build the desk and xxx put the computer and what else is down there
in the basement
xxx yes
yeah he has a lotta messed up papers down there that's true
okay
well we could use regular chairs for his desk chair
and we could make this this could be his desk
we could put two of these together to make his desk
like that
that's about the size of his desk and we could put a chair there
here's here's a xxx here's a green chair
you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it
what do you think
what else is in his office
the base plate
but while we're building it we can keep it right here if we want to
kay
what else does he have down here
the treadmill
okay
this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way
not really
that's true it doesn't have a hold in it
hm
the treadmill also has like two handles
doesn't it
kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto I thought I would make that part
wait wait wait wait wait wait
because I thought you know like he when he walks on the treadmill
he holds on
right
yeah
and then there's a bar across them
let's get one more yellow small yellow lego
to go here
and then something goes across that he
I don't really
huh
something is wrong with this lego
so it can kinda doesn't this kinda look like the treadmill
well that's I think it looks kinda like the treadmill
then he has uh he has a sofa right here doesn't he
next to his desk
a pink one
do you need to use the potty
okay
let's go look
the one that's a pull+out sofa that great+grandma slept on when she was with us
it pulls out
and turns into a bed
yeah you know which one I mean
should we make that
you're right
could we use red instead maybe
you're right there are no pink legos
there does that kinda look like that's a sofa
that's part of the sofa
I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa
I'm just pretending
this is the part to lean against that's what I was thinking
and you sit like this
if the doll was there she'd be she'd sit like this
on the sofa
this is a nonfunctioning Lego
yup push
yeah push
yeah yup
watch Mommy do it
pushing
you can use your regular voice if you want help with something sweetie
Bibby would sit like that
is that Bibby
Bibby
Bibby and Bobby
mhm
would you are you interested in sitting on your bed and reading a book and having some quiet time
it might be nice
because it's kind of nap time for you
oh build a guest bedroom okay
here's a bed
how about right over here
guests sleep over here
in the guest bedroom
there's the bed
yup
there's a little table in our guest bedroom isn't there
like this table was on this side
this side
the table that holds magazines and things
and I think maybe there's even
is there a little table on this side too
yeah
alright
okay
did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you're ready
to paint with the water colors
yeah there might be just one I don't remember
if there's two or one
it's still snowing out look
you can see some snow falling still
because the lights aren't on
and it's a dark day it's not a sunny day
alright here we are
oh there are two tables see
one on that side
and one on that side
and there are two lamps too
you could do that
and there's the chair in the guest bedroom also
okay
yeah
alright
is your neck itchy
why don't you walk up the stairs
oopsie
because it's got a zipper
here hold still for a second
okay leave that there
please
you wanna unzip it all the way
okay I'll move the microphone then
okay just a second
alright
alright
you don't have_to inhale it
let's go upstairs
inhale means to breathe
you looked like you were breathing in the microphone
I don't know
oh that's what you were doing
yes oh you're in luck
Naima I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing I'll be right back
just to the washing machine
hi
hey where's your microphone
oh brother
oh Naima
alright where is it honey
on the floor okay
okay
you wanna do the painting now
because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another
because that way the colors you won't get all xxx all mixed up on the brush
which is what sometimes happens
well there's actually some water right there
and there's also some on top so there's some in there
yeah ooh
yeah of course not you can take as long as you want
thank you sweetie
you can let me know if you decide you want another color
okay
which color would you like next
um purple green blue orange red
brown
you want brown okay
I'll get you brown
and then after you're done with brown you can pick out another color
there's red
he says wed with a w
yeah
Wodney_Wat
some toddlers can't
well because even when you're a little kid you're still learning how to talk aren't ya
it's not so easy
to learn how to talk
it's a very difficult thing
yup that's another way you can do it alright
oh what color would you like next
er wed or red
red
okay
let me have that brush
and I will get you the red now
do you like that Wodney_Wat story
yeah
why does the title of the book say Wodney_Wat instead of Rodney_Rat
the title of the book uses
the way Wodney says his name
because it's about him it doesn't use
what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat right
well they aren't toddlers they probably can pronounce their r
properly
well grown+ups usually can pronounce things
it's just that when you're little and growing up some things are hard to pronounce
it's hard to twist your mouth in that just the right way
don't you think
do you think it's hard to say some words
what words do you think it's hard to say
there's water right in there
yup the paint gets into the water and colors the water red
he does
he can't
what's in my nose or anyone's nose
hm
there's little hairs in most people's noses
the hairs keep all the dirt out
and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat
well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat
because your nose is actually connected to your throat
okay
oh
with a tail
oh
oh my
a blue ear above
blue air above oh like sky you mean
here's some black
yeah I gave you a different brush because the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper
on your painting
what things are black
well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming
it's usually a very very dark grey not actually black
but at night sometimes the sky can look black
when it's nighttime
okay
the animal eats the black thing
oh
that's alright
I'll clean it up
when you're done with the painting
oh
oh the black stuff is stuff inside the animal's nose
oh
which pink part
oh
that's where its nose is
huh
uhhuh
okay
oh
hm
oh so the sky has dark parts and blue parts
wow look at all the snow in the sky right now
my_goodness
it's really snowin
you want some blue now
okay
should I take that
mhm
that's part of the sky
yeah
it's getting to be dark yeah
um I think the you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple but you've had the other colors
yeah okay hold on
what do you think sometimes is
yeah
funny shaped grapes
that are not good to eat
oh that are good to eat
sometimes the sky can be purple what other things are purple
the sky can be purplish if there's a nice sunset
and some flowers are purple
let's see
let me get you the purple
are you all done with the blue
do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue
okay
do you want me to get the purple for you
when you're done with that
yup you can call them pictures or paintings
yup
well they're pictures
you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting
because painting means what you're doing but it also means what it is you painted
yeah I think that's probably what we say in this house we say you're painting a painting
or your painting a picture
I guess maybe we say both
here is the purple
sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset
and it's more that it's purplish it's not usually bright purple
mhm
oh boy
are you done with the purple
you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange
I'll give you a separate I'll give you a different
brush for the orange so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together
so I'll put the orange all the way over here let me get some water for that
let's see
okay
now I'll actually move this down here since you're mostly done with the purple
now you can use the brush for the orange
oh sun
yes sometimes it is
well
usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange
I think green is the only one you haven't had
okay
don't paint on the table please
you can use this brush for the green
can you think of anything
no
when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside
ah yes
grass
yes
would you like another piece of paper
you mean you're done painting that one
okay
wow
oh alright
do you need a little water next to the green
looks like it
here
oops a little too much
that's for me
yay
I'm gonna come look at it
do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it
would you like another piece of paper
hm
mm
yeah it needs sometime to dry
lemme get you some paper
I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time
okay
so now you have three colors
you have orange green and purple all together there
well so that you don't mix the colors up
if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green
the colors will mix up and probably become some version of brown
sometimes you wanna do that but you may not wanna do that all the time
so this way you can use more than one brush
one for each color if you want to
uhhuh
ah
and what color are you finding that you make when you do that
what would you call the combination color
I was peeling carrots and slicing them
woo_peeling them
no I was actually peeling them
hm
making some lines
hm
hm
well when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors
it's seems like I do get a picture almost every day you've given me one
it's very nice to have them
really
he's at work
you know those brushes really are shedding their their brush their
these aren't very good brushes
because they're just coming out
the uh bristles these are called the bristles
the bristles just are coming right out
are you done with this one do you want me to put it aside
do you want any writing on it
mm okay
you wanna write with a different with a pen or a crayon or something
you can write letters with paint
do you wanna try that
you can
is that what you wanna do
yeah

Daddy
mothers call their children babies even if they're not really babies anymore
it's kind of you know it's kind of just an expression you know that means
an expression is something that's not exactly true
but in this case it means
it's kind of like saying I love you I remember when you were a baby
you're my baby because you're my baby from the day you were born
or you're my baby ever since you were teenie and tiny
and I took care of you and did everything for you I remember doing that
when a mommy or a daddy calls a toddler or a bigger kid a baby even my mother sometimes says you know you're still my baby
oh it's just a way of saying
so when Mommy or Daddy calls you baby it's just another way of saying hey I love you
what do you think of that
I know Daddy is going to really like that picture a lot
yeah
you're done with all your painting
okay

the battery situation is that I put new batteries in the transmitters

orange is the only color you haven't used yet
so that the colors don't get all mixed up

whatever you wanna is fine on the paper

rows of boys

alright
yeah hold on

oh your microphone came off
can you stand still for a sec
was what on it
oh what a great time to have a phone
no leave it on
let me get the phone
hello
hi xxx
hi xxx
did you call me
I did a little while back
okay
I was on the phone
yeah I figured actually xxx
after a while I realized
um uh I had email from xxx that she can't come this week
the first Wednesday of every month is another play+group
uh they go to a Korean play+group cause her son's adopted from Korea
so she's gonna do that this week so you still haven't met her
right
but if if you're doing craft it means there's only xxx Naima and xxx and I put in a call to xxx but um she wasn't home when I called her so I assume she's coming
um what about xxx
um they are still um
she's still on vacation
is she
yeah she was gonna miss two weeks
oh okay
yeah she's coming back uh this Saturday
oh okay
and I still have_to figure out if I'm here next week or not but anyway so it's just three of us tomorrow
alright well I'm not sure what we're doing yet
I'm waiting for xxx to get home to decide
so we might just be doing something simple
oh I don't care
yeah I mean
maybe just coloring or something
yeah you know I mean and I've got tons of stuff here too
so if you wanna just organize it with the stuff I've got that's also fine
well I have plenty of stuff and I'm glad to bring it
um it's just a matter of you know just like how much time I have to get it ready tonight
you know there's really
since it's only three of us and it's gonna be short
we have_to leave at eleven anyway so
yeah mm okay
you know if it doesn't happen I'll just get out paper and crayons and or you can get paper and crayons out
or markers xxx
I just bought one of those huge rolls of brown paper at Home_Depot today that is great
we could just spread it out and
oh that would be fun
we could even trace bodies or something like that
okay
so there's lots_of very simple things
I wouldn't
yeah I know I'm not gonna go all out
I thought it would be fun to make valentines but I think about doing it next week but we might not even
oh
right
so let me bring that stuff cause I have it to make
oh that's great
xxx paper
but I've been wanting to do it with her and I just haven't done it yet so that's a good idea
well xxx
so maybe we'll do that if we're not gonna meet next week maybe still
well you know even if I'm not here you all can still meet
if I'm not
if I'm out of town you all can figure out if you wanna meet at xxx house or
did you just go again
okay
yeah well we'll see
but we don't wanna miss making valentines so maybe I'll just bring that stuff
okay
good
alrightie
I'll see you tomorrow
alright
bye
bye
I'm gonna put this to dry over here
he never goes in this bathroom
well he does once in a while but I think he's kind_of forgotten that it's here
so it's a good place to hide things from him
you think he might hide there
I have_to go back to the stove because I actually have something on the stove
yeah I
let me stir
I'm going to
I have_to stir what's on the stove first so it doesn't burn
I don't want burning onions do I
you know you can you can bury me up to my neck in the sand
xxx go do
you're a shining star when you smile you're a shining star you can shine for me
