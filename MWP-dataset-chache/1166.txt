Horton hatches the egg
sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg
I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my
from sitting just sitting here day after day
it's work how I hate it I'd much rather
I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
then Horton the elephant passed by her
hello called the lazy bird smiling her best
you've nothing to do and I do need a
would you like sit on the egg in my nest
the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't
me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small maam and I'm so
big
huge
gigantic
your egg is so small maam and I'm so
immense
tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it
Sweetie can you help Mommy
please
please
Honey
you're gonna help yourself okay
very nice Honey
xxx sure Honey
all different colors
another colorful springtime day
hooray
want me to read a little more
just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind
come be a good fellow I know you won't mind
I can't said the elephant please begged the bird I won't be gone long sir I give you my word
I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
very well said the elephant since you
insist
you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to break it
I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say
toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered away
hm
first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
first thing to do is to prop up this tree
and make it much stronger that has to be done
before I get on it I must weigh a
right
he weighs a
he must weight a ton
and that's a lot
then carefully tenderly gently he crept
up the trunk to the nest where the little egg
slept
and Horton the elephant smiled now that's that
and he sat and he sat and he sat and he
and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a terrible storm
it poured and it lightninged it thundered and rumbled
this isn't much fun the poor elephant grumbled
I wish she'd come back because I'm cold and I'm wet
I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
right
but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach
enjoying the sunshine way off in
right
and having such fun such a wonderful rest
decided she'd never go back to her
right that's not very nice is it
no that's why she's a lazy lazy bird
so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
and then came the winter the snow and sleet
and icicles hung from his trunk and his
ah
you're right
but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze
I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
right
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
one hundred percent
right
he's very faithful and he's taking care of that egg
right
make sure it's okay
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through
and then came the spring time with troubles anew
his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
look Horton the elephant's up in a tree
they taunted and teased and they yelled how absurd
old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
right
they laughed and they laughed then they all ran away
and Horton was lonely he wanted to play
he did wanna play
well I think they're going to go play but Horton's got_to take care of his little egg right
great
he's got responsibilities
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
no matter what happens this egg must be tended
but poor Horton's troubles were far far from ended
for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind
three hunters came sneaking up softly behind
he heard the men's steps and turned with a start
three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
did he run
he did not
he stayed on that nest
he held his head high and threw out his chest
he looked at the hunters as much as to say
shoot if you must but I won't
right
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
right
hm
mhm
that's right
sat all that day
but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with wide eyes
look they all shouted can such a thing be
an elephant sitting on top of a tree
it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new
don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just what we'll do
let's take him alive why he's terrible funny
we'll sell him back home to a circus
right
no that wasn't very nice
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on
no they're not so nice
they dug up his tree and put it inside with Horton so sad xxx
no those hunters are not so nice
well this little animal's nice
right and Horton's nice
yeah
but Horton so sad he practically
right
no
we're off the men shouted and off they all went with Horton unhappy
one hundred percent
oh no
up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet high
and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
right
then out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
what a trip
no he doesn't feel so well
rolling and tossing and splash with a spray
no
and Horton said day after day after day I meant what I said and I said what I meant but oh am I
oh poor Horton
after bobbing around for two weeks like a cork they landed at last in the town of
New_York who lives in New_York
that's one of the hunters
um one of them's right here
he's probably still on the boat
I think
who lives in New_York Honey
exactly
all ashore the men shouted and down with a lurch
when elephant
Horton the elephant still on his perch
tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him
bop
Horton landed and then
then sold him
sold to a circus then week after week they showed him to people at ten cents a peek
they took him to
Boston
xxx Daddy works in Boston doesn't he
yeah how does he get from Boston
whoa careful oh my gosh careful Sweetie
watch out for your granola bites
got a little smushed
they took him to Boston to Kalamazoo Chicago Weehawken and Washington too
to Dayton Ohio
careful Sweets oh my gosh
to Dayton Ohio Saint_Paul Minnesota Wichita Kansas and Drake
north Dakota
and everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see and laugh at the elephant up in a tree
poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went
but he said as he sat in that hot noisy tent
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent
then one day
the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not so far from
right
is that nice
sure
and dawdling a long way up high in the sky who of all people should chance to fly by but that old good for nothing bird runaway Maisy
still on vacation and still just as
right
no Maisy is not very nice
and spying the flags on the tents just below she
I hope she's gonna be nice again
she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door good gracious gasped Maisy I've seen you before
poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
he started to speak but before he could talk
there rang out the noisiest ear+splitting squeaks from the egg that he'd sat on for fifty one weeks
a thumping a bumping a xxx scratching my egg shouted Horton my egg why it's hatching
but it's mine screamed the bird when she heard the egg crack
the work was all done now she wanted it back
it's my egg she sputtered you stole it from me get off of my nest and get out of my tree
not a nice bird
now
poor Horton backed down with a sad heavy heart
but at that very instant the egg burst apart
and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg that he'd sat on so long and so well
Horton the elephant saw something whiz
it had ears and a tail and a trunk
just like
and the people came shouting what's all this about and they looked and they stared with their eyes popping out
and they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more
they'd never seen anything like it before
my_goodness my gracious they shouted my word
it's something quite new it's an
an elephant bird
no she's not so nice that Maisy
and it should be it should be it should be like that because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat he meant what he said and he said what he meant and they sent him home
happy
one hundred percent

mushroom hunt
early fall is the best time to go I didn't know this Honey
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms
we should tell Daddy that
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal uh other plants or animal dung and feed on them
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs
here are some to look for

planting
mhm
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have_to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand
you can plant them in a garden or in pots
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside
