oh thank you very much Honey
thank you
next to the tv where it belongs
phew that was hard work
phew
meh
meh whatever
meh
xxx xxx
xxx okay Franklin rides a bike
xxx Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
but Franklin had a problem
what was Franklin's problem
right
he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels right
right
in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one
she took her extra wheels off first
she practiced and practiced and then went to the park to show off
look at me she said I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
who's that
Rabbit and who's that
Bear
right
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
Franklin was worried that his friends would make fun of his training wheels
so he lied and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
aw
poor Franklin
what's Franklin doing in this picture
what's he doing here
what's he doing there
xxx Sweetie
is he on the slide
he's on the swing you're right
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell into the flower bed
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
aw
poor Franklin
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
what are they doing
xxx they're getting ice cream cones
what kind of ice cream are they eating
you don't know
whaddya think
what's your favorite kind of ice cream
really
do you like vanilla
you like chocolate ice cream
mm
in an ice cream cone that sounds great
you like strawberry too
mm what color is strawberry ice cream
orange I think strawberry ice cream is pink
see
see I think maybe that's strawberry
that's strawberry right
yeah I don't have any though
I'm sorry to say
maybe we can go later to get ice cream whaddya think
okay
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
aw Franklin's pretty sad
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin
hm let's see
it looks like some little schmutz maybe from your granola bar
xxx maybe it's your sticky granola bar
well
your granola bar has a raspberry center so maybe that's what it was
what Sweetie

I love you
I love your kisses
xxx I see you little blankie girl

xxx there you are
are you hiding
yes
yes I can
well said Franklin maybe I can try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he said
his mother held on to the seat
try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
he felt unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bike is difficult said his mother
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin
it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easy for them she asked
Franklin had to think about that
xxx that's a little mouse what's he doing
oh you're right he is riding his bicycle
Franklin went to the park
he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
easy for you said Beaver she tried once more and fell again
maybe tomorrow she grumbled
Franklin remembered when Badger learned to swim
she was afraid to put her head underwater
it's easy said Franklin just do it
Badger sputtered and cried
it took her a long time to feel good in the water
now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
where is Snail
I don't think Snail is in this book
Snail's in the other book
Snail's at the museum right
in the other book
xxx Mommy's gonna hafta get a hard candy because I can't stop coughing
maybe that would help me stop coughing whaddya think
let's look over
here
you wanna pretend to eat one
let's see
pretend to eat one
Mommy's gonna have one of these
yeah
but Honey you can't really eat it because it's dangerous for a little girl to eat hard candy
right
maybe you'd like something else to eat
can you pretend with the wrapper on then
it's gonna make your hand all sticky
really
no
no
hello

hm

hm

hm don't eat it
good pretending
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
he couldn't hit the ball at all
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
who's that
Porcupine
just then Porcupine came by
she moved very slowly
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
that's it cried Franklin and hurried home
oh I think Porcupine's nice now
don't you think Porcupine's nice
the bear
why xxx think the bear's mean
uhuh
no the bear's Franklin's friend
they're all nice animals
mhm

oh Beaver sorry that's Beaver
Beaver

he's in the sandbox wow neat
that's great
xxx that's good pretending
Franklin put on padding
he lined the walk with old pillows
I'm ready to try again Franklin told his mother
now I won't worry if I fall
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and fell many times but he never gave up
then it happened
Franklin told his mother to let go
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
way to go cheered his mother
careful Honey
Franklin was thrilled
finally he was riding his bike all by himself
I can do it he shouted and rode to the park to show his friends
look at me he called
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over
I think I'll work on that he laughed
not everything is as easy at it looks

Hilda's having such a good time she doesn't notice it's gotten dark
I wonder where this door leads she says and she enters an empty recording studio
