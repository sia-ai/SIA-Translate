I still don't understand what it means
I'll see when it happens
birthday means that's the day you got born

Danny said to himself what shall I give my mother for her birthday
okay
so Danny started out to see what he could find
he walked along and he met a cat

a turtle doesn't say anything that I know of
I never heard a rabbit make a noise either
an elephant makes a noise but I can't make it
it's a kind of trumpeting noise
see how the goose was gonna give a pillow and Danny didn't need one
so Danny and the hen and the goose
feathers for a pillow
all hopped along until they met an elephant
honk
honk said the goose

I'd like a hug and kiss too
oh

I didn't do it deliberately
okay
I did it by accident
this is a funny way to read a story isn't it
with everything wrong
what is that
a lamb

a sheep
a lamb is a baby sheep
that's right
well
that's a goat
a baby goat's called a kid
a kid
what are you called

you're called a kid
well
how come you and a goat are both called a kid
good morning Mrs_rhinoceros said Danny

I thought it was a rhinoceros
I must be all mixed up
what's a rhinoceros

right
can you give me something for my mother's birthday
baaa said the sheep
I can give you some wool to make a warm blanket for your mother's birthday
are you tired of this story
okay
let's read another story
you do or you don't
you are too big for this
you know when you used to like this book
when you were two
you used to love this book
you carried it everywhere with you
yes
how old are you now
that's a long time ago
okay
you save it for when you have
okay
and we'll save it for when you have a child
and maybe your child will like to see the book that you used to love to read
uhuh
that will be a long
yeah
it is
well
let's xxx it xxx
what does that say in the corner
you know what that says
Laura xxx
let's take this up and I'll put it in the outgrown drawer and save it for you
that's a good idea
Cheeky loves music
yes
that is one of your oldest books
when you were about a year old
and at first you didn't
yes
the binding that's called
the back of the book
right there
feel
it's called the binding
it holds it together
and you know what
you I read that to you every night
you wouldn't go to sleep till I read you that story
isn't that funny
that's what you did for your special time
every night
no
every day
but the nights I did this
you wanna chair or you wanna hear the story
okay
should I turn the tape+recorder off while I read this story
ding+dong
ding+dong rang the bells in the church steeple
Cheeky sat up in bed
ding+dong
ding+dong she answered
her ding+dongs sounded a bit squeaky but Cheeky didn't mind
she loved to sing
do you know what a church steeple is
what is it
you have a carnival where when people die
that what a church steeple is
no
the church steeple thing is the top of the church
that big long tall part
oh
that's a funeral
yes
you go to church to say goodbye when somebody dies
but that's not really a carnival
yes
Nana goes to church every week
no
some people go to church not to say goodbye
some people just go to church
it's their way of talking with God
but we don't do that
Pokky does
Amina does
and xxx
I don't know because I've never seen God
yes
he is invisible
I don't know what he sounds like when he talks xxx because I haven't met God
would you like to go and visit inside a church sometime
just look around
right
alright
it's nothing to be scared of
alright
very big room Laura
with places to sit
rows of seats to sit on so that people can listen to people talk
and it's not xxx
look inside of the church and in some churches and synagogues there are beautiful stained glass windows
there's a part inside of a church
there is God in the church
well
God is inside of the people who think about him when they go to church
the church is a special place for them to go and think about
well
there are some people who believe that
yes
it's very confusing about God
I don't understand very well about God myself
about God
yeah
I I have trouble explaining it to you Laura
because I don't know the answer
I don't think Daddy knows the answer about God either
maybe
what what would you like to know and maybe I can help you
who
Gwww
oh
what
people meet together to talk and to sing and to celebrate thinking about God but they can't really see him
he's not something that we can see
he's something that we can talk about and think about but he's not something that we can put our hands on and touch and see
well
I have never heard him talk
maybe
that's possible that he's an invisible person
that's true
maybe he could what
yes
but invisible things can move around
that's right
that's right
maybe he's right here in this room and we can't see him or hear him or smell him or hear him
well
yeah
I'm not invisible am I
and I could love you too
I xxx
maybe we'd better
well
we can talk about it
I don't mind talking about it
you don't wanna or you do wanna
oh
well
we're not gonna listen to this
her ding+dongs sounded a bit squeaky but Cheeky didn't mind
she loved to sing
just then a little bird flew down onto the window+sill
tweet
tweet he sang
he was xxx for the crumbs she had left on her sill
tweet
tweet
Cheeky blew her whistle
the little bird didn't wait to hear her song
he flew away but Cheeky didn't mind
while she combed her hair she remembered another way to make music
xxx you xxx
by a comb
that's right
she put a piece of paper over her comb then she hummed through it's teeth
she loved the tingling music even though it made her shiver
downstairs the tea+kettle was whistling
Cheeky whistled too
her whistle was as loud as a dozen tea+kettles
at breakfast Cheeky used her spoon to tap a tune on her milk glass
on her plate
on the sugar+bowl and on the coffee+pot
each time she made a different up and down musical sound
please Kiki
not so much noise at the breakfast table said Daddy
Kiki stopped
she couldn't understand why Daddy didn't like her music
why doesn't her Dad like that xxx
huh
too loud
yeah
after breakfast she decided to have a concert with Muffy her cat but Muffy doesn't care about music either
why doesn't Muffy like that music
I don't either
it must not be very good music
he ran away when Kiki tried to blow her horn and beat her drum at the same time
after her nap Kiki still wanted music
she and her playmates were having a fine concert
boom
boom
screech
screech
toot
toot
it sounded wonderful to Kiki
even the xxx sang
but when Daddy came home to put his hands over his ears
excuse me
but when Daddy came home he put his hands over his ears
what a noise he cried
it's time Kiki learns the difference between music and noise
she is big enough to learn to play real music
so the next day Daddy and Kiki went to the music store
first the man in the store showed Kiki the small violin
squeak went the bow across the string
not this one said Kiki
next she tried a cello
it was too tall
you make a cello noise
you know the cello
the tuba was too big and too hard to blow
that's the tuba
right
the harp was beautiful but it looked big too
no
you're not bigger than a harp is
a harp is even bigger than I am
it's a very large instrument
perhaps
that's the one you're gonna choose is the harp
well
I don't know
we'll have trouble finding you a teacher to help you learn how to play the harp Laura
that's a very unusual instrument
maybe they do have a good child harp
I don't know
then the then the music man store
excuse me
then the music store man played pop goes the weasel on the piano
that's right
that's what it says
so she didn't think a piano was a bit too big
piano was what she wanted most of all
then they picked out a piano that was just the right size for Kiki
on the way home Kiki and Daddy did the hurdy+gurdy dance
oh Daddy
that would be fun to play too Kiki said
a piano will be enough said Daddy
Kiki's piano came in a big truck
she could hardly wait xxx to unpack it
she wanted to play so she banged on the keys
she tried sitting on the stool
she tried standing up to reach the pedals but no tune came out
just noise
the next day Miss_Dingle came to teach Kiki how to play the piano
she showed her where to put her fingers on the keyboard and how to play notes
Kiki thought it was hard to use all her fingers
she wanted to use just one finger and play pop goes the weasel
finally Mother said Kiki let's have a surprise
if you will try to use all your fingers I will try to teach you a song for a very special day that is coming soon
Kiki loved the idea of a surprise
happy birthday dear Daddy

that's one of the hard things about a pet
you get to love it and

I didn't wanna tell you this morning
thought it would be hard to go to school
thought you'd wanna be next to Mummy and have a hug
okay
no
we love them all their life and then they die and we miss them
sorry Jwww
there are all different ways of showing sadness
and people show it by trying hard not to cry
other people cry hard
there are all different ways of expressing sadness
doesn't feel like anything
I don't think feels anything when xxx
the body part of doesn't feel anything anymore
doesn't hurt
it's not hungry
doesn't breath
it doesn't speak
yeah
would you like xxx
would be a lot of talking
okay
two gentle girls
too many stories
you know the worst thing of all would be to not feel sad
because if you love somebody and we lose them and you don't feel sad that would be terrible
if some thing that we loved died and we don't feel sadness that would be bad
because we need to let that sadness come out of us
but being alive means there's sad and unhappy things
well
had many happy times
