if it's really stuck in there you can use a screw+driver
well if you can do if you can do it with your hands why use a screw+driver

now that's when you use a screw+driver
see how hard it is to work with your fingers

you put this in here
now turn it
whoops
yeah ah you did it
yeah
that's right
you have one more to go

I think you wanna take this wheel off too
I don't know
screw+driver
then you can take the bumpers off and you can take the seats out
the whole business
there you go

look at that
that is a wrench
see xxx
oh you know what that is
I think that's the jack
the jack is for
you put that under the car when it's got a flat tire like now and it holds the car
put that under the car

you won't help me at all
oh Charlie
uh oh
something's wrong in here Charlie
what am I doing wrong
oh I see
ahhah maybe I can tighten it up with a screw+driver can I do that
ah
but now the wheels don't turn
you know the trouble with this car Charlie
if you tighten up the wheels they don't turn
cause it gets too tight
they don't have any bearings
that's the problem with that
what do you think these two people are thinking about here
who's driving in there
why is that person driving
because he's me
who's this person
is that Mom
where's Charlie
in there
whoop
he is in there
but you know what
he can't see out very well
because there's no window there should we open it up and let him see
who's in there with Charlie
is that Charlie right there
like a Charlie person
okay who else would we put in there with Charlie
do you wanna have someone in there with you
Sabina okay
that's
Sabina will like that
where's a place for Sabina
well we'll just put Sabina right here
okay
Sabina and Charlie together
and we'll close it right up again
oh open it up
oh I see
it's gonna make it hard to drive that way because now now Daddy can't see where he's going
but that's alright
who cares right
now where now where where are we gonna go in this car
oh how can he drive without the wheel
do you wanna try and put that back in for me
huh
you need to screw it on
well here's a screw+driver
why don't you use it
here's a screw
you don't want to
I don't want to either
so one of us is going to have_to do it
I'll put it right here
let me see
I think we'll save that one for later okay
where is this car going Charlie
where should we go in this car
if we were gonna take a ride with you and Sabina and Mom and me where would we go
to the grocery store
okay
then here we are at the grocery store vroom
and we can put all our grocerys in here we'll back it up
and I say
hi Mr Groceryman
can you give me some grocerys in my trunk
I'd like
other people want some grocerys
you mean they're in line ahead of me
oh I see
when is it my turn
huh
that turn
oh that's a zero
oh that's my turn
each of these is a turn
I see
so you have a two turn and a ten turn
that's a hard number I bet you don't know that one
five and zero
when you see five and zero together it's a fifty
two
what's that one
what's this one here
whoops
how about that one right there
zero
you're not playing huh
the the
what other house oh I think you've done this before
ah this is a book
wanna read it
haha
what is this about
The_great_cat_chase well
once upon a time
there was
uh what is that
a lady with a cat
she looks like a
those clothes look too big for that lady
I think maybe she borrows her mommy's clothes
what do you think
yeah
is that a possibility
uh oh what's happening here
can you tell what happened
the cat's running out and hiding
that mischievous cat
and she's picking a flower
and I think she's all excited and alarmed right here
oh where's my cat she says
and who's this over here
he's hiding he's a mischievous cat
and here we have
what is she saying now to that person
huh
what who is that do you think
a policeman
and what do you think she's saying to the policeman
where's my cat
help help where's my cat
who's this guy
he's a boy
but he's wearing
what kind of boots
cowboy boots on his tricycle
all of a sudden everybody says
hey who's that
who did they find
the cat
do we have a name for this cat
no
shall we give it one
no
you don't want to give it a name
how are you gonna call it if you don't know what his name is
you say
here
here wh here kitty kitty
okay
uh oh and now look what's happening
what's happening here
you know what that little boy's got on
well look on his t+shirt
who's that
Batman that's just like you can't it
and I think this police has fallen flat on his nose trying to catch that cat
kalunk
and then they're going along in the woods
and suddenly
the cat goes into a big pipe to hide
and then
uh oh
I see trouble
cause you see what's happening here
all these guys the policeman and the lady are going in this end of the tunnel
and if it comes out the other end then they're going to fall into the water
and the cat's sitting up here and the cat's going to laugh
ah that's right
he's Batman
and I think it's going to turn out that he knows better than the rest of them how to do this
what do you think
do you think he's going to be the hero of this story
uh oh what happened here hm
can you tell me what happened
that's right
he fell into the water
splush
and there goes that old cat
you see he's trying to help her out_of the pipe
and she falls down and kaplunk they both go into the water
what a mess
and now they're really getting wet
and the cat is jumping back in the pipe and going right back where they came from
and what are these people saying
I don't know
what are they saying
you don't know what they're saying
I think they're saying
stop you pesky cat
you're driving us crazy
we're gonna catch you
so then the lady and the policeman are putting their clothes back on
and they crawl into the pipe
and look at the other end
who turned out to have caught the cat
the boy
that's because little boys often know how to do things better than big people can't that right
hm
especially if they're Batman
oh
then he put the cat right on the policeman's head and the lady is grabbing the little boy by the ear
and what do you think she's telling him
I think she's saying something like um
that wasn't a very nice thing to do
but he after all caught the cat
so why should she complain right
and then the cat is about to go up the tree
yeah and xxx
look he scratched the policeman's face off
and then the policeman's trying to catch the cat
and here he got him
what do you think the cat
do you think that cat looks happy
he looks mad
the cat didn't want to get caught did he
I think the little boy likes the cat too
and the lady's sh
huh
uh oh
what happened
he's falling down
crash
the whole tree broke I think
look here
you can see where it breaks
and now the man's falling down out_of the tree
oh and that poor
what's the cat so unhappy about
the cat's alright
oh and here's the here's the boy going home on the in the baby buggy
and the policeman's limping home
and the cat's just following right along behind him
and then here's the lady
and she's telling them something
I wonder what she's saying to them there
maybe she's saying
if you guys will wait here patiently I'll go get you some ah chocolate chip cookies and milk
think that's what she's saying
she did
that's exactly what she said Charlie
look there's milk and chocolate chip cookies
and she's dressed up like a nurse
now you can do everything
now you have done everything
