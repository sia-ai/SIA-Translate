you_know it really was interesting that Mark said about rest my case you_know
this was something that was recorded I believe on the uh last tape
and she said
you_know it was a perfect use of it uh rhetorically
it's just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur
in other words ro Mark didn't could use it rhetorically correctly but didn't have_to use it metaphorically
uh that is the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation

I was talking to Ross about um
he was actually he was asking me who is my
let's see
who in my family uh liked me the most uh was I the most fa favorite of
or something like that
and I said
well my mother
and then I said
well
no he said
yeah
and I said
no well my father
and then he said
oh yeah I remember
you told me once that you had your father wrapped around your finger
or
you had your dad wrapped around your finger little finger
you had your dad wrapped around your little finger
and this is true
but the thing is I can't remember how long ago that was
it was really quite a long time ago
um I think it was at the beginning of this year sometime or at least at the beginning of the school year
but anyway he remembered it and he remembered how to say it also
I heard Mark say
we don't want no soap in the water
and Ross said back to him
any Mark
any
it's we don't want any soap in the water
Mark you have disgusting language
and Mark said
I just made a mistake Ross
I gave Mark a drink of water em because he wasn't quite g
well he was still awake in bed and I went in there and he asked me for a drink of water
so he finished the water and he said
thank_you Mom
the more I drink the more eat
with little hand movements
the more faster I fall asleep
Mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and Ross Mark said
it's because uh the the words are too little
and and Ross said
the reason he can't read it is because he can't see the words on the page
so my suggestion is that when he wants to read the words you write them up on a on a piece of paper so that he can see them
and what was interesting about that was this
my suggestion is
Mark's suggestion is
business is was well used
it was like part of a general solution to a problem that everybody was facing at this point
actually Mark's causing us all a_lot_of problems right now
he's sort_of being a little bit difficult let's say
xxx supposed to reach something so that he can get a He_Man toy
Ross uh that uh he was just Mister_Wonderful just like when he was a baby
he said
Mister_Wonderful the wrestler
uh
no no
and then he said
there is such a guy
in other words that's the first use of such in that sense that I'd ever in that specific sense that I'd ever noticed
