I'd like you to help me hang up the socks
I saw that you hung up the sock very nicely already
the black and white sock
you're very good at hanging the socks up
I think you did it very carefully
you wanna hang up the other sock
that one's the matching sock actually
yes
you're doing a very nice job
there's lots more socks there
oh this one fell down a little bit that's okay
um here I think
you can probably figure out which ones are matching
this one this shirt I need to
yeah
that's a matching sock isn't it
and that orange one matches
can you reach it
you can what
it was in the bath+tub yeah
you'll find another set of socks
another pair of socks
mhm
can I show you something
if you pull it way down
oops Mommy made that one fall
then they
then they won't fall as easily
see
I was wrong
that did fall down
what yellow things
oh those are little
looks like they used to be little plastic butter+flies
that are glued to the bath+tub so that
no so that a person taking a shower won't slip
it's okay they're just plastic
yes honey
are you scared
just give me a nice big hug
why are you scared
of the plastic
plastic is nothing to be scared of honey+bunny
you won't have_to pinch me I'll carry you
it's plastic
it won't hurt you
do you hear that
good
the camera is making noise but I also heard the church bell
I think it stopped already
that's the camera
let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play+ground
we need to hang them up first
you a little scared

yeah
you're with me
alright I'll hold you
where's your microphone
by the way
okay
I will hold you and hang up my laundry
but I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic
I'm not doing anything to it
it doesn't matter
nothing needs to be done with it
nothing at all
yeah plastic butterflies
that's what they're for
but you know what we don't even use this bath+tub
we don't even take showers in it
do we
we just use it to hang clothes
right
you wanna touch the
plastic butterfly
wanna touch it
want Mommy to touch it
okay
Mommy will touch it
yeah I'm rubbing it
it's flat
it's almost like a piece of paper
here actually you know what it peels right off
this is it
the plastic
we could throw them in the garbage
see it's plastic
should I see if I can get the other one off
you're standing on me
let's see if I can get peel the other one off too
we don't really need to have them in here
careful boo
this one is harder to get off
do you want to xxx
next to the toilet
you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage
yeah
yeah we took it off and we
put it in the and you Naima put it in the garbage
well I tried to peel that one off I had a little trouble
because it's kinda stuck
I'm not gonna do it right now right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry
you are
you smell very nice
you were but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage
you're not scared of that anymore I don't think so
yeah you know what I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there
I think that's what that is
here's another sock you could hang up
this is no actually
because this is gray and that's black
you're gonna need to look here
try to find a gray sock that matches
I don't know if it
it might not even be here
let's see where's the matching one
lalie lalie nursie
you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now
why don't you go and hang that up
can I show you something
okay watch me do it
I'm putting it over but then I'm gonna pull the other side
because that way it won't fall down easily
yeah that's another plastic butterfly
there's another sock
who's sock is that
that's a Daddy sock yeah
remember what I said about pulling it
here I'll get it for you
try again try again
try hanging it up again
no use your other hand
that's okay
okay put it up there
yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that
see that way it'll stay up it won't fall down that way
I'm showing you how to hang up the sock
there's another sock
try using both hands to make it stay
like I showed you
where's your other hand
where's your other hand
nope nope nope lemme have this hand
give me this hand
give me your hand
okay
