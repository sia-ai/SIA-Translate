they're still hard to train
what's that look like
yeah that's a picture of the circus
what do they look like
they're building the circus
they're breaking the ground for the tent
remember the guys laid a net out first
yeah
ropes to support the trapeze
that's right
to get to the trapeze
what happened when we were looking up
right
it sure does
uhhuh
uhhuh clowns are people
some of them are kids
and some of them are midgets
midgets are short people
no he got up and walked away
maybe she was sick
to make the show look really dangerous
they're not
juggle them
right
what part
for the lions to jump through
I bet she got sick
maybe
I saw that
oh we saw him lift up another lion
they have some wrong pictures in here
yeah most of them are right
you wouldn't be a elephant tamer
why not
and then dropped you
then you probably wouldn't give him a snack
he might be
there's a_lot_of things we can do tomorrow Abe
play the games in this book
would you like to put the poster in your room
how come
oh
no
because he's the circus' property
the circus people
the jungle

I don't care what you say
huh
could I
sure
yeah
really
okay
I would be
I would be what
okay are you ready
that was pretty funny when you kicked it

well you're supposed to catch it
what would happen if I threw this and it hit the ceiling
how come
oh are you ready
good one
you sure did
I guess you can't play football then
you ready
would it help you if we got a helmet
how would it help
and what would happen then
that's right
do you want me to hold it and you can kick it
okay you missed
I did not aim for the ball this time
okay
how come
how did water get on the football field
how come
I guess I should pour water on you then
I like you
okay
that's pretty hard isn't it
let me see
I'll show you what happens if you hold it like that
come on okay
kick it see
I have too much of my hand on the ball
if I have one finger it goes a_lot better
no one finger's all you need
look
yep
why
you told me what
okay
what do you mean
how many players
as many as you want
two or twenty it really doesn't matter
she's not home
do you want to play football some more
to talk to me
just to talk
what
he doesn't usually come
just once in a while
hut hut hut hut
it was a good catch
good kick
I know
that's right
none will be on untill tomorrow
yeah they are in the morning
then you'll have_to wait until next Saturday
do you want to take a bath
what are you trying to do
I'll help you
there you go
last night
what did you dream about it
why don't you tell me a story
any kind
that didn't make much sense
what would have happened if we wouldn't have gone to the circus
huh
we would have missed it
that wasn't too good
tell me a good story
what a story what would happen if I told you a story like that
isn't it on your bookshelf
ask your Dad
that's his area
I'm not sure Abe
how do you think they learn
I think you're right Abe
do babies try to learn how to talk
or do they just learn without trying
right I think you're right again
does somebody teach babies how to talk or do they just learn how to talk
are you sure
I see
the one we were looking for last night
go get the book
and we'll look for it
try this on
sure
let me find one that's empty
what are you going to do with it
huh
no that's white thread
I don't see any that are totally empty
no look at it
isn't that white thread
that's to wind the bobbin
here's one
you do like it
what is it Abe
how come we wouldn't have_to pay
it won't
why not
we would
Abe that is really a good idea
we'll have_to start looking for wood
let me look for that one guy
what does he look like
uhhuh
is he large or small
okay
okay is it this guy
which one
the one we're looking for or this one
okay
it looks like this guy
the picture has a_lot_of them in it
oh maybe it's not in this book
yes Abe
yeah that would really be something
why
oh that's right
Abe
what would we do if we got all those bones
huh
that's right
well this is the only picture
I think this is the only one
where
I sure can't find it
do you think it might be in a different book
in the back what
how come
so why don't we sit right here and look
what makes you think we can find it
are you sure it's not in another book
where are his bones
no I think they're really far up north
backwards
to see if you missed it back here
what kind of dinosaur do you think they would make
it's from a circular that we got
do you think the picture of the dinosaur could have been ripped out
I know
to see if we can find that picture is this it
this
a_lot_of what ones
here it is
is it a skeleton
I've looked through every page
and I couldn't find it
what
maybe the page got ripped out
is that him
he really looks rough doesn't he
sometimes he does
is this it
I think it might have been in a different book
Abe
remember when we went camping with Lou and Elliot
yeah what would have happened if we would have seen a bear
yeah but what else could have happened
is that what would have happened
what if the bear would have been a really fast runner too
right
I have_to go out and hang up clothes
huh
yeah I have_to hang out clothes first
to the museum
or for you to look at in the car
okay
to hang out clothes
do you want to go now or do you want me to wait until you're through with this
okay
just a second
where were they
they were angry because that guy went through their burial grounds
they were angry because that guy went through their burial grounds
that's where they bury everybody
I think it might be
those are just pictures
what thing
what thing's your thing
do you want toast
banana bread
okay dang it
Daddy spilled it
I will
let me wipe this up first okay
because when it fell it fell all over
yep
it was pretty big
where
yeah
yeah Abe
good deal
sure
why don't you let me
because there's a_lot_of stuff still on the floor
okay
I'll get it
no I'll put it on
because I don't want to make another mess for a little while okay
yeah I'm not going to cut it
because this bread is shaped differently
because I can see it
no it's round
but it's not very big
that's the way the loaf is shaped
the loaf is round
yeah
yep I know that
oh you didn't know until you tasted it
here's your milk
you're welcome is that good toast
how come
oh you don't like wheat bread
I thought you liked it
did you like that movie last night
what did you like best
oh
I liked watching him build the log cabin
I though that was pretty neat
I think she liked it all too
I did
I just liked some parts the best
don't spill it
huh
I know you didn't
I just want you to
huh
I didn't spill it
yeah but that wasn't what I was talking about it
huh
oh
yeah
what are you thinking about
oh
you can't
how come
what are you going to do then
what
why don't you eat one more bite
is this what you want
what would we have done if we wouldn't have taken any candy to the drivein last night
what
yeah what would we have done
would we still have had a good time
that's good
so we don't need candy
oh
I sure can't
where are you
you don't want me to look for you
you don't want me to look for you
okay Abe what would happen if I never found you
forever and ever
oh how come you're hiding
how come
of who
why
why
what
why
back in what
how are we going to build your fort then
we should use my saw and your drill
why
well why don't you do something
Abe's really going through a growth spurt
it means your body's growing
and you're hungry all the time
I don't think they can hear
why
they have_to hear so they can protect themselves
guess who I talked to at school today
the Tooth_Fairy
what do you think she said
she said
what does Abe want
a toy
when are you having your teeth pulled out
okay
Monday
okay I'll tell the Tooth_Fairy
who
the Tooth Fairy
I don't know
than a magician
Abe
do you remember when you were learning to talk
do you
could you think before you could talk
what
no what did you think
huh
before you could talk you thought about hitting me with pillows
oh
yeah
what
what bow and arrow
where is it
what's it doing in the car
when
do you want to go get it now
you were a big help Abe
let's practice
here's your brownie
waiting and waiting
yeah do you want one
yeah
thank_you
what's the problem
the arrow's too long
okay
yeah
yeah why don't you run upstairs and teetee first
I will
okay watch
yeah
okay
you're welcome Abe
okay
what
it did
you hit it
yeah you can shoot at whatever you want
that's really a big arrow
uhhuh
get some feathers for it
where do the wings go
okay
not my good ones
look on the bookshelf
I thought I did
yeah
I'll look
I don't think paper wings are a good idea Abe
okay
I do
how come you think I know
uhhuh
take careful aim
uhhuh
nope I'll show you how this'll work
probably
at least three
why
why do you think that happens
do you think the lighter the bow or the heavier the bow
how come
I think it's just the opposite
hey this is a crooked arrow
do you want to show me
I don't think it'll work with those feathers
I don't know
maybe we'll have_to find real bird feather
good
do you want me to make two arrows out_of this
I'll have_to cut it
no cut it
I'll go get my knife
was I fast enough for you
what
what's alive
why do you think it's alive
it hasn't been cut very long has it
there we go
now try to shoot that one
I bet it does a good job
how did it work
so you can have another arrow
uhhuh
what
uhhuh
I'm not
I love you too Abe
be careful
you almost shot a hole in the wall
if you shoot it hard enough then it'll make holes
yeah that's how come you should aim
did it help
did it shoot better
what is it
that's a good idea
I think we'll do that
would you like to go this week
okay do you want hot chocolate or milk
on tv
do you want me to fix your breakfast first or look for what's on tv first

oh what does that have_to do with the lawnmower
you have_to put your money on there when you pay for the lawnmower

you would have been sad
what would you have said to me and Mom
what could we have done
she would have said
I'm sorry Abe
I'll bring you something tonight
what would have happened then
we would have been real happy
I don't want to
what are you going to do

Abe do you mean it's as old as you
well look this is how big the rock is now
what's bigger
you or the rock
uhhuh
right
you're three and a half years old okay
and years aren't the same thing as inches
so the rock is three and a half inches tall
but you're three and a half years old
years aren't the same as inches okay
what
it'd be hard to balance it like that wouldn't it
oh just during the day
they all fit
okay how many did you get
oh what are you going to do with all those rocks
everyday
oh
what if they do
that would be pretty neat I think
oh
today

huh
it's on pretty soon
what is that
that's right
you made the letter eight
I mean number eight
uhhuh

the basket fell down
did they get hurt
what
she thought the dog was sorry
what
did you eat one
you know what
you're starting to look like a monster
did anything else happen at the store
what
what would have happened if Danny and Andy would have got their heads cut when the basket fell
you would have had to take them to the hospital
what would have happened there
you spent it
what did you get
can I have a bite
oh Abe I'm so hungry for a candybar
two candybars
you can save them for later if you want to

where are going to take the dirt
to dirt piles
where's the paper

Abe could you make Mommy's wound better
what makes you think it's better
yeah it did
now I'm going to teach you a lesson
hey don't pull my hair

I know
but what would we drink
oh
hey do you want me to tie you up and you can try to escape
okay try to get out
you should try to take the rope off before you try to walk
you could walk better if you take the rope off
okay I won't
