how do you think the people would feel if they had dinosaurs on their house
do you think they'd like it
how about these particular one would they want these kinds you think
can I tell you something I don't want these on their house okay
if anyone offers you the chance and says do you want dinosaurs on your house I want you to say no
oh no
every time you're going to say yes
so I'm trying to think about different things you've been doing
we went to see Holes at the Fredonia Opera House which is very interesting
what's different about the Fredonia Opera House
mhm do you remember what they call the upstairs room
close b b
yeah balcony that's right
and we say um someone that you used to know at school there too
now was Jackson your friend at school or was he just a kid you knew at school
how come you weren't friends with him
what did he do that was bad
at your old school he did stuff bad like what
that was a while ago wasn't it
you have another kid at your school now who gets into trouble all the time
yeah what does Dawson do that's a problem at your school
oh_my_goodness
he punched you in the tummy
oh_my_goodness
what did you do when you did that
nothing
wow what else does he do sometimes
one time he bit Mckayla
this is bad news
honey don't break that okay
what is that
do I want it
am I supposed to buy it or something
let me check him out first and see if I want him
he's kinda wiggly
ah oh_my_goodness
he's super stretchy
I dunno
what uh what does he do
is he real or is he just decoration
ah really
he's just in a sleep time
so that's why he's kinda still right now
um I was trying to think about some stuff we've been doing lately
we went to the movies and we saw these lizards
you went to go see another movie too with Daddy
Brother Bear did you like it
yeah what happens in the movie what's interesting
well just say one part of it what is interesting
it could be a scary or sad part whatever
they killed the bear
was it a big bear or a little bear
who was the big bear
mhm
what happens to Koda then
that's the Brother so Koda just stays with him
alright I'll buy him
how much does he cost though
wait wait now don't keep charging him up
I don't want to buy five lizards just one
okay
oh wait no not two not three
not so many lizards just one
nineteen lizards
how much does it cost
y
I dunno just tell me
one oh one actually starts with an o
one what
one penny
one dollar
is it one dollar for all nineteen lizards or one dollar for each lizard
so I owe you nineteen dollars
oh here you go
thank you
now what do they eat
anything how about you
do they eat people
no do they eat orange juice
I'll take all these groceries and see what he likes
how much does this cost
thirty two dollars and forty one cents for all these groceries
alright here's your money
alrighty well I don't think I need anything else
bye bye
yes but I really wanted this pet so I'm gonna keep him and see how it goes at home
if anything bad happens okay
here I'll call you up with a question
you know well there was this basket that the food came in
I was wondering if that could be a good home for him
today you're too busy
how do you think he like his new house
is part of him hanging out
oh that's no good
dump stuff on him oh my gosh
no he'll get all messy
what else are you gonna dump on him
oh man that's gonna be a messy lizard
wait wait is this how you used to take care of him when you had him
why are you dumping stuff on him
to clean him that's the stuff that makes him messy
but you know what I'm gonna run out of food now
you're dumping all our food out on him all the stuff to drink
well
you will
okay are you washing him
that's bread isn't it
it's a washcloth oh okay
so he's all clean again let me smell him
oh he smells like ketchup still
but he does look pretty clean that was a good idea I guess
is that his next food he's supposed to eat him
oh yeah he really likes this long neck dinosaur Brachiosaurous
what do you wanna do with those Matty
what do you need with that one
wait wait wait don't hurt him
wait wait wait no no no he's not to play baseball with
don't he's my pet
he's my pet
no that's not very nice
this reminds me of when we were playing hockey yesterday though
yeah well just because you swing and hit something with a stick right
did we play hockey on the ground
can you tell Leslie about how we played hockey yesterday about how I won by so much
well how did you win by so much
yes
what are you gonna do with the lizard
no I don't want you pretending that it seems very aggressive to me
it's mean it's a pet
you're the one who told me he was real
was he gonna eat this
to eat me
ouch ouch he bit my hand
he's really bad I think I want to return him here
I want a different pet please
should I come into the store again and choose something else
so do you wanna talk about the day you stayed home with Daddy
no
should we just go home now
you don't want to play with Leslie's toys anymore
then why don't we do our stuff
I want you to apologize to the lizard
are you gonna be gentle with him now
so do you wanna talk about when you stayed home with your daddy
why did you get to say home what was going on
how come
well what was very interesting that happened to our house during that wind storm
what happened to our trees
yeah two of the got blowed over totally
huge huge huge parts of the tree right Matty
so um what are we gonna do with those trees now
mhm and then what
are we gonna put all the pieces in your room
what's gonna happen to the pieces of wood do you know
for who
where's the fire
up the chimney right
I think the neighbor's going to take some of it too
now what's gonna be an interesting thing that's gonna happen this week
mhm and what are you gonna do while I'm gone
Daddy's taking you to Splash Lagoon
oh_my_goodness
mm Cindy's on Friday you're going to Cindy's house right
what kinda stuff do you do at Cindy's
cool you got somebody else's house you're gonna visit too while I'm gone
Roman's okay
I was gonna say Romulous
Roman's yes
and he's is gonna take you to gymnastics and then you'll go to Roman's house for supper and you even have_to bring over your what to Roman's house
your what
he's been very interested in spelling things like what sounds go with what letters
sleeping bag
what does sleeping bag end with
yeah sleeping bag
sleeping also ends in g doesn't it
yes because you're not gonna sleep the whole night there but Daddy has parent teacher conferences so you gotta stay at their house for awhile
I just wanted to tell you though tell me what you think about this I really want to go to Splash Lagoon so I'm thinking maybe you guys shouldn't go because I can't go with
you're gonna go but I've never even been there
when do I get to go
I hope so
ten days from now hm
maybe possibly that could be a potential time
xxx take you to the water park there's one apparently in Toronto
yeah you guys might go to that one instead
it's not exactly the same
it's similar but its not called Splash Lagoon
that doesn't roll real well does it
it's not like a car it's just a little trailer guy
you need a car to go down there hm
I dunno we'll have_to see if they got a car here
so what do people even do at Splash Lagoon since I've never even been there
what do people do
do you wanna see if this one works
oh that's pretty good
alright I'll let you do it one more time and then we'll do something else for a while
do you know what happens with this it ends up being loud okay
you won't really be able to be right on the tape if you do that
so Matty you're really not gonna wait for me to go to Splash Lagoon with you
how about you remember what happens next week
what holiday's next week and you don't have school for a couple of days
what
Splash Lagoon that's not the name of the holiday
I'll give you a hint thanks
right who's coming to visit
who
Grandma and Grandma
yeah Grandma Sharon and Grandma Zevenbergen are coming right
and Grandpa Dale and Grandpa Zevenbergen are staying home right
not your two Grandmas Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale are coming
what are you gonna show then in your house that they would find interesting do you think
and what are you gonna do with them
oh_my_goodness they're gonna drive in the car
we'll wait until we're done with the tape for you to roll that again
I'll give you a couple times to do it because it is loud
but you can get them ready for them to drive if you want
so I'm wondering about maybe if we should
listen honey I thought we should take Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale maybe to uh
no not to Splash Lagoon
I think Grandpa Dale might like it Grandma Sharon would not want to go swimming there at all
I dunno she doesn't like to go swimming
I don't think I've ever seen her in a bathing suit
are you sleeping
so Leslie might think that these are really your real clothes but what's up with these clothes we got on here
did you just take the whole milk think and dump it over your head or what happened
and it went everywhere everywhere
oh that's a beautiful dress
and is that your beautiful headband
your hair cover
maybe this would be good remember how we were worried that it might start raining outside
if you had this on your hair would stay dry
and everybody would say why does that kid got that on his head though
hm
so I was saying when Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale come should we take them maybe to Niagara_Falls
Stinky's where's Stinky's
oh there's an aquarium by Niagara Falls that's a little one though
do you know where Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale have been before where we have also been
they went to Lion Country Safaris one time
we love that place remember
why
I don't want you to fall down though
do you wanna be able to fall
well what if you hurt your head
are you gonna fall down gently
okay ready
Lion Country Safari
oh_my_goodness you fainted
oh let's dump a bunch of juice on his head
wait let's wake you up hold on stay right there
this will wake you up all of these different drinks
I'll dump them on your head
there's nothing in these
one time in the summer I remember you and I went to the Lake Erie state park and it was super hot and we dumped water on our heads
do you remember that
a little bit do you remember that time
I knew you didn't it was hot and we were climbing up the rocks and we brought water bottles and we squirted them on each other's heads
well it was fun
maybe you just don't remember it
real water
no no no
it would work in here but then it would you know get the lab all wet
everything would be super duper wet
and then dump water in the bathroom
do you think the custodian wants to clean that up
I don't think so
you know Matty we have_to write our Christmas list soon for Grandma and Grandpa and Santa and stuff like that
well you just asked him for that one thing
do you have any other ideas of what you would like for Christmas
whoa I'd say that's pretty loud what do you think
no it's too loud this is super duper duper loud
I don't think Leslie has seen your shoes had you noticed his shoes
yup they're really cool huh
so what do you want for Christmas
you want a kitty
see I guess he doesn't really want gifts this year because he can't really think of anything
oh you've been maybe you're getting some new games because you've been actually playing this one game all the time at home
what's the game we play almost everyday now
oh my gosh you're so funny with that today
it's actually called it reminds me of
it's in your hand
Choo Choo's
well let me see if I can explain how to do the game right and if I do it wrong you can tell me
it's called Chutes and Ladders and what you gotta do is
no it's not called Hoops and Ladder you silly guy
doctor Weist is gonna be totally surprised that you said that on the tape
he's gonna say how come that little boys is saying that word
anyway so Chutes and Ladders what you gotta do is you gotta climb up the chutes and then you walk down the ladders right
go down the ladders
you just go up and down the ladders
I see how do you win the game
to the bottom
I see whoever gets to the bottom first wins right
do you know the number you have_to get to be the winner what number it is for the winning
no we never talked about it
it's a hundred when you get to one hundred you win
why are you screaming
Dutes
so yes we've been playing Chutes and Ladders nearly everyday
I think our tape's gonna be over soon
what would you like to do babe
alright open them
don't dump them some of them are ceramic in there
we don't want them to break
some of the pieces are pretty breakable
sorry okay
a squishy web thing that was a squishy web thing huh
oh I know what he's talking about
a squishy squishy web thing
oh she totally knows
that was Roman's favorite too
isn't that funny because we know how much Roman likes Spiderman too right
do you remember what did Roman you have for his birthday party when he turned four
Batman
see I try to think about it this time he had Batman stuff remember
I think I think when he turned four remember he had just you there for his party and he just had and he had Spiderman you guys got a couple little Spiderman
oh look she found another one another one
oh_my_goodness we haven't seen him in a long time
that's totally cool
another dinosaur for the selling
well that's good
we can sell a bunch of people see we got all kinds of stuff
um so so what do we usually do in here Boo so that she knows how how we are supposed to do everything
you forget since the last time
hm
well you should remember do you wanna show her how we do the playing the selling game
whatever dinosaur I want I can buy it
well is there any one particular one that you would recommend
yeah we are not really sure where they are but how many do we have
and then five right is he a dinosaur
what is he from
yeah
we haven't watched this one in a while it's from Lion King
so anyways so okay well let's do that let's starts exactly when where um I'm gonna buy a dinosaur um okay
um could you tell me about this one
he eats plants okay
um how does he sleep at night I don't want an animal that is going to keep me up all night
he just lays down
what kind of a bed does he sleep in
I thought dinosaurs slept in beds
no
what do they sleep in
oh
oh so all I need to do is put him on the ground okay and he eats plants
okay well alright I'll try it I'll take em okay
are you getting out my money for me because I actually have_to pay you right
um hm that's right
you're just grabbing the money out right
okay here
oh but I don't have any other money to give you alright here here let's see
is this money you can use
there is no money in you hand
there's nothing in my hand
oh well how about this
okay
that was funny honey kinda right
just kidding it's bread
we'll just use that yeah it's just bread
well you know we can eat the bread
fair trade
okay what is the funny thing that we usually play with the dinosaurs remember what did you used to do when I would give you money
you would always eat the money it was so funny
remember that
and Leslie we made that up
um hm
so okay well anyway thank you this is my change
okay now um do you have any um I was thinking about him sleeping
do you sell pajamas
my house is kinda cold what would you recommend
and get pajamas there
oh okay so you think he would wear pajamas
okay I I'll go I'll buy some at the store alright
wait wait wait I only want him
well are but aren't they gonna fight
that's a lot of pets
yeah that's what I am wondering about huh alright
yes you haven't who is that
yeah
oh_my_goodness though we shouldn't use this this is got a sword
what is that
you haven't watched the movie in awhile it is called the Golden
the Golden Snitch
um hm
remember
oh we really haven't watched that in a while
what's your new favorite movie that you just got
that was my favorite movie when I was little
really well they just came out with which number
ten
wow
ten yes
what's that one about
okay
did they go to the green field again
no
oh really
do they go there and eat
oh
so what are they supposed to do
oh
so it became dark because the moon was covering the sun and the long_necks thought they had to what did they think they were supposed to do to push the sun back up again
as hard and as long as they could and that would put the sun back up again
but there's another interesting part of the movie too who does Little Foot meet for the first time
um hm Little Foot's daddy
aw
so then what does he do with his daddy in the this ah because you know he kinda has a decision to make right at the end to make a choice what does he end up doing
you forget
um hm
he had to make a decision if he was going to go back with his dad
because what was his dad doing that was pretty cool
his dad was a leader of a herd so he thought that was pretty cool but then he decided that he was just gonna stay with his grandma and grandpa
so it was a great great new movie we just got the other day
so
yeah we got it when did we get it we got it like maybe Sunday
where'd you get it from
they brought it home to you
oh
we bought it at Walmart
because where were you when Mommy and Daddy went shopping
actually no it was on a Sunday
whose friends did you go over and you went sledding
you forget whose house you were over
you do forget
Jimmy and Erica's
oh_my_goodness now who are Cody and Kailia
and where do they live
oh_my_goodness so we weren't at their house actually were we
no but you were thinking of their names
thank you I noticed it actually makes a very very nice hat
what show me
what are webs for
um hm
and who who uses webs
um hm
do you like spiders
you do
he does pretty much right
sometimes we collect them in the Summer
he has all kinds of little collection kits right Boo
oh wow
uh huh we collect bugs all kinds of little bugs
what else did you collect this Summer that you brought home and we put it in a big aquarium thing
you forget
it's a snake
a snake
um hm
do you still have him
oh what happened
oh
where'd we find the snake
um hm
what was he doing
yeah
and then you and Daddy caught him right
he was cool but what did he do sometime he was kinda scared because what happened when you would go right by his cage what would he do
he would strike strike
how scary
what'd you do when he did that
he wouldn't jump
he was inside a glass
oh
he didn't seem very happy to be in the cage or in the glass aquarium so we let him go
yep
yeah
but um you know um Doctor Weist was wondering if we would talk about what our vacation plans are where we're going over Christmas
where are we going
and what are we going to go to to see in Chicago
um hm
wow
and what is so interesting about the Sears Tower
is it really
uh hum it is we've never been we saw it right Matty
how do we go in it
do we crawl up the side or how do we go in it you think
there's probably a door yeah
probably is and then we go inside well you and Daddy went to a big tall tall thing in um Niagara Falls right
yeah
how did you get up to the top there
um hm you took an elevator yeah
was that the C_N Tower
um I forget I didn't go
did it rotate
does he know what that means
did it go around and around Matty
the top part that you were at
no
I don't know
but it was a tall thing so that's right though that's what I was thinking you took an elevator to get there
there was a couple elevators
um well we're gonna go up up up in the Sears Tower for sure
you know how many I should tell you how many days until we go there actually it might be very interesting
today's Friday okay
so we got Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
five days
wow
well we are actually leaving for Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale in three days
Monday and then on Wednesday we'll probably go to the Sears Tower
are you excited for Christmas
what did you ask for
oh a remote control car
just anything
remote control
so I don't really remember hearing too much about that particular thing
was there anything else you wanted
there is one thing that I know you wanted but um but then you said that somebody else at school was gonna get it for you
do you remember what that was
what is it
Barbie of Swan Lake movie yes
so so he's thinking maybe somebody at school will get it for him
oh
but I actually remember I was gonna buy you a d_v_d too
um xxx it's well a movie that you really really like a lot
I'll give you a hint it starts with a w
Wil
Willy
we love that one
that is a good movie
so that is a good movie
did you have you ever seen that movie
uh uh
oh_my_goodness you gotta tell her
what happens in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory
oh wow
do they get to eat chocolate
wow
one kid remember he tried to have too much chocolate what happened to him
Agustus
um hm
there was this whole river made out of chocolate and he was drinking it right
yep
what happened to that one girl that was very spoiled
yeah what is she asking for
do you remember what she was asking for
um hm
what happened to Charlie
nothing
what happened to Mike t_v
what happened to Mike t_v
um hm
that's right he wanted to be the first person to travel by t_v waves right
remember he was floating all above them in little tiny pieces
and then he showed up on the t_v screen
um hm
but you know Carey is right about something something happens to Charlie and Grandpa Joe
how did they almost get hurt
yeah
how did that happened
do you know what was funny
how did they get down
burped all the way down
and there were bubbles huh
yeah
good movie
yep that's a really really good movie
then I'm trying to remember so we talked about what happened on Mike t_v Agustus glue ah what happened to that one girl who ate the gum
Violet
and what did the Umpa Lumpas do to her
uhhuh
did they role her away
do you remember
yeah that was funny
yeah you're right though they had to take her to the juicer room
it's totally funny
what song did they sing
do you remember it
how does it go
it is
good memory
I don't remember much about the rest of the song because they have a little different songs for each of the different kids right
um hm
so this is this is a very interesting part of the movie to me because at the end of it remember he first told Charlie that he lost
um hm and then he said you win but what you know what this is funny what's the part of the movie that could never really happen
like what's the deal with Grandpa Joe and the bed
yep he just got up and danced didn't he
that could never happen right
that was totally funny
so anyway yeah so that's one of the gifts that I got you remember
you're gonna get to open it so you can take it on the trip
you know so you have it to watch it in the car xxx
I got it with when I was with Daddy same day
we had a good time at Walmart
we all kinds of stuff that day
what do you remember did Daddy tell you what we're gonna go do tonight
um well we're gonna go shopping again
we just have_to finish our shopping
but you know what I was thinking we will probably go out to eat dinner
what's your favorite place to eat that we might go to
Mcdonalds is your favorite place
yeah
it seems like it has gum in it honey
what is it
picture
did you make it Matty
oh_my_goodness that is beautiful where'd you get that
oh_my_goodness you totally found it you must have been so excited that you found it again
yeah
um can I see it
I won't loose it
that was a smart idea to wrap it up in there
oh it's beautiful
is that a bead
um hm
you know what it looks like to me
doesn't it look quite a bit like a diamond
wow
he is like give it back
maybe what you know maybe it is a diamond
how do you know maybe it truly is a diamond
yeah to be able to put it on a ring or in a necklace or something
do you know do you know where diamonds come from
compressed charcoal
do you know what that means
over a long period of time charcoal gets pushed down by the earth and then it forms into diamonds and crystalizes
pretty cool huh
go tell Roman that
Roman is really funny
you didn't see him today but we saw him yesterday at gymnastics right
yes believe it or not guess what he's gonna do tomorrow night
what were we talking about this morning
oh wow
talk about what what you guys might do
what would you like to do with Roman and Sophie
play what
play Shoots and Ladders
yes that's a very fun game definitely a fun game
anything else
and Candy Land too yes
where
oh I just didn't know where you were going
oh that reminds me though
what did we forget to bring back today
uh oh
we have another car that we borrowed yes
that's okay
yes
we trust you
we took it out we just totally forgot to bring it back though
yeah
so I was thinking about hm well do you know about our what we're gonna do on our trip Matty
well you know we're gonna go to the Sears Towers right
and we're gonna go Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale's
we're gonna go to the museum
which museum
oh the dinosaur museum
why don't you come over here honey
I can't see you or hear you
you can play with the car at the end
the dinosaur museum yes
that is totally cool
what do you think that they'll have there
yeah
I bet you're right what else do they tend to have at those kind of museums
what
well sometimes they have animals that are like dead right
not just the bones but the whole animal right
yeah so you can see what the animals look like
it's almost like a zoo kinda right
except
xxx I know I always thought that that was very odd actually
when they try to you know they set up the dioramas and displays and stuff
yep
in their little natural habitats
but you had an idea he was so funny remember Matty you said how many days are we gonna be at Grandma Sharon's and Grandpa Dales and I said four and he said well that should be enough days because he wanted to go to my parents actually live an hour and a half from Chicago
um hm
so he was like well that will give us three days one day to go to Sears Towers right one day to go to the dinosaur museum and what was the other place you wanted to go
oh you don't remember
hm you went there this Summer with Daddy and you and Daddy had a really good time
you still don't remember
let me give you a hint
oh now you remember okay what
oh wow
aquarium but we decided we probably will only go to Chicago one one day
Sears Towers and dinosaur museum right
in one day
it's gonna be a long day right
yeah
yeah
and then also on the trip you're gonna go visit
Grandma and Grandpa
yes
what do you think you'll do there
are you gonna eat
what will you have
what's your favorite food
you say that
I think that's probably true you tend to choose those a lot
or noodles you tend to like curly noodles cheesy noodles right
pizza
I know what I would say your favorite food is
I gonna have a new guess
okay and then tell me which one truly is your favorite
could it possibly be mozzarella sticks cheese sticks
do you like those better than chicken nuggets or you like chicken nuggets better
which one do you eat more
um more recently you probably eat the cheese sticks a little bit more often
cheese sticks
so at Grandma Grandma and Grandpa Zevenburgen's we don't do that many specific things
we tend to just visit
because there's lots_of family there right
Cody and Kaylia and Heidi and the new baby and and then Jaden right
yeah they probably don't know who Jaden is though
who is Jaden
you forget
because you haven't seen here in a long time that's true probably
you know what
I just was thinking it might actually be two years since you've seen Jaden
whoa that is a long time honey
that's amazing
I could be right though yeah
anyway that's his cousin but we don't really see them because Cody and Kaylia they came with us
remember they don't know about the trip this Summer
when we went to where with Cody and Kaylia
you forget
where did they have very big buildings and the Statue of Liberty
right
