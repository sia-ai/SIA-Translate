I've tried to call your parents but there's no answer
I'll take you home myself

they had not gone far when Isabelle said wait I hear voices
it was Babar and Rataxes
Celeste and lady Rataxes were there too
everyone had been xxx searching for the children and now they were arguing
what have you done with Vik shouted Rataxes
I bet he's with Babar's little girl said Lady Rataxes
Babar shook his head angrily
I have no idea where Vik is he said
I'm looking for Isabelle and I'm as worried as you are
the children ran to their parents
here we are they cried
thank you so much for bringing the children back safely Babar said to Murphy
but lady Rataxes was still angry
keep your daughter away from our son she said
let's get home now said Babar
and as they drove off towards Celeste_Ville Isabelle waved
bless you
Isabelle waved to her friend
and Vik waved back
Isabelle couldn't stop thinking about her friend

one morning Ariel the Little_Mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend
Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer+people
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
xxx while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he said
did you hear something
suddenly a very large
shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
ooh it's a big concert

what's the story called
The Dance lesson
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
that means me too
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
they loved their Cinderellee
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
mend my dress screeched Anastasia
polish my shoes whined Rosella
iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
are they nice
no they're not so nice
but is Cinderella nice
she's nice
and are Cinderella's friends nice
yes
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
suddenly Jack had an idea
I know he said
we'll help Cinderella
all the other mice nodded in agreement
what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
you're so good to me
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
I don't even know how to dance
dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
we'll show you to dance easy as pie
with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
dance please Missy he asked
Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
Cinderella watched and copied their movements
just listen and move see said Perla
not so scary
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
good Cinderella said Jack beaming
lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
the mice collapsed on the floor laughing
lets
oh there's Ariel
a Special surprise
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
it's almost time for the party
we can't be late
trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
they began their journey toward the surface
but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
remember last time
your father got so angry
you know how he feels about humans
that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
and Flounder raced to catch up
just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
no
what do you think's happening
well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration

yeah
Sebastian fell in the water again
yeah
prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
Flounder spotted the prince first
look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince_Eric
it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
ready asked Flounder
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
she sang a song she had written just for Eric
it was Ariel's special gift for him
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
it can't be he said
I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
who are you he called out into the night
but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home
