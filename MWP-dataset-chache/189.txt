I think
okay I have this exciting book here that I'd like to read to you
what
what do you want to show me
oh well there's only
yup
this one
good
okay
okay The_great_cat_chase
did your daddy read a book like this to you
oh well there's a little girl
do you know her name
well we better give her a name
okay her name is um Mathilda
and Mathilda had a little pussy cat
that she played with and she would pretend that her pussy cat was her baby
well one day she stopped and she saw some lovely flowers
she went to pick it and her pussy cat didn't like pretending it was a baby so it jumped out_of the baby carriage
when Mathilda turned around her baby was gone
and she said
oh dear
where has my baby gone
and there's her baby
here's the pussy cat right behind a tree
but Mathilda doesn't know that
and so she goes running down the street
help
help
and there she sees her friend Charlie pretending he's a policeman
and Charlie stops all the traffic and says
I'm a policeman
I can help you
and xxx she says
my baby
he's gone
my pussy cat
she jumped out_of the baby carriage
and Charlie says
she's right behind you
there she is
see
I told you I could help you find her
and you can see Mathilda's very very happy
now they have_to get the pussy cat back
and Charlie sets down low and tries to creep along to get the um pussy cat
the pussy cat
what kind
look at that face what do you think the pussy cat's saying
you want me to tell you
he's saying
I don't want to go back into that baby carriage
sure enough just as Charlie reaches out to get the pussy cat the pussy cat runs away
and Mathilda is very upset and says
you get my pussy cat for me
ah notice that this little fella here
we'll have_to give him a name
do you know his name
we have Charlie
should we name him Craig
okay that's Craig
Craig thinks this is all very funny and first he's getting kinda bored
when Charlie was gonna try and get the pussy cat and the pussy cat runs away he thinks it's pretty funny
is it coming off a little bit
okay
yes he's got a policeman's whistle so there is Charlie and Mathilda tip oh tiptoeing along
okay
no there's no spider in it I think we would get a little bit more out if you blow hard
ah that's good
does it hurt
okay now the pussy cat begins to go into a big tunnel here
and here comes Mathilda and Charlie following
and Craig's just following along to see what happens
there goes Charlie
he jogs into the tunnel too to following the pussy cat
and see
this tunnel goes through a big mound of the dirt
and there's the pussycat standing on top of the tunnel
he's gone out
he's walled through and climbed up on top
and at the other end of the tunnel is a puddle of water
I guess it's more than a puddle
it must be a river
hm I wonder what happens next
they all go in the tunnel
poor Charlie falls in and gets wet
and there's Mathilda saying
there goes my pussy cat
hurry up and get her
then here Charlie's very surprised when he falls out
here I think he's getting angry with Mathilda
cause he's trying his best and she's yelling at him saying
there goes my pussycat
you go get him
hm he tries to help Mathilda out and what happens
look what happens
she falls on top of him
the pussy cat thinks this is pretty funny
there they all are
they're sopping wet in the water
and the pussy cat jumps back into the tunnel
so now what happens but Mathilda and Charlie have_to go back through the tunnel
and look_it here
here is Craig sitting on the top and he catches the pussy cat
hah and the pussy cat who really doesn't want to be caught jumps on top of Charlie's head
and Charlie's saying
get off of my head
get off of my head
and Mathilda is saying something here to Craig
she's saying
you have_to be gentle with my pussy cat
the pussy cat gets off of Charlie's face and starts running up the tree
this pussy cat is really trying very hard not to get caught
he climbs up the tree and he jumps over to this branch
now he doesn't have any place to go so Charlie reaches over and gets a hold of the cat and picks up the cat by the back of his neck
and that doesn't bother the pussy cat
cats don't mind being picked up that way
oh I'm sorry
um and here's Mathilda ever so happy that Charlie got the cat
but Craig isn't so ha happy any more cause he thought he was going to be able to get it
just then what happens
look_it there
the branch begins to break and Charlie drops the pussycat right into the arms of Mathilda
now Mathilda has the pussy cat
but poor Charlie has landed right on top of Craig
ah and look who ends up in the baby carriage
not the pussy cat but Craig because poor Charlie landed on top of Craig and look at poor Charlie
he's got scratches on his face and he's got this stick here that he has_to use as his cane
now Mathilda says
now you fellas you wait right out here
I'll be back in a moment
and here she is
now she's pretending she's the nurse she brings out some lemonade and cookies and glasses to drink
and she's going to make them better huh
because here's Charlie who's got scratches on his face and bruises from falling out_of the tree
and so he needs something to make him feel better

but I don't know Terry
do you think
oh
hm
oh
try em all
you're very clever Theresa
I didn't even think of that
oh do you think that might do it
see if you can push it with that
ya know
I didn't even think of that
maybe if I held this and you pushed the screw
let's try maybe another tool might do it
let's try another one
okay
okay
maybe
I think
maybe try turning it the other way
you'll do it
okay
I do believe it's gonna come out
you're so smart
I didn't even think of using those tools
you're a smart kid Theresa
yeah
but first we're gonna take apart the truck and put it back together again
okay
no
the other way honey
turn the other way
mhm
oop
I think I see it coming out
yeah
mhm
I think you can do it with your hand now
oop
boom
oh
you're so smart
okay
what's next
right
there
that's the way it goes
mhm
yeah
okay
okay
that's a good idea
good
you're really uh
quite a mechanic there Theresa
do you think you could change the tire on our car now
if we got a flat tire
do you think you could do that
good
oh
try it both ways see if you can figure it out
mhm
I think maybe the other way honey
right
okay
see
I think you're getting it now
is it hard to do
no
oh
you see
we didn't even have_to bring the car to the to the gas station
you could've done the whole thing
no
you're repairing the car
what's wrong with the car
why do you have_to repair it

that's right
they look like the headlights on the car
