Oriana the orangutan
Oriana lives in the jungle she rides on her mother's back
Oriana has long arms she swings in the trees
Oriana eats lots_of fruit she likes oranges best
it rains a lot in the jungle Oriana does not like to get wet
orangutans take good care of their babies a big hug makes Oriana feel safe
look at her do hugs make you feel safe
