you ask him that when he comes
it's the present for xxx
it's a book for xxx
it's his birthday is coming up
it's the eye of a fisherman book remember that
are you ready to do some eating do you think
Naima I don't want those all over the place okay
are you taking them out
don't spread them all over the place please
oh you're gonna do that
okay
xxx who's that
who's that
what
it's Daddy sweetie it's just Daddy
it's just Daddy
here's my
where's my darling daughter
where am I supposed to get the stings
oh
are there supposed to be
oh I don't know
xxx remember that game
I understand
yes he doesn't know
that's okay that he doesn't know he doesn't have_to know
can you say hi to Daddy
I think is it on the back
tickle the tickle bee around the maze with as few stings as possible
follow drawing on how to do tickle
when the head of the tickle bee is touched
by the magnetic tickler
this is considered a sting
I see what you're supposed to do
oh I see
you're supposed to push it like this
that's how you do it you push it like this
and if it hits
if you hit it that's a sting
that's how it works
mm well it's just a pretend sting
it's a pretend sting in the game
that's what it is
I'm gonna get comfy
yeah when it
you see if you do that side it touches the head that's a sting
if you do this side it pushes the tail and xxx moves it along
that's not a sting
that's how it works
I'm gonna get comfy
good idea
get comfy Daddy
okay
that's it for this taping
speaking of keys where are they
xxx xxx Naima can you tell me what the date is today
dyou remember what we said
seventh of what month
what month is it
you remember

you're gonna throw what in the stroller
hm
the bookstore was closed that day too
did you see someone opening it with keys
do you mean Barnes and Noble
you were there so early that they hadn't even opened yet

oh it is
he's shy about having his picture taken
yes
uh it's not food
are you pretending it's food
mhm
xxx this is the microphone part is this part right here xxx
and that back there is the transmitter in your pocket
yes
that's a very grownup thing to have in your pocket
I've got one in my pocket too
hm hm
mhm
you're his mommy
is his mommy hungry
does she need to eat
you could eat some grown+up food
if you were hungry
does Sleepy Bear's mommy eat grown+up food usually
oh she likes that
I heard you
okay
did he have his supper
oh
so he didn't have anything stinging because he didn't have any boo+boos even though he ate with his hands
oh
that's good
but there's another reason not to eat with your hands
even if you don't have boo+boos you might decide to eat with a fork and a spoon
you know why
because then your hands stay clean
and that's kinda nice
it means that when you're finished eating all you have_to do is wipe them a little bit on a napkin
they're both shy about having their picture taken
why is that
why are they shy
is that how you have your picture taken
oh
should I bring the camera and be the person taking their picture xxx
and they can pretend to be shy
mm okay
mhm
mm
oh what a great idea
I will bring the camera in there
and take a picture like that
oh
I'm looking for the camera
no I have
well that's a different camera Honey
you want to stand there again
I'll take a picture of you with him there
you hafta stay still and you hafta smile and you hafta ask him to smile
you gonna hold the handle of the stroller to show that you're strolling him in the picture

there it is
that's you
Sleepy Bear and his mommy
that's a nice picture

well I have_to erase some more pictures to make enough room
for me to take more pictures so you have_to wait just a minute while I do that
are you gonna tell me if you need a potty Honey
would you wanna put some socks on to keep your feet warm
because it looks like maybe your feet are cold
okay
you sure
am I an obstacle course
you just leapt over my leg

leapt means leaped
it looks like you're getting toasty warm on that heating vent
I'm worried that you might be a little cold

I wondered if that's what you were thinking about
you were only there once really
well we went to check and see if they were open yet but there were a lot of people in line
that's true
you thinking trying to think of other stores in the mall you could open up or go to
you know there's a toy store in the mall
you wanna take Sleepy Bear to that toy store
I don't think you know the name of it
it's called uh The Learning Connection or something like that
but it's a toy store in the mall
it's the toy store where we got the felt board
I don't know if you
you probably don't remember that
it's in the mall
and there's clothing stores in the mall
there are definitely clothing stores
that's good
he doesn't need them does he because he's got fur
how about we could pretend there's a salmon store in the mall
bear grocery store with just things that bears like
mm
hm
how about nuts
what other kinds of nuts
what was that other kind in in addition to hazel nuts that you just mentioned
mhm
how about peanuts
peanuts are nuts too
yeah
no I know you don't
well it's one of those things
some people like some foods and other people don't
it doesn't have_to do with whether you're grown+up or not really
just has to do with people people liking different things
like I like chocolate and you don't
and
let's see Daddy like

I'll go check and see who it is
something's in here
it's a duckling
Sleepy Bear is this your duckling
oh
why is the duckling scared
oh that's nice
what are you gonna do to comfort the duckling
can't
oh
poor duckling
can't even quack
is it a little duckling
what's that duckling's name
oh yes Motorcycle_Chicken
I've heard of Motorcycle_Chicken
what are you gonna do
is there a veterinarian in this town
does this town have a veterinarian's office
or an animal hospital
oh
oh what do you think a duckling might have swallowed
other than grain
um
something really small other than grain
do you need to use the potty
I'll go with you
and we can take Sleepy Bear and show him how to use the potty
what could a duckling swallow
a duckling could swallow a key
that is
that someone left on the ground
or a duckling could swallow a coin
oh
is it stuck in the duckling's throat
oh
what do you think we should do
it turned out I was his mommy
okay
okay
by the way uh let's see
the new Sleepy Bear could be in the bathroom or in the
living room
should we check
oh he's right there
right in the hallway
yes I'm the person behind the counter
oh uh
what kind of store is this Naima
oh this is the toy store
yes we're open now and we do have some toys that little bears might like
uh let me
let me uh take out a few things I could show you and you can decide if you think your little bear would like them
we have some cups which are very nice for stacking and putting together
like that
that's good for a little toddler or a big toddler even
and another nice toy for a child is a watering can
in fact my little girl has several watering cans at home
um my little girl has a green one just like this and she also has one in the shape of an elephant
so I I would recommend that as a very nice present to give your child
let's see there's something called a Magna_Doodle
and you can draw on it and you can write words on it
like
what's your child's name
oh I think I will do that
Sleepy Bear s l e
e
p y Sleepy Bear
and then bear is his other part of his name
uh b
e
a
r
there I spelled his name
wouldja like to show this to him
bear
this part says Sleepy Bear
and this part says Sleepy Bear
yes
that's a very good question
well
doodling means to write or draw a lot of different things
some of them can be words but usually just little drawings
doodle means to draw really
okay
xxx xxx
ah I'll beep it for you yes
beep
that's uh going to be five dollars
the cups are a dollar each
so that makes five
six
seven dollars is what you owe me
are you buying the watering can too
wouldjou like a little help with that
is this the toy store that
what were you asking me
oh it looks like you're buying two cups that are a dollar each
and you're also buying the Magna_Doodle which is five dollars
so that's seven dollars that you owe me
five
six
seven
do you have seven dollars
okay
mm okay
oh I think those are mostly one hundred aren't they
oh do you think you have seven in there
how many do you have
