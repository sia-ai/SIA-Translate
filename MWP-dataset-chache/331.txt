do you know what happens when they fight
they're really loud
it's too loud I'm trying to like watch tv and I'm trying to read and they're just too loud when they fight what would you suggest
food you think that if they're not so hungry then they may not fight so much
okay thank you that was helpful okay
ring ring ring

well I have_to tell you one of them the pterodactyl I think he's very sick
he's just very bloody you see him

oh alright
I was thinking we should tell Leslie about the things we've been doing since we saw her
I don't know if she knows that one place we went where there were tons of very big
waterfalls
do you wanna tell her what we did there
it was very big remember how surprised we were
how did we get around when we were there
a hiking trail that's right it was totally cool weren't we totally surprised
oh my gosh though she does not know what we saw there what was that big big big long thing that we saw there
it was a snake it was seriously how big would you say that snake was
that's right it was like twelve feet long probably more it was giant it was this giant snake we couldn't believe it was just living out there wasn't it giant
do you remember did the people like it who were around us did they like that snake
how did you feel about it
what
happy did you wanna take it home
that giant of a snake
I don't think we'd have anything to keep it in
you actually do have a snake pet though since we've been here how did you get a real little snake for our house for a while
Daddy catched one yeah
where did he catch it
mhm at our land he went and caught it and then what did you guys do
you screamed
I thought you liked that snake
remember you guys were trying to feed it
what'd you try to feed it
two snails and one worm but
you think he ate them
he ate part of the worm didn't he
that's gross I don't really like the snake
no I really don't well he was cute but I don't like that they have_to eat that they're meat eaters and they eat like live things it seems gross
you and Daddy did something else this weekend too that was super fun on Saturday do you remember where Daddy took you on where
a ride park yeah right
wasn't trying to think about oh she doesn't know about how you won
how you won some stuff
how'd you win the how'd you do the ball game
mhm you get a prize
so if you got the net and you catch the ball with the net right
so and how did you win the other little things like the parachute guy
picking up five ducks what were the ducks
what were they in
oh you just pick them up and see if you're the winner is that how it went
five ducks and then you won a whole bunch of little toys like a little harmonica
yes you did I know you totally did
so we've been really we've done tons of stuff we went hiking a bunch of times and we hm I'm trying to think about another thing you did that you told me about that was very interesting do you want to tell the story about that girl at your school and the cheese
okay
you can't tell yet okay how about if I count to ten and maybe you tell
fourteen okay
okay let's hear the story
you don't remember the story you told me the same story yesterday about her at school
about the cheese
do you remember the story do you want to talk about something else you don't have_to talk about the cheese story if you don't want
hm I'm trying to think of what else we've done since you were here
well there was one time we went hiking and we found something that was very tasty and you ate them all what were those
yup we kept finding blackberries and Matty kept eating them and Mommy and Daddy kept picking them right and who kept eating them
yeah
you want to eat that kind you ready for the next stick
alrighty well what about if you don't want to tell the cheese story what about something else that's going on at your school
do you wanna explain to her about the sticks we won't say anything about the yellow stick but how does the stick thing work
is it like this
oh what is it what is the yellow stick
and then
yeah what happens if you do a great job that day what do you get
mhm what happens if you get stars through the whole week like the whole week or something what do you get
mhm where do the prizes come from
mhm and does she choose it for you
or someone else who ever gets the prize gets to choose their own
doesn't that take a long time
now you had your eye on some particular toy what was that that you wanted to get
but if you see it when you get to choose from the jar that would be good new right
you already got_to do that what did you pick
remember what you chose
there's some what
that's okay you can talk about the candy that's fine
there's a couple of different colors in there right
we didn't even start the grape one yet right
so what did you do when James came over yesterday
you mean when we all went to Sullivan's
oh yeah we all went to Sullivan's that's true
but what did you do when James was at our house
I dunno you guys were doing like a marching band for a little while right
a music band
after we stopped then you did a music band
what is that that Daddy fixed with the batteries
there's lots_of stuff at our house that's like that
oh I remember you're talking about your tape recorder
Daddy put new batteries in it and now it works right
I see so you had a music band and you were using that
and then there was something that happened with the money what was the deal with the money
what was James trying to do with the money
he was trying to put in there and you were very angry at him
yeah why did you think he wanted to put it in there
and where did you want the money to be
out of there
I remember that was right before we were getting ready to go
so then we went to Sullivan's and that was cool right
except you guys kept trying to take that ketchup
what were you gonna do with that ketchup there
yeah I was a little worried
yes and the ketchup would go everywhere
that would not have been so good
hey you got something in your hair last week do you remember at school
sugar
on b week yeah last week was b week
how come you got sugar in your hair last week
you were the fastest on in your class in gym uhhuh and then
into the water pit
and then
well why did you want sugar in your hair instead of a toy
you always like toys
oh how did it feel
that was so funny though because I came home remember and I was like your hair is so sticky whatcha got in your hair
and it was
yeah
should we put this in your hair it's kind of like sugar
no no no don't really I'm just joking
if we were outside maybe but in here you've already gotten some stuff in Doctor Weist's lab
maybe afterwards we'll get like a paper towel what do you think of that
we'll wipe the floor up
you know what your mouth is totally blue you would not believe it
we did something I was thinking about running we went to the track the other day remember
what did we do at the track
your what you brought this here to put it in my hair
you brought what to the track
no that wouldn't have been a good idea for you to have candy there right
that stuff smells really really really really gross
I use to like the grape one that one's weird it's like a raspberry apple
that seems a little strange
do you wanna color
oh_my_goodness put that back down
what do you think about the Hulk hm
you know you're kinda turning into the Hulk because you know what
your teeth and your tongue are totally green just like this guy is totally green
oh_my_goodness that's a very strong guy
here's a maze let's see here
wow
her does have very big feet it's kinda odd isn't it and strange
look at all those muscles would you want to look like that
when you get older are you gonna be the Incredible Hulk
for Christmas
what a time that we dress up for certain things
dress up in costumes
no do you know what part of the year it is when we dress up in costumes
and we say trick or treat
yes Halloween
do you know what you're gonna be for Halloween this year
I dunno what do you think you wanna be
this guy the Hulk
I dunno about that
oh_my_goodness you wanna be a scary guy
you're gonna scare all the people when you go to their houses
you guess not huh
now a dinosaur costume would be cool
what were you last year do you remember
a pee pee head I don't remember that
you were Elmo when you were two
you were Elmo when you were two and then last year you were a
you don't remember
fireman
oh yeah a fireman
well we'll have_to look around and think about it you know what would it be cool to be for Halloween
oh the cherry one
no that's cherry
lick a stick
crunch a stick that's what you like to do
now what is Roman doing in the afternoons that on Thursday you find very interesting
after we picked him up and took him somewhere
what is he doing that you'd like to do
I'm not quite sure do you remember the name of it
no
so do you wanna color or no
what
you don't wanna put it away
should we talk about gymnastics what Roman does
what are you doing in gymnastics remember
you seemed interested in doing it you're not very interested in doing it still
into a blocky thing
oh like a trampoline kinda
is it like a big foam pit
is that what he jumped into a big pit
what's down in the pit snakes
dinosaurs
now that would be interesting if there was a bunch of dinosaurs in the pit
well we've been talking about whether Matty might do gymnastics
could you please pick that up go ahead
it's still in there I'll hold your stuff go ahead
so Matty might do gymnastics maybe
what was I worried about with you doing gymnastics though remember
what wasn't I sure about
because what
because you might play with Roman yeah
what would you and Roman do potentially
what's that
hold each other's hands and go around in a circle and are you supposed to do that
so what do you wanna do
we did the dinosaur game we've been mostly talking what else do you wanna do
I wonder you know what I'm thinking though
I'm worried a little bit that your hands are sticky and you're gonna get everything super sticky
I dunno maybe the candy wasn't such a good idea
so what are these Boo
I know I remember these we haven't used these in a while
we never really do much with them right
we could though we could like pretend that they're like a family or something
help I just fell off a chair
oh no this one he won't fall off a chair will he
he won't fall off the chair
yeah it looks like he's okay
look there's twins exactly twins
one's like a dad and one's like a grandpa
here's one like a grandma
xxx now it's this one
what is it what do you think
I dunno
it looks like a big donut
I really don't know maybe it's a pot with rice or something in it or potatoes
you have a new pet though
oh yes
do you wanna talk about your new pet
you
me no
I'm not the one who was there when you got it
what did you get
uh I get uh uh
you know what it is
a caterpillar
caterpillars
just one
what are you gonna do with a caterpillar
let it grow up to be a butterfly and then let it go
what's it gonna do while it's a caterpillar
uh turns itself into a cocoon
mhm it's gonna grow its cocoon that's right and then it's gonna turn into a butterfly
what does a caterpillar look like
uh it has um it's furry kinda and you never see it's eyes
what colors
it can be all different colors
do you remember I think it's mostly brown or black or orange
it's very cute
do you remember what did you name it
oh yeah Catty the caterpillar
Catty it kinda looks like a cat because it's furry so that's not a bad name for it
how about Catty the caterpillar
Catty the caterpillar
okay that sounds good
whoa are we gonna clean up all these things
yes or no
did you tell Leslie about today when you did a great job of cleaning up and what you got for it
at the play+ground you mean
yeah
I got_to at school today I got_to be the line leader
why
because I did such a good job cleaning up
mhm so you got_to be line leader and that was pretty cool
so I'm trying to think of stuff we've been doing since we saw Leslie
she doesn't know about when we went ice skating
uhuh
yeah how did that go
good great
what were you able to do all by yourself
skate
he was able to skate by himself
you can stand up and kind of go for a little ways right
that was so fun
did you start gymnastics
yeah you like it
what did you do in gymnastics last week I wasn't there you went with Ingrid remember
what did you end up doing there
we jumped into a big blocky pit
you jumped into a big blocky pit and what else
what else did you do
I saw you a little bit at the end you were jumping on something
you were jumping on the trampoline at the end I saw that
so what did we tell you what the rules were in terms of Roman what was the rule
not to play with Roman
when
at gymnastics
uhhuh and what happens if you play with Roman
uh I can't stay there and I can't go there anymore
yeah so what did you and Roman do then to make sure that didn't happen
uh I dunno
well did you tell Roman ahead of time did you say Roman I can't play with you
yeah
yeah
do you wanna tell about the sad thing that happened with Roman when we went to the park what Roman said and what you did and all that stuff
do you wanna talk about that
do you remember what happened at the park last week
yeah
how about do you wanna talk about when you and Daddy went on a mountain bike at the big big big Allegheny state park
no
whatcha doing there
what are you making
a big block I'm making a big tall block
a block huh
you know what
what
want me to tell you something funny
sure
this is a refrigerator you put books in the refrigerator
that's okay
oh it's okay for sure
they'll just get cold it's no big deal
here's the next one there's the next one that can go up
no that doesn't have_to be there because that's a square this is a rectangle right here
oh_my_goodness it has gold dust on it
the source of the gold dust you found it
you got some gold stuff on the sides of the books it's coming off
some of these are kinda old I think
so that one's a rectangle and this is a square so it's not fitting in is that the problem
mhm
they got smaller ones
I know
is this gonna be there forever
sure
I was thinking about something that was so funny that happened with your pumpkin that you carved
yeah
what happened xxx
is that gold
is that gold
let me see did you get it all over your face
so what happened to your pumpkin that was so funny
what
I said not gonna tell
not gonna tell you don't wanna tell the story about your pumpkin
too disgusting
too disgusting it was disgusting I know
so tell it
you want me to tell that story
okay I start telling it and you finish it okay
no
I'm gonna tell the whole story
yes
okay
James and Bailey carved pumpkins and we carved ours and left our in the house because we were decorating the house inside right
but then what happened to the pumpkin
we brought it outside and it uh a few days and after that uh totally disgusting
you want me to tell because it's such a disgusting story
well it just got very old remember how I said hey Matty remember you pushed it you said yeah it's falling apart and you put your hand in went in a little and then there was a big hole in is it was gross
you know what I didn't actually see what happened
what did Daddy do with the pumpkin
he stucked his hand in it he stucked his hand in it
he sticks his hand in it he did
mhm
I thought he used a shovel to pick it up
he tried that at first but he his hands went into it he couldn't he couldn't
he couldn't really pick it up right
so then what did he do
he used a shovel
and then he put it in the garden right
mhm
and mushed it all up
yeah
that's so gross
Mommy
yeah
which dinosaurs do you want
which dinosaurs do I want
you can have everything
I don't really want all these things I just want him the little triceratops
no
I gotta buy everything
mhm if you buy everything you can come here any day you want
if I buy all of them I can come here any day I want
yeah
can I buy them all and then return the ones I don't like
or do I gotta keep them all forever
you gotta keep them all forever
I don't think I want any of them
but you can have all of them
but I'm no sure I want them all
what if I want to buy horses today
no only dinosaurs for sale
only dinosaurs and if you don't have as much buy something else and it's one dollar
it's one dollar for all of this or for each dinosaur
all of them
it only costs a dollar for all this stuff huh
one dollar
you know what I'm worried about
what
why I'm not sure I want them all
what
I'm afraid that they're gonna fight see we have meat eaters and we have plant eaters they're gonna fight
but no they're not watch this
that's not fighting
are you okay little guy
he's not fighting
he's not
he hit him with his tail
but he only hits the meat eaters though
hm
but he only hits the meat eaters though
he only hits the meat eaters though
so I don't need to be worried
mhm
I dunno what if they're too loud
during the night they sleep
during the night they sleep
what if they're loud during the day
rarr
aren't my neighbors all going to be scared
no
well hm I'm not really convinced
why do these make good pets

oh_my_goodness so this whole group was fighting
but not these two
not the brontosaurus or the pterodactyl huh they were doing a great job
mhm
these guys were fighting I dunno
I'm starting to think that maybe I shouldn't keep them all
xxx you should
they're you're sure
yeah
did anybody get injured
mm nope
they just were fighting
look at his mouth
oh my god his mouth is so bloody
no it's not
oh okay
what's he doing there then
nothing that's just the way they made him
okay so there's nothing wrong with his mouth
no
okay well let's see we're gonna have a talking to them
I'm gonna have a talk with them about not fighting okay
maybe we should tell them all the rules of the house
okay so what are the rules here
what would you say would be good rules for the house
um no fighting and also no wrestling
okay no fighting no wrestling uhhuh
also keep your hands keep your hands and feet to yourself
okay keep their hands and feet to themselves that sounds good
are you guys listening
these are good rules anything else
okay so everybody should have their own space everybody should spread out and don't let your hands or feet touch anybody else
or their mouths
or their mouths that's true we don't want anyone biting anybody else right
how about are they allowed to say mean things to each other
oh yeah
they are
mhm
oh no I don't want them to have a lot of mean words and arguments
I think that's another rule we should say no mean words
no mean words or arguments
okay I hope this works
what happens if they do a great job what do they get
um when the dinosaurs do a great great great job they'll get three things
three things they can choose whatever they feel like kinda like the prize draw
yeah
yeah cool
no they can choose three things
wow that's a pretty good deal
how long do they gotta do a good job for
uh one minute
one minute okay
so hopefully they can do it that long right
and one minutes up
they get to choose their prizes now
mhm
what if they fight over who gets what prize
they wont because I'm gonna bring one up at a time
okay they each get to pick their favorites
he gets he did a great job so he gets he wants to pick this boy and um one book and he also gets to choose this
okay what's he gonna do with the boy
uh let's just get him something else
I just was afraid he was gonna eat the boy
is he gonna eat the boy
no
okay because he can have the boy if they're just gonna be friends
I was just worried he might want to want the boy
okay there
so what's he gonna choose he's gonna take the chalkboard
chalk
do you know what this is called
a I like I'm pretending I like this and I want it and I'm gonna give him the toaster
so he gets the toaster the book and do you know what this is called
what
you remember you've used these
rolling pin
okay so he gets his prizes so he's gonna come over here and he gets to play with those things
okay so who's the next who gets to come up and choose
uh stegosaurus and the long neck
because they both did a pretty good job huh
they're not gonna fight because I gotta put stegosaurus back because he might fight over the things
so they gotta come really one at a time
mhm
and we know these two don't fight so they can come up together right
I never seen them fight
you've never seen them fight
they're all gonna get one one this one's gonna get a toaster too and this to shake over his head and a little piece of toast and butter

well I was wondering if this one needs to have a friend
I think they look like they could be friends together they're not too different in size I'll take that one
because I bought the other one this guy's free
hey hey I do not like that
did you jump on my back
I'm sorry I thought you would like that
look they're very similar look this one is green with a little yellow and this I yellow with a little green interesting huh
mhm
mhm
they're a little different but they do have some of the same colors
how cool
now they are good friends except look wait a minute
that's not nice that is not nice
look at that he does not seem happy that the darker one was putting him in his mouth
oh_my_goodness is he telling him no
is he trying to protect his baby
it's not his baby it's just a little one
so oh_my_goodness it's a funny one isn't it
I hope nothing happens to him
so before I take my dinosaurs home do you wanna tell Leslie about Halloween
what did you dress up like
an astronaut
well who did you go trick or treating with
how many James were there
ten James
what was James dressed up as
well Leslie hasn't been trick or treating in a long time so tell me how you actually go trick or treating
and then
what do you do once they give you the candy
thank you and then you get to take the candy home right
so you got a bunch of candy and then the next day I think it was there was a huge parade right
what happened with the parade
it got canceled
I don't think so I saw kids go through in the parade
so what was interesting about the parade what did you end up getting that was totally cool
you forgot alright I'll tell her because actually it's really mine
what is it
it's yours
candy they got all kinds of crazy candy at the parade Roman and Matty did
tell me what else you did that was interesting you've gone trick or treating hm
oh_my_goodness xxx right all the money
I'm trying to think of what else you have been doing oh you went to a movie
you went to go see what movie on Sunday
right and what happens in Brother Bear
aren't there some people and a bear too
mhm the person turns into a bear okay and then
he finds this littler bear
he finds a little bear where's the bear's mommy
in heaven how come
they killed his mom
so then what does the person who was turned into the bear do
take care of him that's good
it sounds like a good movie
all of them for free
alright we'll put these in there too
everybody can go together
can I have some food for them too
they eat these don't they
they don't eat sheep
I think they'd want to eat sheep and cows and pigs
alright so I only really had to pay one dollar for just the one and all the rest are free
how about the food don't I have_to pay for the food
zero dollars
you're ringing them all up all together though how much is it gonna cost
zero dollars each ringing them up
but each one only costs like zero cents right
you know another thing you did since we last saw Leslie was you went to when your school had the haunted house
did you go inside the haunted house
no what did you do there
well what games
basket stink ball I don't think so I did not remember that game basket stink ball
how do you play basket stink ball
uhhuh and then what happens
you what
you forget so really when you win isn't it the case that you get a prize or something like that
that would be good
who
oh they're gonna say cheese are they really getting their picture taken
they're all gonna say cheese that's really cute
um um excuse me
excuse me I think they have_to go to the bathroom
what should I do with them
where do they tend to go to the bathroom
right on one of the animals like on one of these animals
can't I train them to go outside or use a toilet
here which of these can I train to use the toilet
any of them
alright I'll see I'm gonna go home now and see how it goes okay
thank you so much
are you calling me
oh_my_goodness I forgot my food
can I leave the animals here alone or is it dangerous
I need to bring them all back with me in the car
I'll just leave them here quick I'll just drive my car quick and pick up the food
the basket costs a dollar
oh okay here you go
oh_my_goodness I never really met anybody at a store who ate money
don't you need the money to buy stuff for your store
I'm having some real real problems with the pets you gave me
well I just don't know which ones are meat eaters and which one's are plant eaters
Friday they're gonna be hungry before then
I dunno they got all mixed up when I was taking them here
I really don't know which ones are plant eaters and which ones are the meat eaters
oh_my_goodness how do I know
uhhuh I think so it might be a duckbill
I think those are just to protect itself
it's up what do you think raptor
okay so he goes in the which section
oh_my_goodness he's in his own house
okay
uh huh
sliding down so fast
so alright so I already got a couple ones
which one is this plant eater right
oh are these all plant eaters that are left
okay
okay all the meat eaters go there okay
and all the plant eaters go here
hm
really are you gonna try it out
oh no
how could you get it to stay there do you think
well think what helps fasten stuff or keep things that are stuck to other stuff
nails you could nail him up sure
what else
sure you do I have let me see let me see your hands
you totally have nails
fingernails
no what
that's something else
oh that's the one we've ran out of
how about just magic can't we just use magic to connect it
well why not
so magic is just for fairy tales and stories I see
and shows there's been a show you've been watching nearly everyday
it matches your socks
oh yeah you've totally been watching Sponge Bob
we got some d_v_ds that each have like ten episodes right Boo
it's kind of overwhelming it's a lot of Sponge Bobs
I don't really like Sponge Bob do you know why
why don't I think Sponge Bob Boo
he's cool
no no no
he's rude
yeah why do you like Sponge Bob so much
no no no
I know really who your favorite person is on the Sponge Bob show
Squidworth
why
because he's a bad guy
I think Squidworth is just really kinda I dunno he's in a bad mood like everyday right
so anyway I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing since we came here last time
yes dear
ah oh_my_goodness
imagine if you were inside there and all of a sudden I came through the window
here I'll pretend that I'm asleep and then you pretend
what is that anyway what's the name of that creature
a lizard okay let's say I'm sleeping here
ah ah it's the attack of the lizards ah
man that would be scary wouldn't it if the lizard came through the window
yeah
what do you think about her hair
oh_my_goodness why are xxx
so I have a question you were telling me about his one kid at your school what's his name
the one who always gets the yellow sticks
yeah how did he do today
did he get any yellow sticks
how about you did you
so with Dawson what does he do usually that makes him get a yellow stick
like what did he do
well tell me one of those storybooks xxx

you could have hit someone now it's missing
I don't want to see you do that anymore okay
so tell Leslie about how we ended up with your shoes yesterday where did we go shopping
so how did we end up with those shoes yesterday
what
well where did we buy them and how many stores did we go to
uhoh oh_my_goodness what happened to the farm
oh_my_goodness I think the bad lizards attacked the people and the animals on the farm
they'd probably be pretty scared if all a sudden this giant giant lizard came to their town
what ever you knock over you gotta clean up okay
just so you know
well if you make a big mess you gotta clean it up
just remember you xxx you gotta help clean up if you make a mess okay
so it reminds me seeing all these animals reminds of when you and I went to the zoo
what was different about the zoo when we went last time
think about it what was different what was hanging everywhere
yeah why were there spiders at the zoo
mm hm
you were the what
the mayor the one who's in charge of the town
oh that's pretty interesting
now he's totally trapped for now right
oh he's trapped
I think this is a pretty big mess
ah that's a giant mess this crocodile totally wrecked the whole barnyard
oh_my_goodness
