I know that's what they're in there for
yeah
that's so you can slide down and get your hair rinsed
most of all what Nomi
oh okay
okay Nomi
we've got everything working
what are you doing with the sponge
I don't think you'd better do that Nomi because you splash it over
no no no no
we can't have any splashing out_of the tub because that man's coming to put the tile on the floor and he can't work on a wet floor
don't drop it please
oh Nomi whoops
oh don't
oh boy
because you're getting all that stuff into the tub
well because that's not where it belongs
if it's in the tub now it's gonna get in your hair later on
let me see if I can clear some of that out
are you warm enough in there Naomi
well I guess there's nothing you can do about that
Naomi tell me about the summer again
I'd like to hear what your
well what you want to do in the summer
why not
what sorts of things don't you like to do
mhm
I thought that you liked it last summer
oh
oh and why did your teacher yell at you
oh
mhm
what happened when your teachers yelled at you
you didn't pay any attention to them
Naomi don't splash
you just kept right on walking slowly up the hill
you walked slowlyer
it's on
you can speak right now
we've been speaking into it all this time
oh no you can't hold it Naomi
not when you're in the tub
that's dangerous
that can Naomi for the same reason Naomi that you can't play with plugs
didn't you hear it before when we played it back
okay
well I'm going to put some more hot water in the tub and we'll play it back
and you can listen to your voice while the hot water runs into the tub
okay
I've put the tape+recorder on again
Nomi tell me what happened on the way home today when you were riding in the car with Jacqueline and there was somebody on a bicycle
do you remember how you said that
when you were in the car
I think in the car she had said
if we were we would have
can you finish it
we would have
oh somebody's at the door
you talk into the tape+recorder for a minute while I get the door
Nomi's in the tub
mhm
how did you get that scratch
never did hurt very much did it
you want what
well that was all there was Nomi
well I'm afraid we've erased that part now
well there's no way of getting that any more because we're tape recording over it
what else would you like to talk about
do you want to tell me another story
make up another story
it'd be nice
tell me a story Nomi
okay
sure
now you have_to speak clearly Naomi
Nomi remember the tape+recorder has trouble understanding so you have_to speak clearly for the tape+recorder
no it listens
it just listens
sometimes it talks
I guess when it plays back it talks doesn't it
and what about Naomi
oh well maybe she's with the pineapple
where is she
I don't see her
and who are you pointing to
don't pick at those Nomi please
wallpaper fell off the pillow
put meatballs on them
and did what
even on the toilet+paper
Nomi it'd be good if you came down to this side of the tub where the microphone is
it had a funny shaped body
oh for a poo+poo
and it lived happily ever after
are you ready to get you hair washed now
we'll turn this off while you get your hair washed
what do you want to say now
okay one more story and then you come out_of the tub
mhm
can I throw this out Naomi
I'm not understanding any of this either if you're having trouble transcribing
remember Nomi um if you wanna record you have_to just talk would be better because it's awfully hard to understand
it doesn't help that she's got a bit of a head cold
Nomi why don't you tell us tell us what you're doing with the frog
why is it hopping
where is it going
it doesn't know where
I see
she's got the frog's leg through the fish eye
Naomi I'd like you to say some to say a sentence
first the way you would say it and then the way some other people would say the same thing
let's say how about
it's time for a bath tonight
you say that just the way you would say it
okay now say it the way Jacqueline would say it
say it the way I would say it
how would a baby say it
how would a boy say it
how would a girl say it
how would a man say it
how would a woman say it
okay Nomi in two minutes you'll come out_of the tub
I guess that was the water running out_of it
if fish get out_of the water
yes
Naomi time now to come out_of the tub
if you want dessert and time to play upstairs you have_to come out now
you can just leave the water in there and it'll come out
when frogs get in the water Nomi they get water inside them
we'll just get you dressed
uhhuh
well you could pretend it's a cowboy vest
I don't know whether it was meant to be actually a cowboy vest but you could say it was a cowboy vest
yeah
well does that look better
wow I bet it doesn't even hurt any more does it
oh it looks much better
it really does
you're really getting well
okay let's get your socks on
you scratch it with your finger
well if you scratched it that hard it would make another scratch wouldn't it
then you'd start all over again
it'd be hard to scratch it as hard as that metal thing wouldn't it
that metal thing really scratched it hard
yeah that must have really hurt
no she didn't mean to
do you xxx this morning
what is that honey you're doing
hm
no not for now
we're getting dressed now
yeah well let's not use that now Nomi
what
alright go quickly
xxx to open the door
yesterday on the way home in the car she said as we went past a bicyclist
we might have hit him if we were still behind him
okay what commercial was it
oh the Salvation Army commercial
the one about baby care
yeah that's a nice commercial
tells you all the nice things the Salvation Army does
lunch's made
made
hey neat Daddy made your lunch Nomi
because you're going to wear this under this
this goes over see
yeah this is
the whole thing is a little small for you
put the pants on
tuck the orange shirt in honey
yeah would you
okay let's tuck the orange shirt in
what
why did he say that
oh and he was afraid
because he was way up in the sky
so then what happened
nothing
oh
wow
okay
I'll get your hair brushed and then you can play in here until we're ready to go okay
what do you want
yeah well we can tape
you can taperecord honey
but you'll have_to play in here where the tape+recorder is if you want to taperecord
okay
well I have_to go get dressed
but I'll brush your hair first and then put your shoes on
yeah
don't hold the microphone
oh I'll show you in a minute
did you hurt yourself honey
oh on the metal in this bed again
yes my_goodness
well it is kind of sad yeah with the metal
what I try to do usually is fix the mattress so the metal's not sticking out quite so much
is it nice having a rug in nursery school
the rug
that make it nicer sitting over there
nicer crawling place
and kind of quieter too
what why not get the shoe on first and then I'll watch you
I like to finish doing something when I start it
it's always a good idea
finish one thing
what you going to do
gonna crawl
oh wowie
hopping on one foot
oh that does look hard
let me see if I can do it
oh yeah oh it's too hard
tricky
oh you've really got_to be able to balance awhile doncha
whoops
but just even to be able to hop on one holding one foot like that is really good
okay
I think he's back getting dressed
you want to hold the microphone
okay you can hold it just try not to move around too much
now you want to say something special into it
is that what you did the other day at school when you recorded
did you hold the microphone
or was the microphone on the table
or did Louise hold the microphone
oh
did it make you feel shy to have the microphone in front of your face
did it make you shy to have Louise there
no oh that's good
because you'd met Louise before huh
remember meeting Louise at Hillel
you don't
the night we went to the children's service at Hillel
remember the person who sat next_to me honey
that was Louise
don't you remember that
yes I thought you knew her from before
what honey
um that's um something about I guess it turns the microphone off if you turn this off
it's a way of turning it off
um I guess I should put some No_More_Tangles on your hair shouldn't I
you washed it last night
oh well
yeah I know
you're supposed to talk while you've got it there you know
what
the wallpaper piece of wallpaper
mhm
you said you wanted that one
what else did the children do with them whoops
mhm
uhuh did anybody do cut+outs
uhuh
uhuh and I saw it
mhm
different colors
yeah as_soon_as I get your hair done
well I think it won't record if you don't
we don't want to have one side of your hair with No_More_Tangles and the other side not have because then you'd have one tangles side and that would be silly wouldn't it
and we'd keep wondering hm why is one side of your hair all tangled and the other side nice and smooth
you're gonna what
okay
what are they xxx
okay wanna listen to what it sounds like now
okay there's just a little more tape left on Nomi not too much so you can tape what's left okay
okay
I don't want you to push any buttons
I'll come back later
don't push button okay
Nomi you didn't have your vitamins this morning did you
let's just put this over here
okay
do you want me to open them or do you want to take them out
okay
yeah
you need to push a button
want to turn it off now
what do you wanna do
listen
alright there's just a tiny bit left on here not very much and then the tape will be over
I'm gonna put the bunnies up here okay
I know
I'm just waiting
I'm not really watching
I'm just waiting for the tape to be over
do you feel inhibited when I'm here
this is continuing from the other side
this is February seven and Nomi wants to finish her sentence
okay now
honey
you don't have_to hold the microphone actually that close to your mouth
hold a little further away and we'll just hang the microphone over the side here and you can play with your animals and stuff and still record
would you like to do that
hm
okay
you do whatever you want just don't push any buttons
okay and try not to drop the microphone
how's everything in here going honey
please don't hold the microphone right up to your mouth honey
if it gets wet inside there it's very bad for it honey
so don't put it on your mouth
hold it yeah about that distance away from you is fine
yeah but it actually doesn't even need to be held honey
it could just be
you can have it just hanging off the chair and then you have both of your hands free to play and you'd still be talking into the microphone
don't use the microphone like that honey your lips are on the microphone
remember to hold it away
okay
the reason is it doesn't record well and it ruins the microphone
I'll come in just a second honey
Louise
oh and what are you going to do with that one
yeah that's alright honey
I saw something green under there
oh that's a pear tree
uhhuh
what are the cat and dog saying to each_other
it's going down behind the earth
so it is
what's going to happen to the night then
