friends are just perfect for all kinds of things
like walking or talking or swinging on swings
and for watching tv a friend is the best
for cheering cartoons with and booing the rest

for playing some catch or just having fun with
they're running aren't they
yeah
you can sing and shout until your tonsils wear out
because that's what having a friend's all about
a friend is a buddy who'll come to your aid
when he thinks you need help or you might be afraid
a friend is a partner who'll stand back to back
to protect you from bullies or a monster attack
with a friend you can do what you most like to do
you can have your own hideouts in dark secret places
or spend the whole day having caterpillar races
what's that
xxx can I see
looks like it came out of a puzzle or something
little pink circle
whoopsie sorry
a little pink circle
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
oh I missed a page
sorry or just drawing pictures of each other's faces
you can laugh you can cry you can watch cars go by
you can have a great time and not even try
a friend is a person who likes to be there
because you two make a wonderful pair
and when all's said and done a natural end is
a friend is a friend that's what a friend is
