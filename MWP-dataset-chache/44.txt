I asked Ross if he knew what specify meant
I said he had to specify what he wanted for dessert
and he said
to say what you want
he said to say exactly right
oh for I mean for for for a snack for a bed time snack
and then I said do you know what what precisely means
what's the difference between precisely and exactly
you said there's no difference right
do you think there's a little bit of difference between those two words
let's think about it
precisely
is not quite as exact as exactly
exact means absolutely perfect
precisely could just be a little bit off
it means you tried very hard but you might have missed it just a little
whatever you it was you were doing
oh maybe you were trying to figure out how big how big um
a toy how big a toy
how big a toy is
you bet it's hot
you bet your boody it's hot
that's cause they boil these things before they put them out
you bet your boodies
no the glass gets hotter than the plastic honey
because glass conducts heat
and plastic is an insulator
because it's not made of glass it's porcelain
no way
it's made of china
there's a difference
china is china and glass are both based on sand
they both come from sand but china has more lime in it
it makes it white
glass is pure sand
silica
do you know silica is a mineral it's an element
well bowls what kind of bowls
silica looks like mud
right
into a bowl
right
honey no that's mud
that's what they did that's how they make the that's how they make this
it's with a type of very pretty mud
that's made of metal
that's not mud
that's metal too
do you know how they make metal
I know you mean a
I know what you mean
I know exactly what you mean
you're talking about pottery
pottery is different than pottery is not the same thing as glass
you know how they make glass
they blow it with their with their lungs like a big balloon
they blow glass
they get it real hot then they get a tube and they and the glass blows up
a big tube
why what's wrong with a tube
well you guys had a tube down your tummy once remember that
remember that
why
well what about pumping out tummies
you can't take it huh
I understand
I understand
well I'll try to be careful and I won't say anything about tubes
or pumping out tummies
or taking people's eyeballs out
I won't say anything about any of those horrible things okay
I was just gonna tell you what it was I wasn't gonna talk about
oh you really don't like that hunhunh
I can understand that Ross
I mean any kid who's ever had his tummy pumped out like you
or who's ever heard about people having tubes
tubes in their ears
have you ever had a tube in your ear yourself
well you might
you're gonna listen
