you know we have seen quite a bit of Roman since we've seen Leslie
he came over for your birthday party
then we went hiking by their house
remember
what did you and Roman catch when you went hiking by their house by the creek
yes you caught some tadpoles
good news
what are tadpoles
fishies are you sure about that
actually they're not honey
what are they then
if they're not fish what are tadpoles
mhm they're baby frogs
they haven't turned into frogs yet
what else did we do at Roman and Sophie's house do you remember
besides going hiking
what did we celebrate
toes taking off
two toes
you took toes from people
I must have missed that part
I was thinking when we was jumping on the trampoline or something
did you like that
that was fun
and then you learned a new game too
remember the game where you had to throw the thing
what was that called
frisbee what
you were doing that right
throwing it against the wall
tree I wasn't sure well sometimes it was a tree sometimes it was a fence right
oh my thank you so much I have a new eyeball now
oh my gosh look at your eyeball now

show Leslie
do it and show Leslie
it looks disgusting
now were we going to set up the furniture
we started opening it do you want to do that more
okay how should we set this up
hm
bye bye baby
you know I was just reminded of a joke
remember we used to say where does Peter Pan cook his eggs
wasn't it in his peter pan
something like that I don't remember
I don't remember that joke we used to tell it all the time though
where do they take their boogies out
I don't know where
I don't know about that that's not really a joke Boo
that's just like a silly thing
you got some new band aids today

it's the web
it's Spider Man's web
and you're what
and you're Spider Man
I had no idea
you need that back
you want that
that's your very own web
hey I bet you Leslie doesn't know what's on the track
or underneath the track
worm balls
I don't think they are balls
tell her how you get to there
what part is that by
there's no eye balls up there where is it at
you did
is it in the middle of the track
it's like in the part where people jump over the xxx trees pit
if what
if Veve ever comes over
hey where's your web
okay
if Veve ever comes over you can show her okay
you can lift up this one part of the track
underneath it how many worms you say there are underneath there
ninety maybe
maybe ninety there is a lot
twenty maybe
twenty thirty
I think maybe thirty worms yeah
all in this one little mass
it's pretty gross
it's nice
disgusting
is that the word I used
yeah
my eyes are disgusting
inside of them
I see
oh yeah check it out
yuck that's nasty
nope
that's another little chest of drawers
and what about this
key key key
hey now she's sitting down
oh my gosh
yet another one
okay
oh careful
a sink with a head with no eyeballs
is that what happened to the sink
walked away from his house slipped and then nothing happened
so that was good
he didn't get hurt
that was ishy gushy
oh but I need it
I need some gum
you sure
woah yuck
what's in there
I'll pretend I'm her
let me out
is that what she'd say
I'm trying to think of what else we've been up to
we've been pretty busy this week
that's not a good toilet seat
how come
xxx let's see here
wake up everybody
we should do that at our house
you do
this
that's not a toilet
where
where it goes
ours probably looks like that too if you look inside of it
got_to take it out at home
in a few minutes
I know
so it's not really time to go home yet
I know something else we did since the last time we saw Leslie
remember last week we went to a place in Buffalo
where they had animals
what did we do at the zoo
we throwed snowballs
I don't remember that part
we did do something that was very interesting
what did we follow when we were up there
we followed something
you kept looking at it the whole time
here's Matty looking at it
okay here we go next
what were we following so we didn't miss anybody
the map exactly
what does a map tell us
where to go
where to punch
we didn't punch any animals
yes sure
we can go play store
I'll come
what do I wanna buy
well this looks good
it says it's milk
whoa milk doesn't come in a box
that is very strange
here's some chocolate milk
chocolate milk doesn't come in a box either
that's very strange
but I'll take those anyway
I'll try them
since I've chosen it you'll ring it up and put it there
okay
do you know what this is
chicken pie
I don't think I'd like that
this is jelly
jelly that don't look like jelly
what does this look like instead
not jelly but gel
yeah but they're saying it's jelly not jello
this is strawberry shortcake
hm strawberry shortcake mix might come in a box
but the strawberries wouldn't come in a box
I'm not sure about that
and here's a giant orange juice
it's much bigger than everything else
and that last thing I'd like some more of this
this is corn soup
how about this
I'm just gonna drink it in the store
is that okay
how come
what would happen if you just drank something in the store
well you'd have_to pay for it at least
there's nothing in it because I drank the whole thing
I still have_to pay for the container because I drank it right
do I want anything else
I'll have this piece of toast
and also this orange slice
is this an orange or a peach
what do you think
mystery fruit
I think that's it
ring me up too
how much do I cost
ten dollars
how much do I owe you in general
for all the stuff
I owe you fifty a hundred ten
a dollar ten is that how much it costs
a hundred dollars just for that
how about can I make a deal with you
how about fifty dollars
a hundred
a hundred and ninety dollars for that stuff
I can't buy it
I'll just leave it there in a pile good bye
are you gonna eat it instead
you're eating all that food
do you have a hundred and ninety dollars
that's a good question
number eight won't ring up let's see if the rest do
oh I know why
you've got too many numbers pushed so it won't let you push any more
are you still playing this game
no okay
you're saying that even on the tape recorder
you're jumping on the couch
aren't you worried you'll get in trouble
oh_my_goodness
what's doctor Weist going to say about that when he hears that
you're jumping on the couch
I would not do that
what's doctor Weist gonna say
oops
you don't think he would say anything
I don't know about that
we need to find something else to do
we're only going to be here about five more minutes
you got_to find something else to do
hm
play with me okay
well what would you like to play
mess up the building
you want to play tornado
okay
we got_to set it up first and then a tornado will come
so let's set up the house and then the tornado will come
okay come on I need your help
okay so this is the kid's room
should we make the kids sleep in here though
okay
okay
both of the kids can sleep in here okay
what else do you want in the kids room anything else
I know it looks like xxx
any other toys in there you want
a chalkboard and
do you want to just put it down
alrighty
do you think you can actually read those books
yes you can let me see the name of it
atlas of the world
this would have all kinds of maps in it
an atlas is a book that has a bunch of maps
so all the books go in the kids room right
it's called learning french
that would be helpful
do you want to speak french
you got the blackboard
this one's funny it's called Aunt Fanny's Cookbook
that's funny you wouldn't have a cookbook in your room probably
anyway if we're gonna have a tornado we're going to have_to hurry so
let's put all these in here okay
are there any more rooms you want to set up before the tornado comes
what does the tornado sound like
oh it sounds like it's grouchy
okay so the children are sleeping in their room with the books and the chalkboard
and then what happened
mama mama
you'll lock the house
okay
mama mama
it's okay
the tornado won't get you
oh Matty where are you
we're so worried the tornado will get you
where did you go
oh you're under there to close the door
is the tornado over
okay but
what's gonna happen
ah tornado the kids are screaming
ah don't take us away
what would you say
take care of the kids huh
put one in here
can't you put them in this little chest of drawer things
what are you doing
you're closing the house up with these things
how about this
why don't we pick up our stuff and then afterwards we'll do that right before we leave
okay
it's almost time to go and we got a lot of things that need to be picked up
okay so let's put these things away and then we'll do that
okay
the quicker you help the more time we'll have_to do bowling
so what are you gonna do when you go home tonight with Daddy
so what are you gonna do with Dad tonight
yes but you know what
I don't have_to stay late because I just give my test tonight
yes I'll be there before you guys go to bedtime
I thought maybe we'd go sow Daddy that waterfall the big one
it should still be light out when I get home
are you a scaredy egg
I'm not scared
do I seem scared
scared of what
I'm scared of myself
well that's pretty scared isn't it
I'm scared of myself that would be pretty scary
what did you say Boo
can I get your attention
can I what
can I get your bowling ready now
I think so
I think we can do that
alright bowling
how do you do bowling
you take one of the sticks and hit it down
you hit the thing down
wait wait I've never heard of that bowling
you want to do it that way pretending like we did the other time
alrighty
we'll do this quick and end up going soon
Daddy's going to want to know what you are doing and what you are up to
yeah he'll probably think we would be about
now how we got_to set these up Boo
could you please hand me those two
okay now the world's famous bowler
oh_my_goodness
that was pretty fast
okay one more time
two what
two more times
okay two more and then that will be it
oh my that made me nervous
okay now
one more time
world's famous bowler
hit them all over
hit them all over one more time
what do they call that when you get three strikes in a row
do you remember
no not a cupcake
do you know what it's called
a turkey
no I don't know why they call it a turkey
if you get three strikes in a row that's what it's called
what made you think of cupcake
okay last one
maybe what
okay you're thinking about cake huh
we got_to put this away and then we'll go
okay can I see it
I can help you with that
so she remembered you like Spider Man huh
she'd probably would think there was something funny about Spider Man and what you and Daddy set up in the living room last night
what did you set up
a tent
the tent
they set up a tent in the living room and they were sleeping in the tent
a big tent
how come your Daddy decided to set up the tent anyway
Daddy thought it was pretty cool yeah
so what do you want to do Boo
what's that look like to you
dinosaur yeah
do you want to talk about your trip
she does not know what you went in
what did you go in
to get to Grandma and Grandpa's house
oh you told her
yeah we talked about it
well I didn't get to hear about it
what did you do
you went in a big big plane about as huge as this building
wow that is a big plane
so what did you do when you were on the plane anyway
I don't think I know that
did you just sit there quietly or what did you do on the plane
you just sat there quietly
were you nervous at all going on the plane
that's good
what else did you do at Grandma and Grandpa's
they were both swimming places
so you went to a water park and a swimming pool
wow how big were the slides at the swimming place
or the water park
they were about as big as what
as big as this room
if I went on it my foot would touch the bottom of the water slide
that doesn't sound very big
I see the ones Cody went on were bigger than the ones you went on
it was as big as this building
how come you didn't go on that one
okay
I see you couldn't walk in the big people's water because it was too deep
so where Cody got off the water slide it was too deep for you
let's see
so that's cool you know what they call that
it's called a kick+stand
I don't know why
now the kick+stand's up
now the kick+stand's going to be down
well how about did you tell her about going to Ponderosa
what kind of animals do they have at the park where you went with Grandma and Grandpa
baby bunnies they were so tiny
what did you do with those bunnies
did you get to actually hold them
yeah
were they really soft
you even petted them
Daddy said you were even kissing them
is that right
you were kissing the little bunnies
what else did they have at that place
chickens don't peck your finger
maybe they were roosters
they didn't have the things that hang down like chickens do
they could have been roosters instead
so they had chickens there and horses
what about goats did they have goats
you're sure they had goats
it would even eat dog bones
no I didn't know
I wondered if they had goats because they are the ones that totally want all the food you have in your hand
and jump all on top of you almost right
did they have that did you guys do that
so then maybe they were sheep because sheep don't do that
and sheep do have horns too
that's pretty big
and their legs were that tall so
it sounds like maybe they were pretty big then
I'm trying to think what else you did that might have been interesting since we were last here
how about what did we do yesterday
remember you and I were somewhere kind of funny
do you remember where we went
we went to the mushroom park
what were we gonna do at the mushroom park
we were going to do what
the camera broke didn't it
it's so silly
when had we gotten that camera
the same day we were using it we got it
but there was something really strange about that camera anyway
do you remember what was weird about that camera
what did it come with
a helmet yeah
it came with a bike helmet
so it was a free camera that came with a bike helmet
and it was not good
what did you take pictures of at home before it broke
really you got a new magazine or you got a new camera
okay tell me
so it's almost like a leaf blower but it sucks up wood
something about your motorcycle I think
weren't you gonna say thank you for it
you're welcome
we were wondering something about why she had given it to you right
weren't you wondering if it was for your birthday or just for because you were a nice boy
I saw it and saw it was Spider Man and I thought of Matty
she thought you'd like it
she thought you'd totally think it was cool
we were looking at it in the bathroom it's very cool
it goes up everywhere almost like Spider Man does
so what did we do when we couldn't go hiking
when we couldn't take pictures what did we do instead
we went to the park and what else did we do
what did we do at the rock beach that was pretty cool
we were climbing the rocks
what did we do with some of the shale
we took some of it home
no we didn't
I don't think we did
that was at the beach the day before
yesterday we didn't take any shale home I don't think
what we did remember we went to the part that's all like falling apart into little pieces
and we were throwing it and hit the rock and explode
yup we did take that home you're right
we took the orange kind of rock home that is true
and then we did something afterwards because we got hot but we didn't want to swim in the lake
why don't we swim in that lake
dirty yeah
dirky
it was dirky water
it is kind of murky and dirty
so what did we do instead
play bowling you wanna play bowling
just tell me what we decided to do because we were hot from climbing
we didn't want to swim
he took a whole bucket and poured it all over his head
and then you were super cold right
and then you were shivering
and then we were talking about the funny thing where someone actually had a worm bath
what would a worm bath be like
how do you have a worm bath so that doctor Weist will know
say it on the tape recorder how you have a worm bath
the worms talk to each other
what do they say
I see
I see
that's what the worms say to each other
let's ride the motorcycle because we've rode one before
you have_to push those things down and then what does it do
I makes it stops right
what did you and Daddy get at the Home Depot today that was cool for you
a garden set
well what's part of the garden set
a rake and a shovel and a bucket
all those things
really
wow
so is it a kid's set
do you want to talk about going on our trip
where we're gonna go
we're going to be here next week but then we're going to be gone
where are we going do you remember
the ocean yeah
are we gonna see any of these
you hope not
you don't want to see any sharks
any great white sharks
what are we gonna see at the ocean probably
kick butt barracudas
really well that would be interesting
what did we see last time we were there
sharks
shark babies
so what do you want to do today
do you want to play with the cash register
what
oh the bowling set
yes I do remember
you want to do it that way again
now what are you really supposed to do when you do bowling
so you're really supposed to hit it with this pin huh
okay one more time and then we'll do something else
you can barely see through it how come
oh_my_goodness are you okay
I didn't know you were going to use you to knock them over
what
you were pretending you were a pin
you want to use the ball now
can we use the last pin then since you're going to do it with the ball
that did go pretty good
I just remembered something
we did not even mention what we found the other day that we brought home in the bucket
what did you find
a shell
how about I give you another hint
we got it at Leona Falls and it was creepy
what was it
a crayfish
I want to bowl again said the worms
you could be those worms talk right
so what did we do with the crayfish then
did we eat the crayfish
we didn't eat him for supper
that was a good way
I've never seen anybody do it that way
time to go home
how about a couple more minutes Boo
why are you getting hungry
what did you and Daddy have for lunch today
two noodles and a hotdog
only two noodles that's all
one kooky poop
did Daddy make you a new hotdog or did you eat the one I made you yesterday
he didn't know I made one did he
what are you talking about
I don't think we need to talk about this anymore
oh my gosh are you okay
you can't leave just yet
so Matty do you want to talk about all the different things you got today
wow
forty two things and they included these and what else
slinkies
what are slinkies supposed to do do you know
yup what color are the slinkies
I see so some of them are a mix of colors and some of them are the one plain color
wow that's really cool
so I missed this because I was working what else did you and Daddy do today besides go to Mikes
take out some of what
the things that you get at Mike's house
it's a scorpion can we trade
it does look like a scorpion
did you want to talk about reminding me of scary things did you want to talk about that movie you saw this weekend
yeah what happens in that movie
dinosaurs and people
it's Jurassic Park three
remember what are they trying to do in that movie
they want to find their son yup
what happens do you remember there's a kind of weird part in the movie
something grabs their son
what happens with that
way up in the sky a pterodactyl
sure
so what happened with the pterodactyl why'd he grab the boy
and then what happens
what happens to the boy when the pterodactyl has him
the other man saves him yeah
that was a good movie
what would you like to do today
you can do it when it's connected to your thumb
what did it used to stick onto
you and Daddy said it used to stick onto something earlier today
metal
why don't you try the cabinet
the file cabinet
it sticks on your window
sticks on boxes
it's not sticking on too much right now is it
maybe you can go over to that box
it does stick a little bit
it doesn't stick forever though huh
hey you know what
I don't think anyone knows about your really great soccer game this week
what almost happened when you were playing soccer
straight heading for the goal like this and then what happened
so he almost got two goals on Monday
wow maybe next time
so yeah soccer went really good this week
we made a video right
of your soccer game
what are we gonna do with the videos
so what are we gonna go do tomorrow
go to where
it's okay if you don't remember the name of the state what's there that we're going to see
probably see fish swimming in the water yup
what's that big body of water called that we are going to
no what's it called the water
is it a little creek or a lake
what's it called
the o
the ocean yup
so what do you think we're gonna do while we are at the ocean
are you talking to her or me
I bet she might like a slinky too
yeah that's okay
we can get it later right
I can take a look at it later
do you think I could have one of those slinkies for my office
do I get to chose one or do you chose one for me
it is
okay because they're your slinkies right
I don't mind
I just like having one so it doesn't matter what color it is really
now are you going to give all of them away to all of your friends
or are you going to keep most of them
did you give one to Daddy yet
okay
how about James
we're gonna actually go to James' house tonight
you know what he's going to do while we're gone
take care of the tortoise
no the cats Ingrid and Richie are taking care of
Irene and Gordon and James are gonna take care of the tortoise
what would you tell James about how to take care of the tortoise
what do you got_to do
what does he eat
lettuce and
so what do you got_to do with him
what do you got_to do with the lettuce and tomato
you turn the lettuce and tomato into little parts and then what
well what do you think what mistakes could they make that we should tell them to be careful about
what could they do the wrong thing about
so how do you think we should try and make it so that they do a good job
tell them
do you think we should also write it down maybe
because they might wonder how much tomato to give him or how much lettuce to give him
how much he might wanna eat
he usually has maybe this much this much tomato
maybe this much lettuce
his bowl is actually like this isn't it
so put in like a good amount of lettuce and then some tomato on the side or something
what if James asks if the tortoise can go down the stairs
no
we'll have_to warn him
don't put him on the stairs
what would happen to the tortoise
that would be sad wouldn't it
does the tortoise have a name
what's its name
Sesame wow
how big is he
his shell is about this big and all together he might be this big
he's pretty cool
is he slow or what would you say about how fast he goes
yeah he might be a little faster actually
he goes pretty fast sometimes
I'm trying to think what you've been doing Boo since we were here last time
you're hungry
here eat this
what did you and Daddy have for lunch today
Mike's house
you ate Mike's house
oh at his house
what did you eat
ice cream
oh okay
what was the actual food
crackers and carrots
and some ice cream
that's not too bad
what did Daddy and Mike eat
did you want any beans
I don't know how I feel about eating beans
oh you did
you said you were hungry
oh no don't put that in your mouth
that's gross
that was my bad idea
because I suggested you pretend to eat and then you really did eat it
it's all gone now
this also has that sticky kind of stuff
I bet if we unhooked it we could stick it on something
do you want to do play dough
do you want to mold something with the play dough
is it good or is it hard
what are you gonna cut
the play dough
okay you like to cut huh
I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing since we came here
well you've been helping Daddy with something at home
what's that
mhm
doing a good job
what's Daddy working on at home
well I know one thing you did that you got stickers for this week
doing potty well what do you have_to do when you do potty
because you've been able to do potty for a long time
what do you have_to do after that
I thought it was getting stickers for pulling up your pants
what did you get when you got so many stickers this week
well what are you going to do with that toy
you can trace them
and then you got little sheets right
and then you'll have little pictures of them
is there anything else you can do with the Spike thing
look at it
aren't there some mazes or something in there too
this is sort of interesting
what do you think you could put on this
