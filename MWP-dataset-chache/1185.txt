okay Sweetie I think that's Hok
and that's Lok
and that's Siew
I think it's Sow wait let me check the pronunciation
in the back
do do yep Siew
should I read
okay
three monks Hok Lok and Siew traveled along a mountain road
they talked about cat whiskers the color of the sun and giving
what makes one happy Siew asked Hok the youngest monk
old Siew who was the wisest said let's find out
this is Hok
the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of the village below
do you have a clock
xxx you wanna keep track of time on
oh yeah
my cellphone's out of battery
oh yeah you bet
I've got it we're at five after nine now
okay

uh now it says ten fifteen
yeah xxx the clock mm well we moved our clocks back and this one we can't seem to change but that's okay
okay

mhm
xxx are we ready for our story
okay
the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
yes Sweetie
what would you like
hm
how bout some mandarin oranges
in a bowl they're so sweet and delicious
how bout you wanna try one and see if you love them which I think you will
Honey

Honey I'm not hungry would you like some peach yogurt then
Sweetie I'll share it with you later but I already had breakfast and I'm not hungry now
Angel
Lily I'll have two bites
Sweetie you can't force other people to eat
Sweetie I already told you I'd have two bites
Sweetie
okay but then I changed my mind and said I'd have two bites right
xxx fine three bites
come on
over the couch
okay
I thought you wanted to give it to me
ooh that's big ooh xxx xxx xxx
okay
the sound of a bell brought their gaze to the rooftops of a village below
they could not see from so high above that the village had been through many hard times
famine floods and war had made the villagers weary and untrusting of strangers
they had even become suspicious of their neighbors
the villagers worked hard but only for themselves
there was a farmer a tea merchant a scholar a seamstress a doctor a carpenter and many others
but they had little to do with one another
that's the farmer
the tea merchant
the scholar which is like a teacher
that's the carpenter
the seamstress
and the doctor
when the monks reached the foot of the mountain the villagers disappeared into their houses
no one came to the gates to greet them
and when the people saw them enter the village they closed their windows tight
the monks knocked on the door of the first house
there was no answer
then the house went dark
they knocked on a second door and the same thing happened
it happened again and again from one house to the next
these people do not know happiness they all agreed
but today said Siew his face as bright as the moon we will show them how to make stone soup
they gathered twigs and branches and made a fire
they place a small tin pot on top and filled it with water from the village well
a brave little girl who had been watching came to them
what are you doing she asked
we're gathering twigs said Lok
we're making a fire said Hok
we're making stone soup and we need three round smooth stones said Siew
the little girl helped the monks looked around the courtyard until they found just the right ones
then they put them in the water to cook
these stones will make excellent soup said Siew
but this very small pot won't make much I'm afraid
my mother has a bigger pot said the girl
the little girl ran home
as she started to take her pot her mother asked what she was doing
the three strangers are making soup from stones she said they need our biggest pot
hm said the girl's mother stones are easy to come by I'd like to learn how to do that
the monks poked the coals
as smoke drifted up the neighbors peered out from their windows
a fire and a huge pot in the middle of the village was a true curiosity
of course old style stone soup should be well seasoned with salt and pepper said Hok
that is true said Lok as he stirred the giant pot filled with water and stones
but we have none
I have some salt and pepper said the scholar his eyes big with curiosity
he disappeared and came back with salt and pepper and even a few other spices
Siew took a taste
last time we had soup stones of this size and color carrots made the broth very sweet
carrots said the woman said a woman from the back I may have a few carrots
but just a few and off she ran
but she returned with as many carrots as she could carry carry as she dropped them into the pot
think it's gonna be good
do you think it would be better with onions asked Hok
oh yes maybe an onion would taste good said a farmer and he hurried off
he returned in a moment with five big onions and he dropped them into the bubbling soup
now that's a fine soup he said
the villagers all nodded their heads as the smell was very agreeable
but if only we had some mushrooms said Siew rubbing his chin
several villagers licked their lips
a few dashed away and returned with fresh mushrooms noodles pea pods and carrots
oh sorry not carrots cabbages
we already have carrots don't
yeah
something magical began to happen among the villagers
as each person opened their heart to give the next person gave even more
and as this happened the soup grew richer and smelled more delicious
I imagine the emperor would suggest we had dumplings said one villager
and bean curds said another
what about cloud ear and mung beans and yams cried some others
and taro root and winter melon and baby corn cried the other villagers
garlic ginger root soy sauce mini buds
are we gonna put you in the soup
are you a Lily bud
you're just a Lily
you're a Lily kid
do you think we could put you in the soup and eat you up cause you're so tasty
no
oh darn
there goes my snack
you are so silly
I have some I have some people cried out and off they ran returning with all they could carry
the monks stirred and the pot bubbled
how good it smelled
how good it would taste how giving the villagers had become
at last the soup was ready
the villagers gathered together
they brought rice and steamed buns they brought lychee nuts and sweet cakes they brought tea to drink and they lit lanterns
everyone sat down to eat
they had not been together for a feast like this for as long as anyone could remember
after the banquet they told stories they sang songs and they celebrated long into the night
then they unlocked their doors and took the monks into their homes and gave them very comfortable places to sleep
in the gentle spring morning everyone gathered together near the willows to say farewell
thank you for having us as your guests said the monks you have been most generous
thank you said the villagers with the gifts you have given we will always have plenty
you have shown us that sharing makes us all richer
and to think said the monks being happy is as simple as making stone soup
read this part
stone soup has its traditional roots in European folklore but there are many versions of the story
from France Sweden Russia England Belgium there are also related stories from Jamaica about a soup making pot and Korea about a magic cake tree and the Philippines about a bill paying hat
in this retelling I took xxx took the traditional form of the stone soup story and set it in China
I also used the Buddhist story tradition where tricksters spread enlightenment rather than seeking gain for themselves
the characters Hok Lok and Siew are prominent in Chinese folklore
they are three deities that bestow health wealth and prosperity
Hok symbolizes good fortune and prosperity
Lok symbolizes good health family happiness and mutual love
Siew symbolizes longevity and he brings good health and long life free from stress and obstacles
hm hm hm
thank you
well I don't think I have more applesauce but we can go to the supermarket and buy more later

Ariel

she swims like a fish
oh my gosh
wow
oh my gosh and does she live under the sea by herself
well who else lives under the sea
her daddy what's his name
oh king Triton right
and does she have any friends under the sea
Sebastian what is Sebastian
oh he's a crab
and Flounder's a fish
and who else
Scuttle's a bird Scuttle's a seagull right
a seagull
a seagull because seagulls like to fly around the sea
ooh look at that
and Ariel's got a nice head of hair there doesn't she
she has red hair huh
hm
who's that
oh
and who else
king Triton
wow
welcome to Atlantica
I'm princess Ariel
I'm a mermaid but my father king Triton has a magical trident that can transform me into a
human
it's as a human that I now live with my husband prince Eric in our palace on dry land
well how did that happen
oh my gosh wow
my father always told me to stay away from humans but I was so curious about them
one of my favorite things to do was to explore sunken ships
my best friend Flounder and I found the most wonderful human treasures inside them
Daddy said humans were cruel but I knew that any creature who could make things as beautiful as those creatures as those treasures couldn't be all bad
one day I found something amazing
back then I didn't know anything about the human world
but our friend Scuttle the seagull did
he told us it was a dingle_hopper and that humans used it to comb their hair
was he right
hm
xxx you're right that is so silly
then Flounder and I swam to a secret cave where I kept my human treasures
I turned on a music box and watched the tiny couple inside dance
I wished I could dance and be part of the human world
Flounder and I were arranging my treasures when a ship passed overhead
we swam up to take a look
suddenly a storm blew in
powerful waves pushed the ship closer to the rocks near the shore
then the human they called prince Eric fell overboard
I dove underwater to rescue him and I was able to pull him to shore
I had never been that close to a human before
I couldn't take my eyes off of him
I was so moved that I started to sing
that's when Eric opened his eyes
but then the prince's service servant sir Grimsby approached and I hid behind a rock and watched them walk away
father's advisor Sebastian the crab suddenly appeared at my side
we're going to forget this whole thing ever happened he said
later on Daddy came into my secret cave
Sebastian had told him everything
Daddy was furious and lectured me about my responsibilities as a princess
but I didn't want to be a princess I wanted to be a human girl
Daddy ordered me to stay away from humans and I told him
you're right

Daddy ordered me to stay away from the humans but I told him I couldn't do that
he lowered his trident and with a single blast destroyed all of my human treasures
I put my head down and cried
suddenly I felt something brush up against my arm
at my side were two eels that belonged to the sea witch Ursula
I had heard horrible stories about the sea witch but I was so upset I didn't care
I wanted to see prince Eric again and I followed the eels to Ursula's cave to see if she could help me
uh oh
Ursula
not so nice
mm mm
Ursula was very
creepy
xxx creepy
xxx she's so creepy
she offered to make me human for three days if I gave her my voice in exchange
uh oh that doesn't look good
she told me I would stay a human if prince Eric kissed me before the sunset on the third day
don't what
oh
uh oh
it doesn't look good
I thought about what Daddy had said but I was determined to see prince Eric again
as soon as I signed the contract my voice flowed into Ursula's seashell which was tied around her neck
uh oh
things are getting worse and worse
I sat in the water and stared at my new legs
they were amazing
when I stood up I felt so heavy
walking was very different from swimming or floating in the water
I was really a human
everyone disapproved of what I had done
only Scuttle was excited for me
Ursula is bad news scolded Sebastian
but it was too late for a warning
my friends had to help me find the prince if not I'd become Ursula's slave
uh oh
this doesn't sound good
I think we're gonna have a problem
luckily prince Eric found me on the beach
you seem very familiar he said
I wanted to tell him I was the one who had rescued him but I couldn't speak
he led me to his palace
it felt strange to walk but the prince held me tightly and helped me with each step
his servant showed me to my room and I put on a pink gown
at dinner prince Eric told me I looked beautiful
I smiled dreamily
it seemed like everything was falling into place
the next day Eric and I went out on his rowboat
Eric stopped the boat in a lagoon
there he leaned over to me and just as we were about to kiss splash
the boat flipped over
the kiss would have_to wait
oh no
what are we gonna
uh oh
I awoke on the third day happier than before but when I saw Eric he was with another woman called Vanessa
xxx oh no
what is going on
this does not look good
I heard him say our wedding ship departs at sunset
I was crushed Eric was going to marry Vanessa
what had gone wrong
what
I'd been certain that Eric had the same feelings for me as I did for him but now it was too late
I watched as Eric and Vanessa's wedding ship sailed into the distance
but Scuttle flew over and said I saw the bride in the mirror Vanessa is Ursula in disguise
egads
egads
now I understood Ursula had tricked Eric into marrying her
while Flounder pulled me onto the ship Scuttle and some other sea creatures swam ahead and interrupted the wedding dropping things on Vanessa and spraying her with water
Scuttle snatched the necklace from Vanessa which fell to the ground and shattered and my voice flowed back to me
and as loudly as I could I yelled Eric
you're the one said Eric it was you all the time
Eric leaned in to kiss me
it's too late Vanessa shrieked
the sun had just dropped below the horizon
suddenly as I changed back into a mermaid Vanessa changed back into Ursula
she is so creepy
Ursula took me to my father and showed him the contract
I might be willing to make an exchange Ursula said and Daddy agreed and took my place as Ursula's slave
it's so sad
what xxx gonna happen now
alright let's see
I had to save Daddy and the kingdom so I followed Ursula
she had used xxx my father's trident to make herself monstrously huge
oh no
but while I distracted Ursula Eric grabbed the wheel of the ship and steered the bow right into Ursula's cold heart
we had defeated the evil sea witch
yay
oh look what happens
Daddy was free and he forgave me for my selfishness
he also realized how much I loved Eric
he touched the water with his trident and transformed my tail into legs again
with his blessing Eric and I were married and lived happily ever after
yay
you want that one or do you want Jessie
we haven't read Jessie in a while
really

hm
tickle
duckuh duck
hi there my name's Dot
actually I'm princess Dot
next in line to be queen of the whole
ant hill
of course my sister Adda is actually queen right now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
you're right Adda was princess too and then there was a queen right
oh great
right
don't get me wrong I like being a princess but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troupe than perform royal duties
and besides Adda is a good queen even though she worries a lot
however she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
when she was a queen in training she used to get upset over everything
uh huh
uh huh
I we can't seem to find the cover for it
I don't know
yeah I'll look in a little bit okay
our anthill used to be in a ton of trouble
there were these big mean old
grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
we were all terrified of those grasshoppers
they barely left us enough food for ourselves in the winter
poor Adda I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
now my friend Flik he is a really cool guy
he is an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flik invented a harvesting machine
what are you doing
we have_to pull your tights up a little
yeah
yoink
