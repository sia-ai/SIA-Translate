why are you taking it off

okay
here's the lady walking down the street with her cat in a carriage
she's wearing a funny little hat
xxx walking by the red flowers
do you know what
I don't think that's a lady
I think that's a little girl dressed up like a mommy
doesn't that look like a little girl
so
the little girl's playing with her cat pretending her cat is a doll
an she walks along
and she's gonna pick some flowers
does that look like a dandelion
this flower
does that look like a dandelion to you
the flower
does that look like a dandelion
no
it looks like a rose cause it's a red flower
huh
so
when she's picking up the flowers the cat jumps out_of the carriage
and
she didn't see what happened
then she turned around and looked inside
my_goodness
the cat's gone
she gets very upset
she wonders where did the cat go and
he's hiding right behind the tree
is that a little smile on his face
he's playing a game
cat's playing a game
but the lady's very upset
the girl dressed up like a mommy is very upset
and
she goes running down the street
and
what's this
there's the policeman
he's got his whistle
he's got his hand up
and
he's stopping this little boy
on his tricycle
cause he's directing traffic
he's got a little badge
and
you know what
I don't think that's a real policeman
I think that's a boy dressed up as a policeman
isn't that
you know why I know
cause he looks short just like that little boy on the tricycle
and
it looks like that suit is a little bit too big for him
so
the little girl comes up
and
she says
oh my_goodness
my my little baby is gone
my little baby disappeared from my carriage
what can I do
what can I do
help me
help me
and
the policeman turns around
and
the cat shows up
he says
there's your little cat
and
everybody's looking and pointing at the cat
and
the cat still haves a little bitty smile cause he's still playing a game
he's still playing a game
well
I don't know why
but
he's having fun
everybody's having fun pretending
and
the policeman tries to go catch the cat
and
he dropped his whistle
and
he trips
and
he falls down
falls down
yeah
she's in with Mommy
don't worry about that
she's just cooing
and
look
she says chase my chase my child and
here's this little boy
and
he thinks it kinda funny right now
who's that on his shirt
do you know who that is
Batman
that's funny
he's got a Batman on his shirt and cowboy boots
that's funny
so
anyway
they keep on chasing him
and
there's the little boy policeman
and
he's chasing the cat
and
now the cat's getting angry
look at those eyes on that cat
the cat's getting angry
he's going into this
what is that
a tunnel
I think that's a a big pipe
I think he's gonna try to hide again
look
the policeman's chasing him
the girl's looking at what's happening
what's that guy doing with his hands in his pockets
is he helping
how could he be helping if he's got his hands in his pockets
could you do me a favor
when I read you a story
you know what I'm talking about
okay
so
let's see what happens next
this is a longer story than I thought it was
what
that's the one I think that may be the same one that bed at our house
so
look
they're looking at one end of the pipe
and
the policeman sticks his head in
and
the little boy is sitting on the pipe and
the mommy is looking at what the policeman's doing
look
the pipe goes through a little tiny hill and out the other side
the cat's already out
and
he's poking his head down
and
he looks at the policeman at the other side of the pipe
xxx that funny
the policeman comes out
and
he doesn't see anything
and
he falls
kaplunk
and
the mommy comes throught the pipe
but
before she falls coming out_of it she sees the cat
look at that cat's face now
he's still trying to run away
and
the policeman isn't very happy
and
the girl isn't very happy
so
the policeman helps the little girl down out_of the pipe
she's about to step on her pearls
look at that
she's gonna step on those pearls
so
the policeman's helping her down
and uh oh
she falls
boom
right on the policeman and knocks him over again
and
his hat falls off
and
her hat falls off
and
look
the cat's coming back
the cat's coming back down to see what's happened
and
they both fall
they go splash
it looks like there's water there
right
see the little waves coming in
and look
the cat goes back into the pipe
and they're all wet
but
they see the cat's coming
look
her hat fell on his head
isn't that funny
oh well
so
now they go up
and
they're gonna chase the cat again
and
they chase him throught the pipe
first the little girl goes in
and
now the little boy goes in
and
then look
they get to the other end of the pipe
and
the second little boy has caught the cat
and
he's about to give it back to them
but the cat jumps up on the policeman's head
and
look at that
and
he's scratching at him and pawing at him and tickling him
just like that
and
he's climbing all over him
and
the little policeman can't do anything about it
that's what happened
and
the mommy is angry at the little boy
she's pulling his ear
I don't know why that's xxx
because the little boy put the cat on the policeman's head
that was a silly thing to do
and
now the cat goes running up a tree
and
that little policeman is really mad
look at his face
it's scratched now by the cat
you wouldn't like it if a cat went
scratch scratch scratch
is that like what Rover does to you
go
scratch scratch scratch
is Rover a yellow cat
I've never seen a yellow cat like that before
so
the policeman is chasing up the cat the cat up the tree
and
the cat goes to another branch
and
the mommy is crying cause she thinks the cat is going to escape
and
the little boy is pointing up at what's happening
all of a sudden the policeman finally catches the cat right behind the neck
right like that
cat's aren't ticklish right back there
not like you
and
look
the boy who's happy over here
and
now he's sticking out his tongue
and
the the little girl who's sad over here
and
now she's smiling
that's funny
the girl gets happier
but
that branch isn't big enough for everybody
and
the boy lost his balance
and
he dropped the cat
and
the mommy caught the cat
but
look
that branch is breaking
and
down comes the policeman
kerplunk
and
he lands on the second little boy
look
the leaves are falling down
and
the branch is falling down
oh
it looks like the little policeman hurt his foot cause he's using the branch to walk like a cane
and
here comes the cat and the policeman and the mommy
and
the little boy is in the carriage all of a sudden
oh
that's funny cause the cat bed there at the beginning
so
they finally get home
and
there's the policeman sitting down
and
he doesn't look too happy
and
here's the little boy in the carriage
and
he's had fun time
and
here's the cat
and the mommy's going off into the house
look
what happens at the end
what is she wearing now
what
she's pretending to be a nurse
