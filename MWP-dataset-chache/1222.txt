what's frying
frying means when you put food in a pan on the stove with some oil or butter and the food cooks in the in the hot oil or the hot butter
frying is different from boiling boiling means when water gets very hot
let's see how do I explain this
when water gets very hot an' it starts to make bubbles because it's so hot then it's boiling
and sometimes you can cook food in boiling water or you can just make tea or coffee with boiling water
cooking things in water is called boiling them
cooking things in oil or butter is called frying them
what am I doing
