everything turned
down and up and up and down and around and around
yeah the headlights are popping out
that's a xxx those are the that's the signal
for the cars to stop and go but they're popping out

Peter saw his dog Willie coming
quick as a wink
he hid in an empty box
lying on the sidewalk
wouldn't it be funny if I whistled Peter thought
Willie would stop and look all around to see who it xxx was
Peter tried again to whistle
but still he couldn't
so Willie just walked on
Peter got out of the box and started home
on the way home he took some colored chalks out of his pocket and
drew a long long line
look at that
he drew it right around the girls jumping rope
and still he's drawing it
joop
joop
right up to his door
he stood there and tried to whistle again
he blew until his cheeks were tired but
nothing happened
he went into his house and put on his father's old hat
to make himself feel more grown up
he looked in then to the mirror to practice whistling
still no whistle
when his mother saw what he was doing
Peter pretended that he was his father
he said I've come home early today dear is Peter here
his mother answered
why no he's outside with Willie
well I'll go out and look for them said Peter
he's pretending to be his daddy
first he walked along a crack in the sidewalk
then he tried to run away from his shadow
there's his shadow
he jumped off his shadow
but when he landed
they were together again
he came to the corner where the box was and who should he see but
Willie
Peter scrambled under the box he blew
and blew
and
suddenly out came a real whistle
Willie stopped and looked around to see who it was
it was him that's right

Thomas was a little blue steam engine
there's a tender up there yeah
he lived on the island of Sodor with many other engines
you getting some juice out of there
to push it down a little huh
there ya go
what's Toby doing
chugging along happily
sometimes Thomas pulled his coaches Annie and Clarabelle
hurry hurry said the coaches
sometimes Thomas pulled freight cars
faster faster said the foolish freight cars
they would xxx try to push Thomas down the hill
and sometimes Thomas traveled all by
hm
is the what
sometimes Thomas traveled all by himself across the island
he chugged in the rain
he huffed in the sun
and he puffed in the snow
there is nothing a train cannot do Thomas said proudly
one morning Henry the green engine would not come out of his shed
he had
he had
boiler ache yep
so Sir Topham Hat asked Thomas to help
peep peep Thomas said to the people
I can take you where you want to go
soon clouds gathered
the sky grew dark
thunder rumbled
plip plop clunk
hail began to fall
it fell on Thomas
it fell on the tracks
suddenly Thomas's driver saw trouble ahead
slow down
said the driver
the hail had made a crack right there in the track
Thomas came to a stop
his driver called out
we cannot go forward and
we can't go back
we must not go back
there's the crack
everyone off the conductor said
now what shall we do
said the people
they climbed down from the coaches and climbed up to the road
Bertie the bus was just passing by
Bertie beeped his horn merrily
a bus is as good as a train he said
I can take you where you want to go
hm
all the people climbed on board Bertie
Bertie scooted down the road
a bus is as good as a train the people said
suddenly Bertie's driver saw trouble ahead
slow down
the driver said
why did they have_to slow down
hm
do you remember
why did they have_to slow down Ethan
why
why
why
dere in the road was a bright green toad
Bertie came to a stop
his driver called out there's a toad in the road we'll have_to unload
everyone off said Bertie's driver
that toad in the road caused a fuss on the bus
what will happen to us
the people said
then they walked down the road to another train station
but the trains were not running
why not
said the people
they soon found out
what does that say
no trains yep
Thomas was still stuck at the crack in the track
Percy was stuck there at Thomas's back
Gordon was stuck behind Thomas and Percy
James with two freight cars was quite in a hurry
there's Gordon yep
mm that's right James behind Gordon
the freight cars were needed in the yard
but James could not get past Gordon and Percy and Thomas
and the foolish freight cars refused to back up
no no no they said
we
ow
will not go they said
they're pretty silly huh
so no train could move up
and no trains could move back
they were stuck where they were at that
at that
at that
at this
at that
crack in the track
mm they were stuck where they were at the crack in track
it rhymes
I guess there are some things a train cannot do said Thomas's driver
we need help said Thomas
and I know just who to call
who are they gonna call
who
who are they gonna call
it's a little more left huh
Thomas's driver called Sir Topham Hat
and told him Thomas's plan
an excellent plan Sir Topham Hat said
please thank Thomas he added
in no time at all
in no time at all Harold the helicopter zoomed across the sky
he landed near the people
they all climbed aboard
a helicopter as good as
is as good as a train said Harold
I can take you where you want to go
the breakdown crew came
they had to replace the broken track
by the time they arrived rain was falling hard
the crew came with cranes
they sang while they worked
a crane is as good as a bus or a train
we'll fix up your track and we
don't mind the rain hm
xxx finally Thomas could move
so could Percy and Gordon
yep there's Cranky
James with his freight cars was close behind
they turned on the turntable and went back to work
there is Cranky
the people saw Thomas waiting to take them home
are you sure you can take us where we want to go
they asked
I thought there was nothing a train could not do said Thomas
but now I know that just isn't true
I learned a xxx big lesson from one little crack
a train is only as good as its track
crack
