Rudolph the rabbit nose

is that a real one
or
is that just a toy
hmhm

how many are there
eight kittens
how many reindeer were there
Weren't there nine reindeer
are you sure
or was he the ninth
or were there seven
how many are there
how does that song go that names all the names
yeh they all have names
did you want to go play ball with me today
today when I go out there
did you want to go with me
you didn't have your room done though did you
no you didn't
uhmum
guess what
oh yeh
what are they
two elves
did you write that
how come you wrote them backwards
oh heh
you must write left handed then
everything's backwards
is that right
oh has she got one like that
here it goes again
look at all those spiders
how many spiders do you suppose are there
are those tadpoles on that frog's back
I can't see
are those tadpoles
I guess so
there's a bee
why don't you tell me what you did to at school today
was Mrs Haynes in there today with you
what'd you do
did ya make something
I don't know
oh you drew the cow
you colored it
I'm sorry
was that did you see black and white cows at the dairy yesterday is that color they were
what kind of cows are they what are their names do you know
were they Guernsey cows or xxx
they didn't tell you what kind they were
that looks like Nibbles or Kibbles
actually it looks like Sam
are there gerbils
well there are guinea pigs
there they are
um hm
have you heard them stomp
they sure do race through that cage
so they can exercise
what kind was it
what was it
toy gerbil
I bet that was a rubber mouse that you give to cats
do you think
what do you think cats would do with a rubber mouse
they wouldn't run very fast would they
they wouldn't have_to
wouldn't have_to catch it
are elephants scared of those
that's a hamster
how old was he
so he lived twice as old as he was supposed to be
what does that say
no you're big
what's at one
back yard
no
your big back yard
you can read it better there can't you
what about that
good
what does that look like
is that supposed to be the wind
that's pretty
you know what
I was gonna get some thistle from grandpa and I forgot it
it's a kind of seed for birds
they
you know those yellow birds gold+finches that Grandpa has on his bird feeder
to come here
but you need thistle
they eat thistle
that's a different kind of seed
I guess it's hard to find
a_lot_of the stores don't have it
and he was going to give me some but we forgot to remind him
mhm
they're good
I used to eat them
they're good
they're salty
some of them are salty
I guess the ones you give birds aren't salty
um do you suppose that's the way Nibbles and Kibbles eat their sunflower seeds
do they eat that part of it too
or just the insides
I've seen some of the shells laying there but I think they must eat it sometimes and not other times
have you read this story
how'd you know that was the wind
it looks like a man to me
but I think you're right
it's supposed to be the wind
look at all that trash
we can show
oh
look at this
dragons of the sea
you know what that is what kind of animal that is
iguana
wow
they look just like rocks too unless you look closely
how many are there
they're ugly aren't they
you don't want an iguana for a pet
no
good reasoning Bill
I said good reasoning
look at these neat rocks
we saw some like this when we went to Washington
they're fluorescent rocks
well that means when you turn on a turn the lights off they sort of glow in the dark
there's an electrical energy inside it or something
mhm
where did he find them
are those the shiny ones the valuable ones
in his yard
but you didn't
look at all those shiny rocks
see this is the rock the way it looks before with the lights on and then you turn the lights off and that's the way it looks
okay
mhm
these are gerbils
what are they doing
is that what their mommy looked like
is that what they looked like when they were babies
do we need one of those
wheel
have you seen them
where can we get one
hm
where you think we can get one
that's probably a good place
maybe
mhm
