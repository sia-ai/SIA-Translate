will you have_to find the other parts of the train
have you seen them around
you saw some did you play with the doll house yesterday
where
they're at Doctor Hartzell's office
oh I don't know where they are
I haven't seen them for a long time
I don't know
did you make that
something made out_of clay
did you make it at home
I mean at school
