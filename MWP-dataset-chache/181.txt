look in the front and see what's there
look at that
what do you think you'd like to do with it

you have_to take something off
see you have_to take these off
do you have a screw+driver
get a screw+driver

okay now take remove that okay
that's it
turn it the other way

that's it
screw it together
okay turn
good
oh very good
alright now xxx put that one all back
don't wanna repair this
wanna drive it
alright where does that piece go
I don't know
why don't you open the front and see if it belongs in the front
I guess not
look in the back
check the back maybe it's something that goes in the back
no
I think it's an extra then
why don't you slip it somewhere
why don't you put it in somewhere
there okay
that's a pretty nice car huh
what
oh that has a book in it for a story
would you like to hear a story
would you like to play store
huh
oh look you have a store here
oh just like you have in school
my_goodness look at that
do you remember we saved packages
for school
would you like to play store
what would you like to do
would you like me to read you a story
would you like to find out what the story book's all about

go ahead
isn't it a nice little cash register
what
I would be glad to
but we have_to get a screw+driver
and we have_to take off the tire
okay
like that
yeah you just keep turning that then that will come off
keep turning keep turning keep turning just move your wrist as you turn
can you move your wrist
like this alright

remember we went there and had our tire fixed
yeah
oh alright open it up now
let's go
okay can I give you a little help
okay now put the other tire on
go ahead
put it on
good you can use a screw+driver or you know you can even use your wrist you can even do it like this for a while until you can turn it like that
that's it
