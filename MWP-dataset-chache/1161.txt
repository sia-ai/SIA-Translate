remember what this one's called
what's it called
beauty
and the beast
long ago an enchantress cast a spell on a castle and she transformed the handsome young prince into a hideous beast
and his servants into household objects
just look at me grumbled the beast I've been so cruel holding Belle captive in my castle how will she ever see me as anything but a monster
come now said Mrs Pots gently all you have_to do is show her what's inside your heart you must act like a gentleman Lumiere said
be romantic compliment her and most of all be kind gentle and sincere
and don't be so grumpy added Chip Mrs Pots young son
Mrs Pots gave her son a stern look but they all knew Chip was right
who's that
Lumiere
I have an idea said the beast smiling why don't I invite Belle to go on a sleigh ride
it just snowed outside and she might like the fresh air
perfect said Lumiere a wonderful idea agreed Mrs Pots
very romantic
bless you
thank you
added Chip that's enough out of you Mrs Pots said to Chip trying not to smirk
the beast xxx Lumiere to extend his invitation
that sounds lovely said Belle I've been stuck in this castle far too long
she ran down the long staircase and stepped outside
glimmering white snow flakes fell from the sky it was a perfect white day
just then the beast pulled up in a gleaming horse drawn sleigh
how beautiful exclaimed Belle
the beast smiled as he took her hand and helped her into the sleigh
he didn't mention he had slept all morning polishing it just for her
once she was settled he covered her with a warm blanket
they took off across the powdery snow Belle laughed happily as the beast guided the sleigh through the forest path
soon they came to a clearing in the woods before then was a frozen pond
the beast pulled on the reins and stopped at the xxx the edge of the pond
this is such a magical place said Belle how did you ever find it
I used to come here long ago said the beast it was one of y favorite places and I wanted to share it with you
then the beast took out a picnic basket filled with snacks
what are they eating
xxx they have hot chocolate
and cookies
right and
and fruit and bread too
that sounds like a good snack doesn't it
mm yummy
when they had finished their meal the beast asked Belle if she wanted to ice skate
oh yes she said father and I used to go every winter I love ice skating
soon Belle was spinning effortlessly across the pond's smooth surface
the beast was less graceful hitting a bump in the ice he lost his balance and toppled to the ground
at first he was angry but then he saw Belle looking at him kindly
remembering his friends' advice he smiled as Belle helped him to his feet
every one falls sometimes said Belle it's part of learning
before long they were gliding across the ice arm in arm enjoying each other's company in the crisp winter air
they grew tired and decided to rest
just then a timid fawn wandered out of the forest
poor thing said Belle she looks scared and hungry
taking an apple from their picnic basket Belle showed the beast how to gently feed the young deer
soon the sun was setting it was time to go as they made their way home Belle thought about the day she had spent with the beast
there was something different about him he had shown her a kinder softer side
perhaps they could be friends after all
is that what comes next
oh xxx
what's this one called
right is it called the dance lesson
mm
how do you ask nicely
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince
and every maiden in the land is invited
that means me too
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
they loved their Cinderella
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
I can only go if I finish my chores
and today step mother has given me more work than ever
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball he step sisters cried
mend my dress polish my shoes iron my cloak
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
suddenly Jacques had an idea
I know he said we'll help Cinderella and all the other mice nodded in agreement
what would I do without you Cinderella said patting them on the head you're so good to me
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
everyone would be dressed in the the finest clothes Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the handsome young prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming oh no she said I've never been to a ball I don't even know how to dance
don't worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
with that Jacques bowed before Perla and extended his hand
dance please he asked Perla blushed as she took Jaques' hand
Gus was the conductor he got all the birds to sing
Jacques and Perla spun around and around gliding across the floor
honey is the mouse's name Jack or Jacques
it's Jacques and Gus
okay
Cinderella watched and then copied their movements
just listen and move see said Perla not so scary
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
good Cinderella said Jacques beaming a lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderelli
and the mice collapsed on the floor laughing thank you so much Cinderella said to her friends
with your help tonight might be the night all my dreams come true
xxx it is Ariel next look at that
a special surprise
is Ariel swimming
who's she swimming with
flounder wow
are they friends
please
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
every mermaid and merman were in bed fast asleep
everyone but princess Ariel and her friend flounder
hurry up flounder cried Ariel it's almost time for the party we can't be late
trying not to make a sound Ariel and flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
they began their journey towards the surface but Ariel said flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
remember the last time your father got so angry
you know how he feels about humans
that's why this time xxx
okay
oh you need blankie oopy

okay
yes
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a ship wreck was having a royal ball xxx
Ariel had a very special surprise for him
swim faster flounder she cried flounder raced to keep up
just as Ariel and flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
when they poked their heads out of the water Ariel and flounder saw colorful lights explode in the air above prince Eric's castle
I've never seen anything so beautiful in all my life said Ariel
the human world is a wonderful place
sure is pretty said flounder
do you think prince Eric is happy
or do you
think he's sad
he's happy oh good
off in the distance prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life in the ship wreck
why has she disappeared he wondered
xxx flounder spotted the prince first
look Ariel he said
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw prince Eric
it's time for my surprise she said winking at flounder
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and flounder hid behind it
ready asked flounder
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
do you need me to get blankie honey
what's blankie doing
he's on
the ground
oh my
gosh what's he doing on the ground
you can't reach blankie

be gentle with it don't hurt it
what do you say into your microphone
hello

hi Lily
should we keep reading
gentle with that okay
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
she sang a song she had written just for Eric
it was Ariel's special gift to him
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
it can't be he said I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song filling the night air
when the song was over Eric looked down across the sea
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
who are you he called but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered
just wait and see
okay
whatever could be keeping the dwarves said Snow White
it's getting late
and they should be home from the diamond mine by now
while she waited Snow White busied herself tidying up the cottage in the woods
what messy little fellows she said
just then Happy came through the front door
he tugged on Snow White's long yellow skirt
what
xxx Snow White he said come quickly a young deer is hurt in the woods
oh no cried Snow White the poor thing we must hurry
they soon reached a small clearing and everyone stood in a circle around the deer
do you know what the dwarves' names are
well I think there's Happy
and there's Grumpy he looks Grumpy right
and that's Dopey
and that's Sneezy he's always sneezing
that's Doc he's the doctor
and there's Bashful
and there's Sleepy I think
is so sleepy sleepy
he is yawning because he's so tired
oh xxx
to take a nap he's so tired
he must be cold said Snow White covering the deer with her long cape
maybe he's just tired said Sleepy yawning
a nice long rest should do the trick
xxx mommy's yawning too
xxx what a big yawn
well you could be right Sleepy said Snow White but xxx
he's not closing eyes
his eyes
and that's Dopey right
yeah
maybe he has a hachoo a cold said Sneezy
he looks like he might be a little bit stuffy
well that's possible but he probably would've stayed in his thicket until he was feeling better said Snow White
I know said Happy maybe he's feeling sad and needs a little cheering up
I'm sure that would help Happy but it looks like he may need something more than a merry story or a song
I xxx I don't know for sure said Bashful softly
but perhaps he's too shy to let us know what's the matter
we all feel shy sometimes don't we Bashful said Snow White
then Dopey started pacing back and forth and pointing over his shoulder
hm said Snow White you could be right Dopey
he could be lost
I bet I know what happened grumbled Grumpy
the wicked queen probably cast a spell on him
she's always up to no good
suddenly Doc pushed his way past the others and approached the deer
may I lake a took xxx
I mean take a look he said adjusting his eye glasses
and he knelt down beside the deer
well would you look at that cried Doc
the poor deer must have stepped on a
a thorn ouch
Doc gently removed the sharp thorn and the deer jumped up and licked him
how relieved you must be cried Snow White
now run along home she said to her new friend your family must be worried
the deer licked Snow White's hand and ran into the forest
that's the deer
oh uh the bushes you mean
yeah
that's the deer's ear
this is
these are the bushes the green bushes you mean
that's just the sky
yeah that's
the sky see there's a bush there and then the
all the yellow stuff even behind him there is the sky

I'm so proud of each and every one of you
said Snow White
xxx the sky is on him
oh no

yeah
that night Snow White and the seven dwarves made a delicious dinner
then when they had all had their fill they sang and dances until it was time for bed
yey
oh what's this one about
it's about Jasmine and what's his name
Aladdin
Aladdin and Jasmine had just gotten married
people had come from near and far to celebrate
it had been the largest wedding in the history of Agraba
now Aladdin and Jasmine were preparing to take a trip far far away
Abu stay out of those bags warned Aladdin smiling at his curious little friend
that food is for our trip
Jasmine's going to be so surprised when she sees what I've planned
she has lived most of her life within the walls of this palace and now we are going to see the world together
soon Aladdin and Jasmine stood on the balcony ready to begin their adventure
the magic carpet awaits you said Aladdin
you're going to see things you've never seen before a whole new exciting world Aladdin replied
let's get going said Jasmine I can't wait
Jasmine Aladdin and Abu settled on the magic carpet
then they took off soaring high above the palace
Jasmine laughed with delight the wind blowing her long hair behind her
look how small everything looks she said
it's like a dream
after a little while the magic carpet began its descent
are we there asked Jasmine
almost said Aladdin
close your eyes I want this to be a surprise
suddenly the magic carpet landed on top of a high cliff and Jasmine heard a noise that sounded like crashing water
oh what is it
it's water it's the ocean
Jasmine couldn't believe her eyes she'd never seen anything so beautiful
the water was a brilliant shade of turquoise and dolphins leapt in and out of the water as if they were dancing
huge ocean waves crashed onto a white sandy beach
in the distance
she have a skirt on
did
we see the ocean when we were with Tamar and Rafi on the beach
yeah and we saw the crashing waves
we saw waves
there xxx
another wave and
what kind of birds did we see
what kind of birds were we chasing on the beach
seagulls you're right
right
they flew away we didn't catch them
right
and did we play on the beach too
yeah and did we go to the library with Tamar
that was fun wasn't it
hm
they had a wonderful time swimming and enjoying the sun and
when he and Jasmine were ready to go Aladdin snapped his fingers
time for our next destination he said
within seconds the magic carpet appeared
once again Aladdin asked Jasmine to cover her eyes as they descended Jasmine felt the air grow colder
okay Jasmine you can open your eyes now
what did they see
snow
what is it Jasmine asked bending down to touch the cold white powder
it's snow answered Aladdin isn't it wonderful
it falls from the sky when it's cold
it's amazing cried Jasmine it looks like a soft white cloud
watch out she called Abu had thrown a snowball and it was headed straight for Aladdin
they spent the rest of the day playing in the snow and built snow+men and made snow+angels
they even used the magic carpet as a sled to slide down a nearby hill
soon the sun began to set and the air grew tolder colder
I think it's time to take off said Aladdin
you show me places so different from Agraba
there are plenty of brand new worlds for us to share said Jasmine
and as they made their way back to the palace Jasmine smiled
she knew this was just the beginning of their wonderful life together
it was
time to go right it was getting late

I hope they ate their dinner already
