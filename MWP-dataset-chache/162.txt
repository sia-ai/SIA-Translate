well there's plenty of soup so you can have some tomorrow

I think so
and Saturday night at the Connor's
because they're on the way home
you're right
okay
what did you tell the Lyon's
oh I don't know but I just looked it up in my book and tomorrow's the Lyon's
yeah but I mean as far as dinner
I don't remember

make sure that they're not going to have for us
your spaghetti
yeah I think so
here
oh thank_you
mm great
just to make up for your hum
light lunch
it wasn't really light
it was two roast beef sandwiches
I was xxx
thing is I was xxx
pardon
yes
well anyway Mommy had it so it wasn't wasted
how about if we put your napkin in front of you so_that you don't get your new jammie blanket all full of spaghetti
well do you want it to be all full of spaghetti
your first day of wearing your new jammie blanket
there
well that's one thing about spaghetti it always falls off
did you have fun playing with Sharon today
hm it warmed up
we had a_lot_of melting
yes I'm beginning to see the grass in places
really
mhm
well it couldn't have melted that much
well it's pulling where people have had their sidewalks plowed the snow's pulling away and you can see grass in certain places
hm
gee
I did my long walk
I gotta good shoes
my feet are really beginning to hurt
my arches hurt
mm
that's that's the one thing
she recommends in xxx
that's right
well Betty Hossefatt in Ron's told me that there's a store in Cambridge called the Run_a_thon
it sells excellent shoes for joggers
being that I am walking briskly on A_M aerobics program I was thinking of going there
mhm
think so
got an estimate from Norstrom
one thousand dollars if we do the work three thousand
if he does the work
is this the one you like
no
he was just very quiet
I have a feeling
one thousand instead of three hundred
we y you had a three hundred bid didn't you
yeah right
I think Bob Higgens is gonna get our
did you laugh in his face
no he
what did he say
no he sent me it in the mail
mm
try this
it was very well written up though
xxx I'm sorry
have another one
did you describe anything to me about Norstrom
no but he came in a suit and a tie
very quiet didn't say much of anything
well who is the guy who's the guy you liked the best
Sherman
and I haven't gotten his yet
oh
but I imagine his is going to be comparable
mm
I just have this feeling
I don't know Bob Higgens seems to be more in our price range
and what was his bid
three hundred and six hundred
yeah
think he's gonna get the job
what
think I'm going to get the job
no
you think he's gonna get the job
well I mean if Sherman comes up with a two thousand for him to do all the work I think Bob Higgens is gonna get the job yeah
I mean that's one thousand five hundred dollars difference
maybe we can
yeah we can just tell Higgens we want him to put up the new plaster board
yeah well I I'm sure that will increase it you know somewhat but
how many total bids did you solicit
six
no ten
ten or eleven
oh
how many total have you got_to date
Rand Sherman's my last one
huh
mu
oh yeah
know why
cause you got some on your mouth and then it
Sherman's the only one out
mhm
Norstrom and Sherman came the same day
Norstrom's
oughta
Norstrom
oughta get Sherman's tomorrow
Norstrom is high
he's the highest so far
there was another
yes he is the highest so far because Billy England uh was my first one and he was the highest
for him to do just the preparation cause I never asked him if he would do everything
his was only
his was
I mean like maybe four hundred or five hundred
uhhuh
and that was the highest for preparation but um
is the rule of thumb you know you double whatever their preparation is and you get their paying cost
no I don't know what the rule of thumb is because I didn't ask them all that question
because it wasn't until I was half way through talking to these people that you decided that you decided that maybe it would be worth us asking them to do all the work
how many uh people did you ask in all
the last four
now three of them have doubled it
yeah
da last four two doubled it and one only gave me an estimate for when he did all the work
and you never gave anything back from that called you called up and you answered
mm
see that's why it would've been nice if you'd taken me seriously when I first started talking
hm
otherwise I could've had twelve estimates
oh here there now xxx now
it wasn't that I didn't take you seriously
it's just that I just didn't think at the time about how unrealistic it would be for you to try to do the painting yourself
that's cause I don't think that you got really into it
that's true
I didn't get into it
I wish you'd gotten into it at the time when I started discussing it
I think I made too much here
we're not going to be eating all of this
how are you doing Susan
well you eat as much as you can
this is really nice
you can go to nursery school tomorrow
I thought we wouldn't be able to
why
because we're not going to leave for New Jersey until after nursery school's over
cause Daddy has some work until then
you can put up you can go and visit your auntie again and all those pretty clothes
when you get dressed up when you're over there
you'd like me to stay there for a little bit
you want me to be your auntie
okay I I'll stay a little bit
I'd like to walk too though
okay
but I'll stay and we'll play for a bit and then I'll go and do my walking
hm
you're full
where did you get this jammie blanket
did Mommy and you go uh this afternoon
mm
it's a size six
for a six year old
no kidding
now that's twice as big and old as you
I finally found out where Jack's is
I drove past it on my way way to Jane Cook's
so I know where that store is now
hm
does she live in Briggffona
yeah
oh
you have_to pull em up like a skirt when you walk
poor Andrea called today
why is she poor
well because she was thinking of enrolling Beth
oh
and I told her she said
I'm I'd like to come next week
mm
to the nursery school and I
said Andrea it's already enrolled for next year
um
petals
petals
mm
why does a flower xxx
I think that this is supposed to be where the pollen is
and the petals are pretty colors that attract bees so they'll come and make the honey
well that's not a real flower
so they can't
you're right they can't
but in a real flower from a real flower they could make honey
because there's no nectar in a pretend flower
only in real flowers
well cause that's just made out_of straw or something
it's not
actually the bees make the honey in their bodys
they just use the pollen to do it
no
is it pollen
pollen and nectar
listen we just read a book yesterday about bees making honey
hm
they use pollen and nectar
mhm
what is nectar
Susan'll show you
mhm
Susan knows all about the worker bees
and the queen bee
mm
yeah
mhm
I
flop flop flop flop
flop flop and the xxx go xxx
are those their wings going flop flop flop
flap
flap flap flap
and those are
are those milk+weed pods
wait a minute what kind of weeds are those
no that's clover
clover
right
what a dummy I am
but what about the nectar and the pollen
that's the part I'm interested in
yes
mm
hm
hm
that's right
how come
they work until they die
those worker bees
oh
and most of their
oh no this is real
they really do this Susan
hm
but in real+life bees do lay eggs just like that
the queen bees she
only the queen bee lays eggs
hm
your right
hm
and these little things are the cells in the honeycomb
where the uh bays the the bees mature
hm
and they're coming out
he's coming out_of a cell
has he just been born
how can you tell
can you can tell from looking at him he's a worker bee
hm
they don't discuss that with
putting honey in it
oh he's collecting it from the hives
what are they doing
mm
well know an interesting thing is that bees don't fly at night time because they don't see and they come out to what the problem is and the skunks eat them
oh really
skunks eat bees
yep
they're very brave
they don't expect it either
hm
thank_you
you did a very good job of interpreting that for me Susan
maybe we can go over that again at coffee time
xxx would you like a little more spaghetti
hm
that come in the mail today
hm
okay aw I looked closely
it looks to me like they're all consuming
looks like they're at the check out counter of a supermarket and they're all buying things and that's what the people who make this newspaper would like us to do
you're very handy with that chair
oh what muscles
strong girl
Sharon brought over a color
was that Sharon's coloring book Susan where you made the horse by following the dots
wa was that one of
was that Sharon's
oh should find that and show it to Daddy

boo boo
and Sharon said Susan followed the numbers in order
no
really
is it the last one
oh I beg your pardon what's an ogoo
I'm telling you
it's a good thing all her friends don't use toilet words
otherwise I think we'd be in the toilet
hm
as a result
actually we'll probably go through that she's four anyway
hm
there's a horse
a
did Sharon do some of that too
yes
hm
that came out very nicely
there are numbers there in the twenties so
oh I guess she did them all
I was rather surprised when Sharon said that but
than you lovey for showing me that
hm
oh I'm getting full too
now you know me
I never stop eating

I'm not quite there yet
oh

it's hard to wait isn't it Susan
reassuring
sympathizing
well I don't know
I was actually listening about how hard it was
I know
oh
I was I was the one who was reassuring
yes
yes
well because he
does he still wear them
wet his diapers so much that he wet his pants
and he couldn't go home in wet pants
he would've gotten cold so we put those dry pants on him
has Susan
and he took em home but he'll bring them back the next time he comes to see us
have you and Susan had chicken pox
well I've had chicken pox
Susan hasn't
why
she's liable to get them now
what
you mean because_of going to nursery school
no
because I was exposed to em today
oh well no
not because you were exposed to them but she has_to be exposed to them
that's right
I would have_to actually have it for her to get it from me
yeah
have you had chicken pox
yes
as a little boy
I'm still not convinced it was chicken pox
it was Chris Bullis in one of the class where I work
and I he showed me this this little thing on his tummy
it looked to me like a mole that he had scratched and irritated
it was getting infected
so we sent down to the nurse and she said it was chicken pox
I wonder if it was impetigo
is it just one mark
yeah
is that right
well that could happen
you just get one mark and that's chicken pox
it's good for you
you know that sort of thing
you mean that's all you get
yeah
but anyhow that does happen to some people
oh I have such a nice little girl up on my lap
but that's hard to diagnose only on one mark
it would be much easier to diagnose when you xxx at the stages
