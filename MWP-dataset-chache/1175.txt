yeah
right
and last last time I slept in your bed Nemo told me that he didn't have enough room to sleep
it's true
yeah he said I was taking up too much room
that's right
more room for Nemo when Mommy sleeps in her own bed

you were so cute
that's right
that's right
you know what you ate a lot of when we were in Ireland
a lot of chocolate
yes we could not find very much to eat there
and when we took our big long airplane ride
this is what they gave you for lunch ready
they gave you fish and chips
which you didn't wanna eat because it was just kind of this weird fried fish
and you didn't like it
and then they gave you chocolate pudding with chocolate sprinkles
yeah you liked that
and then they gave you little chocolate M and Ms
you liked that
and then they gave you a chocolate bar too
you liked that too
so you ate all your chocolate and you were bouncing off the walls because you were so full of chocolate energy
it's true
but and you probably don't remember this but there were lots_of kids on our airplane
because they were on a school trip
and they thought you were very cute and they would bring you toys
they would come and talk to you and bring you little stuffed animals to keep you happy
wasn't that nice of them

Franklin rides a bike
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings
did you climb the monkey bars at school
yeah
yes that's right you were taking turns
but Franklin had a problem
he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels
in the spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first
she practiced and practiced
she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other
Franklin's training wheels are right here
oh yeah he's not his bike must be off
out of the picture
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
maybe I think you're right
right
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
whoa
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
there's Badger too you're right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels said Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat
try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind
he felt unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for him she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park
he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got_to the third rung she fell to the sand below
