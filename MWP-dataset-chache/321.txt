and he'll say oh what did they talk about
can we tell about calling Kaylia this morning on the phone the very first time you called somebody
yeah
what'd you ask Kaylia

what did you ask her
didn't you ask her if she was gonna come over
yeah yeah yeah
I know this is the first time you ever called anybody I know
that is very cool
we'll have_to tell daddy
we'll say daddy this is what Matty did mommy dialed the numbers and then Matty called
now who did you talk to first on the phone was it Kaylia or Heidi that came on the phone first
Heidi answered the phone
and then did she give the phone to Kaylia

okay we'll wait outside
hey what is this here
what is this
on the bench
oh what is that
Cody broke his motorcycle
yeah
I don't know if that was Cody's
I think that was actually Rochelle's
it looks like Cody tried to fix it though
I don't know about that
do you think Cody can fix that
I don't think so either
it's probably very broken otherwise grandpa would have already fixed it right
so where do you want to sit
you wanna sit right here or do you wanna sit in the grass
what are these things over here
spider webs I don't want to sit next to those
let's sit in the grass
you wanna sit here
right here
you wanna sit on my lap okay
so do you wanna talk about your rock collection while we're waiting
remember you had the rocks at grandpa's the other night when grandpa was building the house
did we make all the rocks in a nice line
remember that time
hey what's that coming down the street
a big dump truck
that was a loud truck wasn't it
sure I have_to call grandma Sharon and tell her we're coming
hello grandma yes we're coming to see you in a couple days
do you wanna say hi to Matty
okay here
do you wanna talk to grandma Sharon
no you don't fell like it
you want me to talk to her okay
okay mom yep we'll see you Friday okay love you
you love Matty too okay I'll tell him love you bye
she said she loves you
oh my gosh what'd you do to that band aid
you're doing something silly yes you did
you're gonna leave it right there for Kaylia
Kaylia will say what is that
she'll be very surprised
did that rock get hurt
is that why it has a Harry Potter bandaid
you wanna use your own phone
where is cocoa
he's at the store
now what's he buying at the store do you think
he's gotta get some pizza
and Kit_Kat
a big big heavy rock
what're you gonna do with that big big heavy rock
just nothing
just hide this rock
what is on your rock that you chose
poop
no it's just little leaves
you're going around the block
okay wait for me
you're going around the block wait for me
oh what's this up here
a porch
I think they are stuck together
why yes they're supposed to be two little girls and they are they are stuck together
they made them out of the same wood
isn't that interesting
let's go
let's go around the block again
you wanna sit on my lap
okay you wanna sit on my lap and then we can still wait for Kaylia
well call her up and ask her where she is
oh my gosh she might be able to hear you you know
she's not that far away down the street she might actually hear you
do it again
what is this thing in your hair
ah a bug bugs
you're still calling for Kaylia
now there is something we did in North Dakota that Dr Weist might find interesting
remember we went to a place and they had somebody and they were drumming
did you like that part with the drums
no how come
oh I'll come with you
yeah but I have the tape recorder so I need to follow you
because
otherwise if you were talking it would not be able to tape record because we would be too far away
so how come you did not like those drums
because they were too loud
here come on come on I gotta follow you
I gotta follow my little bunny
what if my little bunny was running away and I did not know where he was going
I got_to stay with my little bunny
is this our little bunny hut or do we live in a burrow
oh so we live in a burrow but the little bunny sleeps in his own bed in the burrow
you're gonna get a rock for mommy bunny
oh thank you now what is this rock for
I'm supposed to catch it play catch with it maybe
so like this
oh you have_to be careful not to let it fall
what happens if it falls
I scream
ah
oh I see so that's a good idea we could cooperate if it falls you can catch it
okay you wanna sit right next to me in case it falls
you got an idea what's the idea
we're spraying is that for the rocks
oh gosh I'm getting so wet
hey I remember yesterday at the museum this was probably mommy's favorite part of the museum remember when you had to turn the thing and bring the clouds over
and then when all the clouds were together what happened
there was a big thunder storm
why do I well I think it was great
so what did they have in the thunder storm that was cool
real thunder it sounded like real thunder didn't it
it was probably a tape recording of real thunder I bet
I really like that part of the museum
well you know I didn't really go in the ant hill very much because remember the tunnels were very small I could not fit in there
Kaylia wasn't she in there with you
yes they do ants live in the ant hill
what if the opening was not big enough and I got stuck
what if I got stuck in one of the tunnels
that's true I might not know where you went
let's see you have some food
thank you is this ant food
bunny food oh yeah because you were just an ant yesterday
this is like when people lay out and they go to the beach we could pretend that we're at the beach
do you like to lay out when the sun is above us is that fun
you're sleeping at the beach
you can do it
you can no you cannot
okay if you want to stay outside why don't we make some food out here
you're what
you're playing Harry Potter
what is this part of the Harry Potter movie
when the what
wait wait wait when they mushed a girl
the part where they mushed a girl
when did they mushed a girl
oh when they were playing Quidditch
now tell me how did they mushed a girl
show me again
oh I see she was between them right and they mushed her
and then what happened to the girl
and then she fell that's right
what was the good part of the Quidditch match
when Harry Potter got the golden snitch yes
that was a very good part of it
so what is that
what could fit in there
you saw something that could fit in there probably
let's check
well what do you think
nope
what could fit in there probably
I have an idea
how about a piece of this
some of those
do they fit in there
here let me get you a better one
here xxx
you know I did not really notice the thing that grandma gave you
cool how does that work
what do you gotta do with that
what are you supposed to do with that
what's he doing
it's digging some sand
he's up on the stool
you just have_to go up there for a minute
just to jump oh my
how you gonna get back in
I don't know climb
there's your stool yep
you can jump sure
where you wanna jump to
right where the dump truck is
okay go ahead I'll move
look what happened
did you hurt your foot
what happened to your stool
I don't know
what happened to it
it just broke a little bit
you better be careful
we don't want you to get cut on it
I wonder why
we don't want you to get hurt on it
really don't step on it anymore
you could probably sit on it
because if you step on it again you could get your foot caught in there
see check it out this could poke you
I think we might actually have_to throw it out now
where's your other stool didn't you have two stools
where's the other one
this one what
that one is right there yeah
you can use it to dig right
oh okay so we could take this one down and put this one up
that's a great idea
here you go
excellent idea Boo because now this part is not broken
we can just throw this part out right
yeah
great idea
so now you have a stool again but don't step on it again
you just stand on it that's what broke it before didn't it
so you're gonna just stand on it go that way and then come that way
but aren't you worried that it's gonna break again
hey hey I don't want him to die honey
because he's a cute little grasshopper
you don't have_to mush him
there you go he's fine now
he's gonna live in the grass now
why he is
because he wants to live in the grass
he probably doesn't really want to live in the sandbox anyway
now don't jump off of it
you can stand on it I guess
I think that when you jumped off of it is when it had enough pressure on it to break
so tomorrow we're going to do two very special things
do you remember what they are
well one thing is in the morning when you wake up where are you gonna be now instead of a twinkle star
in the twinkle star room
you're going into twinkle star room
when's what gonna start
this
it's starting right now we're already doing it
afterwards you can listen to it okay
it is going it's just recording
it is going right now
why is it just recording
because that's how it does it
it's the same thing as when like Erin or Erika used to come over
we're actually going to have a new person to come over
do you know what his name is
come here I'll tell you
his name is Ryan
why is his name Ryan
it just is
yeah
he says he's doing some other things honey
let's go see where are we going
just somewhere huh
walk where he is well we can't go all the way back there
because he's like in the back woods
I have no idea why he is actually
but that's very prickly back there
we could just look at him yes that's a good idea
we'll just look at him but we're not going back in there
we don't even have any shoes on
he's gonna get all prickled up in there
he says it's very prickly
hey look what we found though
pick it up
what are those
oh you found some grapes in our backyard
daddy found grapes in our yard
that is amazing
no no it's back too far
we're still doing this Matty come on
yeah
yeah are you okay
run no we need to sit down to do this Matty
we can't be all over the yard
run
if we can't sit in the sandbox we're gonna have_to go inside to do it
because we have_to stay in one spot
we can't run all over because it won't record well
because it can't it can't record well if we're running all over the yard
and then we won't be able to hear it and then we have_to start all over again
what is that
so we were talking about tomorrow you're gonna be a new new twinkle star
who's gonna be in your class
grunk who's grunk
you silly one
actually in the afternoon we're going to do something fun too
we're gonna go canoeing
remember we're gonna go canoeing
who are we going canoeing with
you got an idea
oh that's a good idea
you have another idea
oh no that's not a good idea
because you're gonna hurt that little tiny bug
you don't want to hurt him
do I know where the money is let me check
there it is
yes
I don't know where the little bug went
I don't know
because he probably walked away or crawled
what do you think do bugs walk or crawl
crawl yeah
now what happened to poor Luke Matt
poor Luke he's all super sandy
poor Luke so you cover him with sand
you put the money with him
yeah
where is he
I don't know where is he
there's the penny and how about where's Luke
you padded him
wait you got the penny and you're gonna dig for him
I do see him
do I see him all the way
no I can't see his face
there he is there's Luke
I think it's like part of his equipment to help him fly
I think he pushes buttons on it and then he can fly and stuff
is he gonna be able to fly right now
do you think he can fly right now
there he goes
poor Luke what if somebody was looking for him
what if they were driving around in a vehicle Luke Luke where are you Luke
oh there you're okay but look you're all covered with sand
okay so this time I hide him and you gotta drive and find Luke
you're just gonna drive over him
on top of him
oh my gosh poor Luke
because they didn't see him okay
there he is
and then did they find him
okay so now he had to go through a big tunnel
I'm right here why don't you get me out please
they're gonna what
okay so they're gonna hide him and this time they're gonna see him okay
oh you want me to hide him
because that's just the truck
here you go
what if Luke kinda heard him driving by and he said wait wait wait
then do they hear him calling
what would Luke say when they found him
what
he's standing in the car
he's riding
can Luke drive this vehicle
does this open Matty at the top
no
can he sit maybe on here and drive or ride at least
you think you know
he can sit under here okay well that's a good place for him then
which green one
oh the green chalk
is he gonna go in that one instead
yeah okay
so this time they're gonna be right next to Luke and next time they're gonna find him okay
it takes him a little while to get in there yeah
because why
do you know what Boo I'm gonna have_to go in in a minute or two
do you see all the mosquitos around
I don't want to get bit up do you

let's go look at it

what should we do with that pumpkin
let's color it
remember what did we do with those pumpkins last year
you're trying to get that part off
okay
let's bring it in

how's this work
well you gotta put it on his hand

tell daddy what you did outside
to help daddy tell daddy what you did to help him honey
he moved them all and watered you know along and did all the trees
oh thank you
and then he turned the water off
okay
I see you walking slow yes I do see you walking slow
how come you walk so slow
it's how God made you
you can walk only slowly how about fast
let's say that God decided to make you walk very fast fast fast
now you can go fast
let's think about what we did since we had a tape before
because remember didn't we have a tape when we were at grandma and grandpa's
and then we found that when we went to the other grandma and grandpa's remember what did we do at grandma Sharon and grandpa Dan's house
do you remember where we went
nowhere
dinosaur place yes
what did you do at the dinosaur place
go on the train go on the
go on the roller coaster yes
and going on the flying bananas that's right
how about when we went to the zoo
what did you see at the zoo
lions and tigers and what else
why didn't we go through the part where they hyena was
I don't remember we didn't see the hyenas
we did or we did not
we did so we did see the hyenas right
why didn't we see the little baby
the little baby what
I don't remember that they did not have a baby hyena
did you want to see a little baby hyena
yeah they did not have too many baby animals at the zoo did they
there were just the little lions
and what were the little lions doing
okay so they were first sleeping that's right and one woke up and then he was walking up the daddy lion
what was he doing to try to make the daddy lion wake up
no I think you've had enough Chewies
I don't think so
but you've already had some Chewies
maybe a little later maybe
here we go
well that was not very nice
I think he's okay though
yeah you didn't really touch him with it
you did
are you okay Sammy
are you okay
I think Sammy is okay
uh oh he's got something on him though
hm what's this
look at this
he's got little things on him like as if he was outside
I'll have_to ask daddy if Sammy was outside
he's got little things on his fur
you think so huh
you think that's how God made Sammy
I don't know these look new
he's got little things from outside that's strange
these are things from outside little little burr things
I don't know how he would have gotten them
were you playing outside Sammy
I don't know I don't think so honey
you can rock on it but you can't really stand on it though because then
yeah but you could rock though right
we'll have_to show daddy this these things that I got off of Sammy's fur
I wonder if Sammy was outside
when were you outside Sammy
you wanna play a little bear game
before we go
how do we play the little bear game
you tackle
I just go on the bed
the little bear game is when you tackle on the bed
who did you play the little bear game with
daddy
I thought the little bear game was when we pretend that we live in the bear cave
oh just lay down under it
remember who did you used to hang out up there with and play bear cave game
can you show me what's inside here
oh I thought it was nothing but it is
chalk what do you do with it
do you want to draw with it
is that your chalkboard
I have a chalkboard too
what are you drawing
a mountain
it is looking like a mountain
that's pretty good sweety
you know what I noticed what were these from
your hands I know look at that
but when did you put those on there
it looks like your hands were dirty
or what do you think was on your hands that made these spots on the chalkboard
I'm not sure either
well see now what should we play with
you got these all for me
you got them all for you
where did you get them
oh actually
see that silver one came from the ground
what else does this remind you of that we also have at home
what does it look like
it's what
it looks like a shard of sea glass
it is called sea glass
now it's interesting that you got this at school
because you did not see that at the lake right you got this at school
where do you go to school at
oh yeah
do you like it
what'd you do at school today anyhow
why didn't he know where we were
when just now
um I don't know
maybe he did know where we were
so tell me what did you do today at school

oh you played with the rocks

there were
there was a whole bag
what did you have yesterday that made it easier to bring home all those rocks
what did you bring them home in
your pockets yes
you had very big pockets yesterday
yeah that's a nice one
we can see the silver one yep
you want me to see through it
let me see
you can kind of see through it not entirely
can you see through it
not entirely
it's kind of a cloudy isn't it
I think that it is
it's kind of scratched up
that's why you can't really see through it anymore
so what are these for
I'm not sure if Ryan's ever seen these
what are you supposed to do with these
you just have_to turn it on okay and then
now what
can you see stuff in there
it's silly because what
there's some on this side
okay so there's two ones you said
there's some on this side
and some on the other side I see

now Matty you saw it so what happens with Randall why don't I like Randall
because he's what
scary
why does it look like it's all broken up
it's an old piece of glass I think
maybe it used to be like a bottle and now it's just a little part left
um hum
maybe somebody broke it
they must have broke it because there's just that one little piece left

what else did I buy
um just this and this
this fits in here
that works good
what are you supposed to do with this thing anyway
you're supposed to put it on your back
you wanna see how sure
that was good
but where would you take a back pack like this
on a trip yes
am I going on a trip
um I could be going on a trip
oh okay sure
is this right
oh what was I going to put it on
the front

I think this should work
uh oh what's the problem with the back pack
it's too small
you're gonna go on a trip with me
well where should we go
okay good idea
you can what
unsnap it oh
the owl wanted to come too
and he fits in there pretty well too right
the hippo

there's not room for too much more is there
now where are we going on the trip again
okay you want me to try to snap it
so are we going to go where
to the beach
that's where we're gonna go on the trip
well what else do we need to bring to the beach
nothing else
are you gonna wear this in the water
you probably would
how about what are we going to use to dry ourselves off with
you think you have something we can dry off with
bunny
okay if I get wet I'll dry myself off with the bunny
is that a good idea
and this bear too
oh this one's gonna be for you when you get wet okay
so where's the water where's the beach
okay where's this beach at that we're going to
this way okay
what
oh do I wanna buy one more thing sure

the mommy dog spin well I'd get super dizzy honey
I'm sorry
well you can't oh she doesn't get to see it
no
what are those
you gotta ring him up
hafta what
what does that sound like
sounds to me like somebody had a song going there
does that sound like a song
you had some twos you had some threes
some fives yep
some twos where's some twos
uh oh now it says stop
because you couldn't put anymore numbers in
do I wanna play that oh maybe
you know Ryan doesn't know about our car
our car is making such a loud sound
it is what kind of sound is it making
what part of the car is making the noise
have you noticed that
it's the door when you open the door
the door
now you can tell Ryan the story
yeah let's hear the story
what happened to the guy
he hurt his leg
he had to go the hospital
yeah he had to get some canes at the hospital
so you are right that's a good story
so he was playing tackle football and he hurt his leg and he had to get some canes at the hospital
so how did he hurt his leg anyway what happened
they did
oh no
now how did you know about this
oh you saw him at the school with the canes
and then did he tell you the story of what happened to his leg
oh you just noticed because he had the cane
do you wanna eat your Chewies
remember we were gonna try to figure out about the shapes
what kind of shape does he have well let's see
these are so kind of strange
what kind of shape do you think he is
remember how daddy always goes maybe I'll test them and see if they're okay
should I test one to see if it's okay
I'll test the red one
oh look it's the same guy you had
isn't that the same one
yeah
so we got something very cool the other day
because we got new what did we get in our kitchen
new flooring
yes we sure did
so I thought these were kinda cool
actually Matty wanted the whole rest of the roll
what do you think we could do with this flooring
you don't know
what's something you could put on this flooring and that we could play with it
well I'll show you I had some ideas
because you have your rocks you also have these guys and then also maybe somebody could put some cars
what do you think about that
oh cars
why do we have_to make it stay there
does this help make it stay there
hm that's a good idea
it's still moving
so what else should we do then
to try to make it not move
put what
put glue well that's true we could glue it to the carpet that's not a bad idea
but then it would be here forever and ever and ever
how about can you think of something heavy that we could put on it so it won't move
like that
it's not moving
it is moving huh
how about anything else you can think of that would be very heavy
well maybe it doesn't matter if it moves
well I was thinking that we could drive cars
oh that did not go very well
how come that one did not work
you just have_to push that one yeah
which one's not going yet
oh it is going
yeah he's recording it
so this one goes and this one does not go very well
what do you think about this one
how do you think this one is gonna work
that's a fancy car
that goes
Ryan doesn't know the story
what did we do with this one one time when we had Erin over
what did we put inside this car
playdough
yeah tell him what happened to this car what'd we do
we had to what
we had to get it out yeah we filled the whole car with playdough
we got it out though didn't we
is there anymore playdough inside
why'd you fill it with playdough
you don't know
just did
I don't know
we just put a little bit in and then we filled the whole thing up
all filled up
what else could we put on there
this
