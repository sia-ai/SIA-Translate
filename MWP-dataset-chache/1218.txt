yes I do
yeah
uh huh
uh huh
yeah
yeah
yeah well I'm doing that and she's almost two so
yeah
yeah
well I would have liked to have waited but
I I wasn't gonna force the issue
uh huh
oh he
yeah she run well no but she runs that childrens' place
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm that's good yup
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm mhm
xxx mhm
yeah yeah
mhm
mhm
mhm
well it's partly
it's not xxx completely xxx good or bad it's partly about what your level of tolerance is I mean that that's part of the equation I mean
yeah sure
no I well
I don't I don't like I don't like it I wish it weren't happening but I'm also not willing to do what it takes
well I mean I am willing to do what it takes to reduce it but not to force it if you know what I mean
and and I think she
it is well I can go on and on on this topic it's like all I ever think about to be honest with you xxx
but the
I mean no that's an exaggeration but
because sleep is important that's why
for all of us
she doesn't have a sleeping problem because she sleeps right
I mean she barely wakes up to nurse
so it's not a question about her not sleeping it's a question about me not sleeping
no um what we did
is a couple of months well maybe like three or four months ago we got a single bed and put it next to our king sized bed in our bedroom
so she sleeps on that much of the night
and she
so she's farther away from me
and I either go down to her bed to nurse her
and and I try to just wait and see if she's really waking up to nurse or not
you know so
because sometimes she'll almost wake up but then she'll go back to sleep without being nursed
so it's also about listening carefully and waiting
but anyway sometimes I'll go down to her bed to nurse her and sometimes I'll bring her up to the bed and sometimes I'll have the energy to put her back on hers and other times she just stays in bed
I mean I'm not I I don't feel feel like I have an ideal situation
can I can I tell you about a book that I like though about this topic um
Elizabeth Pantley is the author
it's called the no cry sleep solution
and she is someone who has worked with um William Sears who writes all those children's books
um and I I like her approach because she's kind of like she's kind of like um
well it's hard to describe but you know middle of the
like if you need to sleep she's got suggestions on what you can do and yet she
recognizes there are lots_of people like me at least who want like no crying xxx
but want to sleep
so it's kinda like way
like possible ways of making that happen
and it didn't
I can't say that and it's also one of these things that's not a rigid plan it's more like an approach and suggestions and
stuff like that so it's not like you have_to follow a plan
yeah oh I think she's got some really good ideas and
apparently I mean
and I was also on an an email group of people who are following her plan and there's like eight hundred people on the list
so I don't follow it I mean I kinda like I just kind of abandoned it for the time being but but I but I think a lot of people are actually having success with her method
and a lot of people aren't too I mean I'd say that it's like one of those things
so
Furbur yes
yeah yeah
yeah
and the yeah go back yeah yeah
yeah
right
yup yeah
mhm think of
think through what you might wanna do
mhm
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
and that's hard for him
yeah
yeah oh
oh I have
you know that's exactly what has happened to me
I just started at a certain point I started getting insomnia
like inability to go back to sleep
and that just completely complicates things
and I think it was around when she was xxx age that that was happening to me too
um I can jump to the punch+line that one one of her major suggestions in that book is to
unlatch the baby when you're nursing
him to sleep
um before so that he doesn't actually fall asleep with a nipple in his mouth
and she's just kind of suggests that you do that religiously and repeatedly
you know until he kinda unlearns that's the only way he can fall asleep
yeah
yeah well that's
she's not saying that to do that
yeah sure yeah yeah
xxx okay now we can read bunny cakes
now we can read bunny cakes
bunny cakes
who's in bunny cakes xxx who's that story about
Ruby and who else
yeah
where's Max in that picture
he's sitting in a mixing bowl
silly Max
ha ha ha
let see ah we gotta make sure Mommy's your head it's on Mommy's mice
hm what's he have in his hand
ha
that Max
I can't believe he fits in the mixing bowl is he that little
he must be little if he fits in a mixing bowl
this is still March first
bunny cakes
oh here's some pictures of things
what do you see
yeah those are eggs
let's count those eggs
good counting Naima
one two three four five six eggs
that is a spoon
do you see where the mixer is
does that look like Mommy's mixer
it's Ruby's yeah that one is Ruby's mixer
oh cause there's two pictures here
I see the butter I thought Ruby uses butter to make the cake
I think that's the butter
yeah rubber spatula
I think Ruby uses the rubber spatula to mix the cake
and she also uses
the whisk
and oh there's the flour what's the flour in
in a red bag isn't it
with a number two on it
and I see some measuring spoons
and a measuring cup
Mommy has a cup like that
okay bunny cakes
it was grandma's birthday Max made her an earth worm what
no Max said Max's sister Ruby we're gonna make Grandma an angel surprise cake with raspberry fluff icing
what's he doing there
it looks like he's using a metal spatula to mix his cake
which is really just made out of dirt
that's actually dirt he's pretending to make a cake out of dirt
okay
Max wanted to help
don't touch anything Max said Ruby
you think she does I think he does want to help Ruby
does she want him to help
I don't think she wants him to help
you think he's gonna touch the eggs
he might what's Ruby doing with that egg
she's breaking it into the mixer
mixing bowl actually she's breaking it into the mixing bowl
she's holding on to the shells and letting the egg white and the egg yoke going into the bowl
what she making do you remember
yeah
but it was too late oops what happened
he broke the eggs
well you can't really fix eggs once you break them
you have_to throw if you break them and they go on the floor you have_to throw them in the garbage
maybe maybe Ruby will help Max clean that up and put it in the garbage
maybe they'll do it together you think so
yeah maybe Max and Ruby will do that
Ruby send Max to the store with a list that said
eggs
Max waned red hot marshmallow squirters
for his earth worm cake so he wrote red hot marshmallow squirters on the list
he wrote it with a red crayon except he's a little bunny and he doesn't really know how to write
he can't write he's a bunny but he's trying he's trying to write he wants to add red hot marshmallows squirters to the list so the grocer will give them to him
that's a kind of candy
the grocer could not read Max's writing
eggs said the grocer and he gave Max eggs
Max brought the eggs home to Ruby
oh I think they're in that red box
don't bump the table Max xxx but it was too late
what happened
he spilled the milk
yeah
she said don't bump the table Max but he did bump the table you see he's bumping into it right there and the milk bottle is falling over the milk is going on to the floor
oh oh who do you think is gonna clean that up
I think she's going to ask Max to help her clean it up don't you think
when you make a mess you should help clean it up right
Ruby sent Max back to the store with a list that said
milk how do you spell milk
right
great m i l k spells milk very good Naima
this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in a different way
he really wants that candy
Max hoped and hoped for his squirters but the grocer still couldn't read Max's writing milk said the grocer and he gave Max milk
what else is the grocer selling there
yeah
and what about over there
I think those are crackers
yeah
Max brought the milk home to Ruby
what did she do Naima
what did she draw
she drew a yellow line on the floor next to the table
there's a yellow line on the floor Max said Ruby
you can't step over that line
I think she's a little bit mad
he's bringing her the milk
but Max
he crossed over the line
oops what happened
what did he do
did he spill
he spilled the flour
oh oh over went the flour
Ruby got out her pencil and she
over with the flour clonk
Ruby got out her pencil
what did she write
she wrote flour how do you spell flour
f l o u r
flour
this time Max wrote red hot marshmallows squirters in the most beautiful writing he knew
he's using a crayon isn't he
Max could almost taste the marshmallows squirters
flour said the grocer and he gave Max flour
oh I think Max might be unhappy
that's the grocer
the grocer doesn't know that Max wants the candy because he can't read what Max wrote on the list
Max is just a little guy he doesn't really know how to write or talk properly
that's the door to the kitchen
these are trees over here and that's the door to the kitchen and there's Ruby inside holding a spoon
when Max got home there was a sign on the kitchen door
Max this kitchen is no place for you said Ruby
Ruby finished up her cake whose ears do you see outside the window
those are Max's ears
Ruby won't let him into the kitchen
he's outside looking in yeah
Ruby finished up her cake she baked it and cooled it and iced it with raspberry fluff frosting
she's using something to put the frosting on the cake
oh she gave him a spoon of the icing
he's eating some of the icing just a little spoon full
he's trying just a little bit
he's outside the window looking in
she's using a knife to put the frosting on the cake
that's a very pink cake
it needs something else Max said Ruby
birthday candles silver stars sugar hearts butter cream roses wrote Ruby
mean while Max had a brand new idea
he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer
what's he pulling behind him
yeah it's a red wagon there
maybe he's going to carry the food from the grocery store in the wagon when he goes home
what does the list say
it says birthday candles silver
sugar
and butter cream
and what're those
he drew a picture of red hot marshmallows squirters
on Ruby's list and ran to the grocer he could not wait
well he won't have_to wait too long

Ruby took a dollar from her wallet to pay the bus fair who's she giving the money to
the bus driver
oh here they're at the store do you know what the store is called
Roselinda's gift shop
in the window was a music box with skating ballerinas
isn't it beautiful Max said Ruby
thirsty said Max
you may buy a very very small lemonade Max said Ruby what's she giving him now
she's giving him her wallet do you think that's a good idea
next door in Candy's corner window were hundreds of vampire teeth
Max knew grandma would love a set of teeth with oozing cherry syrup inside for her birthday
okay
he bought them instead of the lemonade
two dollars please said Candy
Max wanted to make sure the teeth worked he put them in the teeth worked perfectly and Ruby had to take Max to the laundromat what're they gonna do with the laundromat
what're they gonna do what's this
a washing machine
and what's Ruby doing over here this is Max
this is Ruby's hand
I think Ruby is cleaning off his face with a washcloth
because he has mess on his face
soap cost a dollar the washer cost a dollar and the dryer cost another dollar
money down the drain Max said Ruby
hungry said Max
it was lunch+time
Max finished off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich two coconut cup cakes and a banana shake lunch costs four dollars one two three four
what does she have left in her wallet
yeah
money is running through our fingers Max said Ruby
they walked all the way back to Roselinda's gift shop without spending another penny
oh now what's happening in this picture
well Roselinda is telling Ruby that the music box costs a hundred dollars
but she doesn't have that much she only has a five dollar bill
and Roselinda shows her the blue bird earrings that play oh what a beautiful morning
they are on sale for four dollars
we'll take them said Ruby she's gonna buy those earrings for her grandma
she gave Roselinda the five dollar bill for blue bird earrings that looked like that and went to put pick out the wrapping paper
hey what's in the wallet now
it's empty
four dollars for the earrings one dollar
it is the wallet is empty there's no more money in it
Roselinda gives Max the change you take care of this dollar young man
where's she putting that dollar
in his overalls pocket
he has a pocket right in front of his overalls
then Max goes back to Candy's corner glow in the dark vampire teeth were half price
most people like glow in the dark vampire teeth much better than the oozing cherry kind said Candy
Max bought a set for one dollar
oh no Max said Ruby you've spend our last dollar
