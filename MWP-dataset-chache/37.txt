they rerun them during the day
hm
mhm
mhm mhm mhm
honestly Ross we don't understand why they do it
they think that they're doing themselves good by doing it
mhm
I don't think we agree
I think they're dumb
they don't have the vaguest idea what they're doing
a criteria that doesn't have a lot to do with their viewers
right
sorry
now why don't we figure out some other games to play okay
tv's not the only thing in life is it
honey you got some syrup on your coat
could I can I wash it off
it's real scary up there
well it's dangerous and you'll get scared
I know he to I know he called you a scaredy+cat
I told him to stop it
Ross
you wont what
you wont say it's okay
Mark says if he's just sorry I wont
in other words I wont accept the apology
very sorry say I'm very very sorry
that's good enough Mark
you say that's okay
okay then you go to your room with a spanking if you don't
he said it is okay if you're squushed
if there's any more violence here it'll be the end of the whole deal no more coloring no more attic no more fun
okay
no more s and no more koolaid

you said you br you almost cracked your neck
he said he almost cracked his neck
right
well wha that's pretty serious Ross
does Mark have does Ross have your mouth or my mouth
Ross has a beautiful mouth
I know xxx
it can't be either of us
it can't be that it's just too
oh I was hoping to claim it
it's too pretty
pretty mouth
why
what's wrong with her
really
who else talks too much
oh you mean on tv
mhm how about moose
not as bad
www
I have a clear example of a malapropism when he said
and what was happening was that he was pulling clothes from pajama drawer had already put on a pair of sleep shorts and finds the matching top to go with shorts
he said
burping at the table too
I see
come here honey
is it good to burp at the table
no it isn't
it's not polite Mark
how do they make life_savers
mhm
mhm

what was that Ross
huhuh
you mean the program and I wouldn't let you watch Knight_Rider
I thought it was too violent
oh
wasn't that A_Team
oh
oh maybe you're right
maybe you're right
okay but they don't really they don't really murder people on it now do they
no I didn't know
no I was afraid though
I was afraid it might be a_lot_of murder on that
there are some of those programs that have a_lot_of murder right
oh what do you mean it's been on a long time
it had been on for a long time you mean
and I hadn't let you see it
is that right
and you missed all the first parts of Knight_Rider
and then we let you see it right
and now do you think it's one of the best programs on tv
yeah
oh I see
it's one of your favorite
I see
okay
