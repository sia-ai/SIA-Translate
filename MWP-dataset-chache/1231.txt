truck has big orange and purple letters
it just what the truck looks like
why am I old

I'm jut putting away some dishes while I'm waiting for your pizza to be ready
may be it's almost ready though
let see if this is ready
hm it's pretty hot actually
I'm gonna cut it into pieces and then let it cool down
that's the best way to eat it
and it's a little bit cooler than it is now
because otherwise it might burn your mouth
that will hurt
oh pumpkin doodle
who began to cry
did you say he began to cry
who were you thinking of
is that so
try it
you don't want the sauce part

ah
I'm just having a spicy snack
you want it
you can have a little bit
because it's very hot
here's some lentils
Naima I have some delicious hummus here
hey hummus Mommy has hummus
you want some
with cracker maybe
smells
let's brush your teeth now Naima
why do they what
well so they don't run into the land and break the ship that's why
why because ships are for the ocean they're just for floating in the water they don't come on land
and sometimes if they hit the land they can break
and water can get on the ship and it could sink so they want to stay away from the land
and when it's foggy they can't see the land
and if they can't see the land they don't know where it is that's why fog horns help them fog horns help them know where the land is
come sit here little ship
so when it's really foggy all they have_to do is listen
and when they listen they can hear the fog horn and that tells them oh there's land there we better stay away
so whenever they hear it
can you face me so I can brush your teeth
they know to stay away
are you a ship
oh you better listen for fog horns then
oh boy
can you face Mommy so I can brush your teeth
Daddy is a fog horn
Daddy what's today's date is it the twenty first
yes it is the twenty first
it's August twenty first two thousand and three
we're on vacation
why are we on vacation Naima
to spend the time at Maine
that's a very good explanation of of a vacation
and because Daddy doesn't have_to go to work that means he can be with us and play with us every day right
are we gonna do uh get a yoga card after we do this tooth brushing and a sticker
yes
and we'll use the tape player we'll do all those good things
what beautiful teeth you have my dear
okay do you wanna have a little little sip of water

you wanna sit here while I brush my teeth

you wanna do that one
okay
let's see let's read what it is
this is called the side stretch not a very Sanskrit name
the side stretch
stand with your legs wide apart
actually you probably shouldn't do it on the here on the you should do it over there
right in front of your right here right here
right in front of your uh yeah that's it
stand with your legs wide apart
put your legs wide apart really wide really wide really wide that's it good
that's good no that's too wide
there that's good
take a deep breath in and stretch your arms out at the sides like this just like that yeah
like that that's good
actually we didn't finish it Naima
stretch your legs put your legs wide apart that's it
further further more more more good
arms out like this and then
you turn your feet towards the right side and that one too
that one too
both no both feet pointing that way
that one too
pointing this way
like that yep
and then you bend you stretch and you bend like that
that's how you do it
you wanna read a good library book tonight
which one
okay
oh my gosh Naima we're not gonna read ten books tonight
we are not reading ten books tonight Naima
you could pick a few
I think two and maybe three but that's all
Mommy
too many books
let's go to the bedroom to read them shall we
that's your favorite
oh
did I I wanna see your position what's the side stretch position can you show me
and then you bend your knee
oh
one knee
oh
and then the other one

okay you pick out the books
we'll go into the bedroom and we'll do some reading
I I know that you do like them a lot let's go to the bedroom
and read those books
yeah fog horns do tell ships to stay away Daddy was telling you about all about that wasn't he
should we tell the stories in your bed over here
read the stories I mean
oh there's a flap book too

I know you like flaps a lot
okay
you don't have_to wear it I'm gonna put it right there okay
and I'm gonna have a nice pillow to lean up against there for myself

do you wanna sit on my lap

remember which library this was from
right can I put this on your lap
we'll look at the book xxx whoops
I guess not okay there we go right there
whoa
I love you too
you're a sweet little mommy
I didn't know you were a little mommy
swikka dikka dameek
a swikka dikka dameek
oh
you're a sweet Naima
you're getting warm are you cold
we should put some pajamas on you
it's almost time for sleep whoa clunk sleep time
your nursie drops you off at the Nurney's house
oh_my_goodness
I never heard of such a thing
I never heard of such a thing
do you wanna wear your blue and yellow pajamas or your pink and orange pajamas
I don't know about any xxx pajamas
nursie pajamas
hm
aw you're picking up the nursies that you love
thank you should I put them back in my shirt
okay they're back in my shirt now
computer nursies
what are computer nursies
what
are you being silly Miss silly
shall we get pajamas now
you want the pink ones or the blue ones
I don't know about any nursie pajamas
you want a nursing shirt
Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts
not Naima
you don't have any nursing shirts
well I'll get the pink and orange nursing shirt for you okay
what d'ya mean no
you know what we never combed your hair after your bath
and we should put hair elastics in shouldn't we
oh okay I see there's a theme here
I think maybe it's time to stop taping
the seam
oh the theme
do you know what a theme is
a theme is kind of like an idea
and I said there's a theme here
and the theme was that you were talking about nursing a lot
xxx oh in the drug store at the
or whatever
I'm sorry Naima what were you saying
because Mister Fixit fixed it
but he's a funny guy Mister Fixit he fixes things in funny ways
I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again two hands please
oh
but instead he fixed it and now it says Dada
xxx funny Mister Fixit
um
you're having some of this too right
I don't know
yes
careful with the glass
olive oil
humor me
I just need something and I don't have butter
oh the plate
almond butter is healthy
yeah I'm gonna put that on
salmon
why did
I'm sorry Naima I wasn't paying attention to you
oh he does
but it's kinda mysterious they don't say why
they don't say what he does it actually sounds not only mysterious it sounds ominous xxx
Naima please don't wipe your hands on the table like that
I don't want you to do that are you gonna eat some egg white and egg yolk
yes
so that Sam can play with it
it's a toy boat isn't it
is it a toy boat
no it's a big boat somebody's in it while he's fixing it
oh
so that it won't sink
if a boat has a leak it might sink
it might go to the bottom
might go to the bottom of the ocean
I guess Philip's wagon was broken
maybe the wheel was broken
Mister Fixit likes to fix everything he touches practically
because I think he must have been using the wrong
he must have been using the wrong directions
when he was fixing it
he was supposed to fix it so it said Mama
but instead he fixed it so it said Dada
I think he probably was reading the wrong directions when he fixed it
like sometimes you need directions to fix things you need to read from a paper with directions
hm
like Babaji fixed his refrigerator
his refrigerator wasn't making any ice
and he fixed it
he had to read the directions for how to fix it
and then he fixed it
hm and hm
remember what was I reading xxx oh remember when I was trying to try out the backpack to carry you in
I had to read the directions
directions explain how to use something or how to fix something
mhm
when it first came when we first took it out of the box
be careful don't spill that drink okay
more
a smoothie is a drink
yeah I would eat more toast
I would basically eat toast until toast stops coming my way
do you want some help getting that out
you're trying to frost it
why don't I help you
mm egg yolk yum yum yum
it's still a little bit foggy out there Naima
did you hear the weather
I didn't
I mean yesterday it was overcast much of the morning and then it burned off
it was spectacular
a spectacular turnaround
I wonder if fog is a mosquito deterrent
hm
wishful thinking
I don't think so
mosquitos repelled by fog
could be the cool temperatures associated with it
hm
wonder if there's hot fog and cold fog
there are probably many different kinds of fog
but we don't know them
we would probably have fifty words for fog if we lived in Maine
and warm fog
and warm fog
yes
probably there's warm fog too
well you know there's a certain appeal to even though it's foggy at the moment
to
taking a day like this to go to Eastport
because
mhm no I was gonna suggest the same
it's sort of the urban entertainment
xxx all three blocks of it
well I think Lubbeck is becoming the more sophisticated
I don't know about that xxx you'd think that but I don't know why
urban renewal spot
The Home_Port restaurant and summer keys
Naima eat please don't please don't play with that
the kids in the xxx
those things have been those things have both been here a long time it's not becoming
oh yeah
with your fingers do you wanna use the knife
with your fingers sometimes you do that sometimes you can do that you wanna knife or do you wanna do it with your fingers
or you wanna
oh you already did it I think
okay
why'ncha eat some
you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it
mm
is it really shorter to go on the ferries
oh it in terms of amount of time no it's probably shorter to go the other way cause I think if you drive to Eastport it's probably about an hour
from here
yeah
it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know if you go by ferry I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twenty five minutes that's an hour and a half plus the drive time so
it's probably longer to go that way
not that it'll be very spectacular that is really one of the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries
well the thing is if we drove there and then took the ferry back by then it might not
oh good idea
babe
we could get mustard
oh dear hm
you know we still have oh
you talking to Dad I'm sorry
it's not properly calibrated
that's alright I'll I'll
I haven't calibrated my slice thickness
yes baby xxx
what is it
say that again
oh what mosquitos the fog might do
I don't quite understand the question but I think you're saying what the what might the fog do to mosquitos
I think that's what you're asking
hm
cause I said maybe that's
well Mommy thought maybe mosquitos don't like fog so that the fog will keep them away
Mommy was more hoping that than thinking that
I think Mommy was engaging in something called wishful thinking
yes
that's called wishful thinking that's when you wish something's true
even if it's not
I don't think toddlers are supposed to have that level of reasoning yet
because toddlers are toddlers what are you doing
hey what are you doing with the
d'ya want more
smoothie Boobaloo
you can have more smoothie if you want
does Miss Boo want more smoothie
good good
that's a good smoothie isn't it Naima
and you have lots_of egg and egg white Daddy might eat some
Daddy's gonna eat some xxx mm
oh that's for Daddy too
are you gonna feed me
mm
good
you taking turns eating with Daddy
xxx yes I did Naima
mm I'm chewing it and I'm swallowing it
and I'm washing it down
just like Naima does
I don't want egg yolk thank you Naima you should eat it
you can have egg yolk
you should eat it
it's good but it's for you
yeah I'll eat the egg white
mm I like egg white
you like feeding Daddy
um xxx it's a little too close to the edge
mm Daddy likes egg yolk really a lot
it has protein in it
that's the dirty little secret about egg whites
you did thank you
right to Daddy
oh that one
okay thank you
a crumb of egg yolk not a piece of egg yolk
now your turn
no it's your turn nah
I want you to eat it a little bit more now
Daddy's gonna watch while Naima eats
I am
cause I like protein it's healthy for me
I think the other thing is
are you done Boo_Boo
yes
oh I heard a burp
why'ncha finish the smoothie that's in the glass
the placement of words in question formation is occasionally correct now
oh
mm that was good thank you
okay I believe you
thank you
it's moothie the smoothie is moothie
let's take let's take your bib off and then let's clean you up
it's moothie

pajumming
you hit the ball and the panda bear throws it to Sleepy Bear

he pinches his mommy
he's pinching you I see that now
you could say
if you're his mommy you could say don't pinch me Sleepy Bear that doesn't feel good
you have_to teach him Naima
'cause if he's a toddler bear he needs to learn what the rules are and how to be with people like you don't pinch people and you don't hit people
you don't hurt people
what're you gonna tell him
right you still can say it in a nice way but he still needs to learn
