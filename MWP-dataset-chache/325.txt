when did that happen
do you remember when he changed his name
no
a couple weeks ago
all of a sudden one day what did the teacher say
no
yep I do know who Nancy is
she's very nice
Chris is too
so one day Chris came in and said his name is not Vinny anymore
why do you think she still calls him Vinny sometimes

what'd you do at church
oh you sing
sometimes he likes to go where the Sunday school place is because that's where some toys are because church gets kinda long right
what do we do in Sunday school

yeah sometimes
sometimes you might want to do that
now you were telling me about the play you were in
and was that was that in your church
yeah that's when you were the sheep
now what what did you have_to say again
I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing
oh oh I just remembered Ryan doesn't know what movie you went to go see with daddy
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
oh really
did you have_to close your eyes
really
did you get scared
no
you're pretty brave
yeah I thought so
what else happens in the Harry Potter movie do you remember
there's definitely scary spiders and a snake what happens in that movie
there were also scary bugs in it
yeah
see I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing
why
oh Elisah's Secret
well you could just tell him about Elisah's secret
that was a movie we saw before Christmas
oh yeah
yeah that's a great movie
what happens about Elisah's Secret
it has what in it
oh poachers
what'd they do
oh no
they wanna shot them
yeah
okay
so what else happens in Elisah's Secret
they got poachers and
the what dance
the woodgie dance
that is a silly name
they do that at the end of the movie don't they the woodgie dance
do you know how to do the woodgie dance
sometimes
can you show me
oh that's okay
so what is Elisah's Secret anyways
em mm
who is he
oh yeah
you got a_lot of friends at school don't you
no
wow
you must be a pretty nice kid huh you have so many friends
oh yeah
Roman
Ryan knows Roman
I just remembered something about Roman
tell Ryan about what you did on Saturday night
what was Roman at our house for
you had a sleepover
oh wow
what'd you do
what did you and Roman do when he was here
do you remember
well what was one silly thing that happened when I said it's time for sleep
do you remember that
where did he keep going into when I kept saying no no no don't go in there
um hm
into the closet
yeah
why did he
really
in the upstairs closet
binoculars
no what're they for
wow
can you see me
yeah
what am I doing
you can see me
so did Roman sleep here all night
wow
not today
did you eat breakfast in the morning
yeah
oh I do
I like those
yeah
oh yeah
so yep Roman stayed over
did you guys watch a movie
what movie did you watch
oh I think it was Land Before Time Secret of Source Rock
you told me a little bit about it but I still don't know all the way
oh jeez
um hm
I'm a little bit afraid of meat eaters
you're not
you are brave
so yep Roman stayed over and then what happened in the morning
did did he wanna go home
do you remember he didn't wanna go home right
but then he had to go home because where did we have_to go
yep
you had to go to church
no
do you
oh okay
wow
that was a good one
how did you learn how to do that
that's pretty good
can I see one more
wow
that was a really good one
um hm
you must've been practicing
you know I was just remembering when Roman came over and he brought a very cool toy
do you remember that flashlight
well how did you use the flashlight then
no
wow
so you had to put the different colors on
they were
really
that is interesting
so you have_to put the little cover on the flashlight right
and then what do you do with the flashlight
do you have_to turn the lights off to see it
wow
oh your own flashlight
I think I put it in there honey I think it might be in your little ah container there
do you wanna show Ryan what's in that orange bag
oh boy
oh wow
tyrannosaurus
a spike tail okay
Ceratosaurus I think it says
a Spinosaurus
a pontasaurus
oh boy a
a Velociraptor
a Velociraptor
this guy
you know his name you knew how to say this the other day
what's he called
oh you want Ryan to say it okay
I might need a little help
a pera
oh you say that good
oh that's a really long one
Pachycephalosaurus
what was the game we were playing with these yesterday
do you remember
um hm but what happens in the dinosaur
so what'd you do at school today
you had a pretty good day
well that's good
is that your kazoo
oh you already showed it to him
oh yeah he hasn't seen how this is
oh yeah what is this
caterpillar oh okay
whoa look at that
xxx add and subtract
can you dance like that
what is that Boo
look he says one plus one is what
so can you press two
and do they have the second one there
we'll just do one more and then maybe we'll play a game
nine minus seven so this is nine okay
now I'm gonna take away seven how many are left
two again
how come it's two again
nine minus seven is two
you got it
you gonna turn it off
now when did we get that
oh Allison gave it to us actually Angie did
oh is Angie your friend
she's my sister she's your aunt
oh your aunt okay
well you have a nice Aunt then huh
you know what I think we should do today Matty
I think we should have a tea party
cool idea
what do you think about that
I haven't had a tea party in a long time
cool let's do that
do you know where's the rest of them Matty
remember when was the last time you played with those
uh huh so what'd you and daddy do with them
oh okay
so the other ones are sticky from jello can I look
maybe daddy washed them
can I check and see
did you make jello then
oh you got it at the store
that's pretty neat
so I kind of forget how you have a tea party
you know I don't really know either because wasn't it you and daddy who played
how do you have a tea party
why don't you come over here
you put water in the cups do we use real water
just pretend okay
so you put water in the cups what else do you do
so let's see now whose plate is whose
I would like some water please
oh good I was so thirsty
that's some good water
I don't really want water can I have soda please
oh I think this one
you know I think I want soda too
can I have some soda
that's some good soda
so what do people usually eat at a tea party
you don't know
do they eat these
you're just gonna eat it yourself huh
well what do people usually have at a tea party what would be good to eat do you think
bears
whoa this is a crazy tea party
tea party's over
well let's see now I don't want any bears what other things do you got at this restaurant
the last thing you have is gumballs you don't have anything else
do you have any french fries
I'd kinda like some french fries
oh thank you
that's a good french fry
and for me what else do you got
ah what's that
a wolf to eat
well I am pretty hungry okay I'll guess I'll eat the wolf
what are these anyway what are these for
oh but what are they for what would you say good for what
okay so seeing stuff that is very far from stuff okay
what do you see
oh I see daddy coming home
do you want to tell Ryan about the game how you do the pet shop game
okay
you wanna show him that game Chutes and Ladders
let's see what one is it
let's see this one right here
it's the bottom one okay
this looks like a pretty neat game
is that the right one
okay
can you explain how you play this game
okay
okay well can I just decide where I'm gonna be can I just decide that I'm gonna be right here
how do you know where to go
okay you have_to start right here and then and then there's only two people so what'd we do now
the spinner oh okay
well what about Ryan playing
or is he gonna be this one
hey thank you
which one did you just give Ryan
a who's in that one
okay now what
actually you know you're very lucky because when you start here and you hop to one you get to go up here up the ladder
how come that girl gets to go up the ladder
oh because she did a good job
yeah she was carrying those and then she had to go down the chute
how come she had to go down the chute
okay now what do we do you already went so now what happens next in the game
now I spin
I got a one too
so now I'm right here and you're right there do I push you over
no
what am I supposed to do
just stand next to each other okay
Ryan's turn
oh I got a one too
so do I go all the way up this ladder
okay
we're all on the same spot
okay now what happens
now these get tricky because you got_to go in a certain direction so this would go how about I count each one one two three four
now what's happening to the little girl in this picture
is that a good thing
is it my turn
what happens if the dog's licking you
yeah you get germs from the dog
one two okay so I'm behind you right
oh I got two too
there we go
you were counting the squares but you got_to count these squares so one two
where are you going big guy
you were right here you just gotta go one two just follow the squares
you're right there with the boy
is he getting real small here
what's going on here
he's getting real bigger there
which one what
oh wait it's my turn
which one will people get that's your question huh
I got the four one two three four
look we're together
here will you spin it for me one time
alright I got two one two
I'm on the dog again
okay your turn again Matty if you still wanna keep going
alright now what
you're counting the squares but you gotta count them across so it's one two right there
six one two three four five six
oh no what happened to me
so what happened in that picture
he fell on the ice and then
oh yeah
actually that's interesting that's actually from Allison my other sister
so this one's from Allison and that one's from Angie
wow what do you do with that
what do we sometimes do with that puppet
we do races are we still playing this game
you were just like running the races
oh I got six
where am I
oh wait hold on Ryan's supposed to go
okay what'd you get Matty
six
check out that number again
oh yeah okay
you're kinda counting the little actually they're called rungs on the ladder but actually you have_to go this way so you were right here so one two three oh no
no he got here he got past that one some how
I don't know who do you think might be a winner
I don't know it's too early to tell
it's up to you
what do I have_to do I landed right there what do I have_to do
I have_to go down there
so how come that boy has to go down the slide and he did not do good job
what's he doing there
now you had asked me if we were going to play the whole game do you want to play the whole game or do you want to do something different
I don't know
well there was something interesting last night that was almost like you got a bunch of new presents
what did you find in the basement
books in the basement
no I didn't bring the bunny book
it's still in your mailbox I bet
that's okay we got the other remember we have the other one in the bigger book so if we really wanna read it tonight we can just read the other version right
but yes where did those books come from besides the basement
um hm I don't know if he knows who Katie and Cody are
no
are they your uncle
is Cody your grandpa
remember what is he he's your
cousin
now I was just thinking about something that Ryan probably does not know about and that is the other night you had that very interesting dream
about Land Before Time do you want to tell Ryan what happened in your dream
it was a very interesting dream
he woke up in the morning and he said Momma I had this dream
what was in the dream
tell about the dream
dinosaurs
and what was interesting about the dinosaurs though in your dream
they go to the Great Valley but you told me about how you were in the dream
you were a Longneck
that is so cool
and then how about some of your other friends
you forget which one is Sarah well you told me it was Ricky
you don't remember who's Sarah's daddy I think it was Casin or Jackson I don't remember
Casin
it was a very interesting dream yeah
now you know you told Ryan about going to get your new little toy at the at the at the you know your new little kazoo did you tell him what else you saw at the museum
snow
now what was it doing
oh okay
they have play there
oh a play there that's right you went and saw a play there
I don't really know what the play was about though what was the play about
oh so the play was about snowflakes
and then you also made something there too
what'd you make
oh you got_to make a snowflake
how'd you make it
what did you use
you forget well was it made out of real snow
what would happen if it was made out of real snow
melt
you know I don't think we've seen Ryan since we've been since you and I and daddy went to the Nature Class
remember that day and we made some things for the birds and animals
what'd we make there
well one thing I'll give you a little hint it's something that was kind of silly because we can eat it too for breakfast
cereal
what'd we do with the cereal
we put it on string um hm
so we put it on the string and then what'd we do with it
okay
what does it say
oh can I give you a hint
it's June
June ninth
can you guess how old he's gonna be
how old are you gonna be
ten
three right now
so then you're gonna be six right
oh just four yep
you're getting very big huh
we did maybe about a month ago or so we were talked about your birthday and we were thinking about whether you would have wanted to have a party where people came over or maybe just take a good friend and go to the zoo
what do you think you would like to do for your birthday
so you were thinking that if a lot of people might think about coming to the party
and you think that only one really should come
you don't want a_lot of people arguing about the toys that people are playing with
well if you only got_to invite one friend what would you do
you're gonna invite Marissa well that would be nice
that would be nice
is that a plan
how are we gonna let Marissa know about it
oh so you have a_lot of good ideas
so you think that she would be thinking about coming and then you want to get a map so that you can know where her house is and then you're gonna bring her the card
sounds like a good plan
you don't think it will be a day when you go to school
it won't be it will be after school ends
you usually finish school in the middle of May and then comes June so you'll be out a good while before your birthday is
what is that
whoa I should move I don't know if I want to be by that
what kind of things can this pinchie do
well why don't you tell Dr Weist what the pinchie can do
what can the pinchie do
it could or how about this can it pinch this can it hold it
let's see here
is that someone what's going on with that noise outside
hey thank you
I don't think he'd want that
can it pick stuff up
he look at that that's cool
well what'd you think
it seems like it could be a what what do these seem to be maybe
what are those things it starts with an M
we call them
metal sticks
what attracts metal what are the things that can pick up the metal
remember you got a whole box of them what are those called
magnets yeah
so you think that's what's going on there's a magnet here
I think what it is is that when you grab it here let's show your nose in here so we can talk about this okay
all it does is it just mushes the thing like this brings these little arms together and it mushes the things
that's why you can stick them in
well you know I was thinking something very interesting happened yesterday morning with our garbage
do you remember what happened with our garbage
it fell over
how'd it fall over
by all the wind but then so our garbage fell over and then what ended up happening to all our garbage
oh he did that was nice
you're right he throws the garbage
have you seen how that works
yeah
it's very interesting
so it picks it up and it picks up the garbage can but then it puts the garbage can back down
what happens to the garbage
okay
yeah we were waiting looking out our window to see what would happen to our garbage because it had blown over and the man helped us just like Matty said
that was nice that he helped you huh
the Thomas video
oh that's in the other room you can tell
that was such a funny thing
one weekend we went to a party and they were showing the Thomas movie and then we went to somebody's house for dinner and they were showing the Thomas movie
I don't even think Ryan's ever seen the Thomas movie though
no what's it about
trains
um hm so what happens with the trains
pretty much
so there's a mean one named Diesel and he wants to blow up all the trains
what do the other trains do
what do they usually do in the movie the trains
they pretty much just work and drive around
have you ever seen a train before a real one
you heard it
we heard one once
have you ever been on a train
where were we going
um hm you were small then so I don't know if you remember much about going on that trip you were only two
do you remember anything about going on that train trip
do I remember
I remember that one time you screamed really loud and this lady screamed because you scared her
remember that
she thought that you were like really sick or something but you were just goofing around and you screamed
why'd you scream
I don't know why did you scream
just to goof around yeah I think so
so when Ryan leaves can we watch the Thomas movie
maybe but I have_to go back to work though remember to go get a poster
what'd you think
I do not really want Squibber on my head please
well what should we do we only have a couple more minutes
what would you like to play with
you wanna build the dinosaur real quick okay
oh okay well should we take out the pieces
is that how we usually start
is it what a Longneck
it's supposed to be a brontosaurus yeah
does that fit in there
how'd you put those pieces in
yep you got it you got it you did it
so which piece does it connect
it looks like it you're right on I think
let's see here
oh maybe too big
oh you got an idea
maybe we should try it on the floor first because I think trying to build it up is actually harder
because what's this part
okay so where might the leg go
do you see a place where the leg could go in this puzzle
like one of these two maybe
I think well does it fit
let's check oh I see sometimes what do you have_to do to the piece
turn it around
turn it around okay now what else
you're gonna build him standing up okay but it looks like he needs another leg
where's another leg
sure
you'll like that better than his first idea which was that you guys were gonna play that chase game
yeah you decided not to because then your daddy's back would hurt more yeah that could happen
so I wonder if this one might be a good one for a leg let's see
I found it I found it
hey that's pretty neat
now he can stand up
is it standing up right now
what's gonna happen to this
where's his head
does he have a head at all
that is a small part
yeah what part could that be for
look at that does that fit in there
what is the thing about the brontosaurs they have long necks but they also have long what
yeah so I wonder if that could be a tail part
are we missing any pieces too
this is a tricky puzzle do you remember who'd you get this puzzle from
is this gonna go in there somewhere you think
there's gotta be something that goes in the middle
because there's a big whole
maybe this dinosaur does not have a stomach
that would be a silly dinosaur huh
oh maybe Ryan has an idea
oh maybe this could work look look look
is there another piece that can go on the other side then
how about that one can that one work
hey you got it good job
now where does this one go you think
you wanna try a different piece
you wanna do something different
okay we'll work on it some other time
it's a tricky puzzle I think
it's a neat puzzle
well you know we actually did get a new movie this weekend that we rented remember that has to go back in a couple of days remember it's Land Before Time and the
the mysterious
island okay what happens in that movie
well it's so interesting in the beginning they're in their homes and who comes and eats the food
the leaf gobblers
the leaf gobbler
the leaf gobblers come and eat all the food and what do the dinosaurs have_to do then
go to a different island and break up all the sweaters
why do they got_to do that
just kidding I see
because what
are you making up a silly thing about the sweaters
well I think that we might need to put that last piece away don't you think
yeah you don't want to lose them
hey what is this
oh this is the information about it
if you flip it over that's what it says
who usually would hide in the cushions
cats yeah or maybe a little boy
does your cat hide in the cushions
why you wanna rip it
yeah but this is the thing that grandpa Dale wrote about your special puzzle
you don't want it
what if we forget what kind of dinosaur it makes
okay so you would just watch a show and figure it out
alright okay so if you really don't want it I just don't like to rip things up usually that seems kind of mean
I don't know why was the daddy hiding in the cushions
do you think Grandpa Dale can hear you
who's the only one that probably knows that you're ripping that up
Ryan and you and me and anybody else
God probably maybe
and Jesus but grandpa Dale is not one of those people right
should we call up grandpa Dale and tell him
grandpa Dale uh uh I have_to tell you something
here you tell him
you're sorry you ripped the comic up
well why did you rip it up
you didn't want it anymore okay
well did you have a good day at school Matty
pretty good
tell me about shape man
Ryan doesn't know how the song goes the shape man song
no how does it go
oh you do not
now what's shape man made out of
well what kind of shapes
semicircle
yeah
and he has a circle named after him
sure Samicircle right
Samicircle Samicircle
oh a space shuttle cool
what do space shuttles do
oh I did not know you remembered that
why do you think it crashed
I don't think it wanted to crash
that is sad
did you know there were people in there
yeah it wasn't just a space shuttle it had seven people in it
it is not good that it crashed it is very sad
they all died yes
no kids they were all adults they were all astronauts
all the what
all the astronauts died yeah it seems like maybe it burned up when they were coming back from outer space
yeah that's very sad I wish that did not have_to happen
why because we have_to hide your face
we have_to hide your face now
where'd you go
oh there you are I lost you for a second
it has been so cold out hasn't it been
do you wear your boots when you go outside
yep that's probably a smart idea
I don't know I'm not even sure it was going today
oh yeah it's still going see look look look that's how much is left that tiny tiny bit at the end
once that is all finished and there is no more on this side then it's all done
what should we tell Dr Weist before it finishes
yeah
okay what else
what would Dr Weist be interested in
I think he likes he likes to hear about what you did at school
what did you do today anything fun
you what
oh my well today was a strange day for Matty at school because they had no lunch
no lunch
they had no lunch
they did oh what'd they have for lunch
rice and what
you can eat chicken now
Lilly can eat chicken now how come she could not eat it before
how do you know she can eat it now
now do you stay inside all day when you're at school
oh you go outside
is it cold out when you go out
yeah what kind of things do you do when you're outside
you make funny faces
oh my what were you doing when I picked you up today
so Lilly was pulling you and you were pulling Marissa
I did see that and what did Marissa say just before you left
she said Matty goodbye
no remember what she said
she said Matty she would like to what tomorrow
can you play with me yep that's what she said she said can you play with me tomorrow
and what did you say
um is there any extra oh we gotta think of something really good to say to Dr Weist oh um um um
you wanna tell him what we're gonna do on Friday night
and remember what it has to do with it has to do with ice and we go and watch people on the ice
oh well close
hockey what happens at the hockey game
oh yeah people hit the puck with their stick and then what happens during the middle when it's time when they're taking a break
what comes out onto the ice
the Home Depot
close it's a Zamboni
what does the Zamboni do
oh what does the guy on the Zamboni do sometimes
throws out presents onto the ice
that's pretty neat
I don't know then I think he could throw them pretty far though he probably won't throw them on the ice
what'd the hockey players wear
do they wear like sneakers
oh ice skates okay
and what do they try to hit the puck into
into the net
yep it's just about done
so they do they hit it into the net and then they say great job and they get a goal
but you know what there's a part of it where somebody might do something called what
what happens if you trip someone for example
well let me put away my crayons real quick and then I'll see
let's see what'd you got
oh because I like to draw sometimes
do you like to draw sometimes
sometimes
yeah okay
do you wanna grab your books
did you just get these today
oh boy
let's see were you surprised to see those books Matty
I know I went and picked them up right away
let's see here
now we probably won't read them now we'll read them at home or maybe in the car
where are we going tonight
Mike
Mike and Kara's
you're going to their house tonight
what're we gonna do there
that sounds like it's gonna be fun
we're gonna read them in the car I think
oh boy
wow this will be a great book
so Martin's Big Words and we have Baby Gets in Trouble
that looks like a good book
what's going on with David here
where is he
yep
in time out
yep
do you think he likes it
no
alright do you wanna play with some of the things
Ryan set up so much stuff
you can play with anything that you want
I got alota stuff
I thought I thought these were kind of neat these little dogs right here
do you think they're kinda neat
okay
do you want do you wanna start with the slides
okay
okay so what are we gonna do
you're gonna start the slides okay
oh that's a super funny idea
oh my
oh the bear fell over
try the dog see if the dog goes down
oh my
yep
do you think dogs really like going down slides
huh
you think so
you don't know
let's see what he would think
I like going down slides
do you remember that book we were reading last night about Donald Duck goes to the play+ground
yeah he'd just keep saying wee I know you kept saying wee right on all the pages
that was funny
you know Ryan doesn't know what we did last weekend
I'll give you a hint
it had to do with a car and driving
what town did we have_to drive to
we drove to Crystal Lake
wow
it's super far from here
who lives there
you went to go see grandma and grandpa
was that fun
what'd you do there
do you remember what you did
well who did we go really visit
who did we visit for real
do you remember my sister we went to really see my sister
do you remember how come we went to visit Angie
huh
because she was sick yeah
is she feeling better
um hm
this is very interesting
this is a pretty cool cash register
I never played with it before
how does it work
I'm not even sure
but I know I want to buy some of that ketchup
what does he have_to do to buy the ketchup Matty
huh
does it make any noises
I don't know
oh yeah
I think I probably need some milk I think that's milk
how much is it
because I'm not sure if I have enough money
two dollars
oh I have enough money
how about this this will be my two dollars
thank you
I think yep I think it goes through this one
oh my
this is so interesting
hey can I I decided that I like chocolate milk better than other kinds so can I buy the chocolate milk too
how much is the chocolate milk though
how much is it
