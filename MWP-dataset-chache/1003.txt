okay fine
real good I'm gonna take this out for you okay
want me to set this over here
maybe in a few minutes you can have some more
okay the worst about this coming out
it doesn't hurt but the tape okay
the tape sometimes sometimes pulls you see the hair in around here
sometimes the tape pulls on it
okay and that's the only thing that hurts
you know how when you have a bandaid on and you take it off it sticks to you
and sometimes the bandaid hurts worse than the cut it's huh when it comes off
what just going to what
what's that
that's the bandaid okay
and so you hold still
yeah right where it is it's going to be a little bit of a cut
okay that's why we need the bandaid
okay and you can set it right back down
that's an awful little arm for it isn't it
that's the way you hold still
you okay
you want me to stop and rest for a minute
or you want me just to finish and get it over with
can we just finish
okay you can all done
it's not too many kids who wake up with a smile on their face
you know that don't you
you must be pretty special that's what I think
yeah
you want to start getting dressed
yeah
you sure
you sure you want to go home
okay
if you're sure
I'll put the rail down
have you your clothes
you get dressed sitting right here on the stretcher okay
you stay right up here and get dressed
and then you can go home in a few minutes okay
okay does that hurt
okay
does it hurt any more
terrific
okay now let's put this thing on
like I had to wear when I had Jessica
they like you to wear their own pajamas
I don't know why
they just do
you're a little scared
mamma is going to be with you
I'm a little scared when I go to the hospital too
and everybody tells you what they're going to do
and that makes it less scary right
no
no that arm band is just part of this
it's going to be a little bracelet
we'll take it off after we go home
you want to keep it on forever
hey how about taking your boots off
okay you don't want to get your nice hospital bed all dirty with your boots
and then how about taking your tummy bothering you
okay
you really didn't like that prick in your finger did you
oh_my_goodness
just get ready
because Doctor Strom is going to say
where is Paul_Parsons
I don't know
maybe when you grow up you'll be able to wear your own jammies in the hospital
maybe when you are all grown up you won't have_to wear hospital jammies
when you come to the hospital maybe they'll change
things do change in the hospital
now this goes
this says rodeo
says rodeo
on the front
it's a little uh big
I don't know
I don't know what we are supposed to do with your clothes

I see a five on the xxx
and we'll come back and get them after
so how do you feel
okay
no
that thing tickles under your arms
just in xxx
you're going to go to sleep
and then you won't feel it tickle under your arms
leave your undershirt on
uhhuh
you hate that thing
xxx very uncomfortable
you'd like to wear your own jammies wouldn't you
that would be better
I'd like it if you could wear your own jammies too
they probably would because all the ones in the hospital look like this
they're more like your night shirt
see they're not really like uh jammies
they're more like a night shirt kind of thing
xxx boy's room

I hear Doctor Strom but I'm not positive
oh_my_goodness
it says rodeo
that's where cowboys race and bucking broncos and horses
that says rodeo too
the star says rodeo and the circle with the rope says rodeo

no big ones
because Jessica
yup
if you share it with her
with your little baby sister
we should have brought a safety pin
that's what I wore for a whole week
how old were you when you first got your ear fixed
it must have been three years old
and now you're four and a half right
yeah
what
oh no critters
no you're much too brave to cry for a silly blood test right

well you remember when you go in to have your tubes xxx there's any big because I'm not allowed to go in that xxx
with you
I can go everywhere except for in that room because Doctor Strom will be in there
you'll be sleeping

I bet daddy's taking Jessie to the baby+sitter and going in the car
I bet at night it goes off when you're sleeping here all xxx
no you better not
in a little while when Doctor Strom gets his flat tire fixed he's going to come in and listen to your heart and probably look at your ears like he always does right
he always wants to see your ears
not on Saturdays he doesn't look in your ears
not on Sundays
but on Monday he does
think she's grown
what
why are you so sad sweetie
that's right
we'll have_to buy you a new one
did we did we lose blankie too

I wonder if somebody another child found him
and took care of him
do you think so
mhm
huh
I don't know
it's pretty black up there
oh yeah
you mean we're right next_to another building
I don't know why they put a window there though

this building was built first
and another building got built second
next_to it

I'm going out now
you're going to stay right here

it's true
kids around here huh
no kids in grampa's hospital except maybe you
is grampa's room nicer than this or not so nice

grampa's hospital is a brand new hospital
everything looks sort of fancy you know
pretty
this is kind of an old hospital
but it has nice doctors and nice nurses
huh
what are you scared of
what do you feel scared about
you just don't know
you just feel a little bit nervous in your tummy
well you know what
that's why I'm here
because I wouldn't want you to be sitting here feeling scared without me to be right here right
that would be sort of sad
that's why mommies get to come
to stay with their children
and for daddy to come
or both of us could come
why soon we'll all be done and we'll go home
and you won't feel scared any more
will you
I'm always scared when I go to the hospital too
when I went to have my babies I was a little scared even after xxx
you know that
even after I had Melissa baby and Jessie baby and Paul baby I was a little scared when I went to have that little baby
it was fine
it went just fine
no right down the street
just a couple of buildings down was my hospital
too loose
or we can cut it off when we go home
you know that we were here before
you were three and Melissa was just five
she just turned five
they always do names backwards in here
can you read that
pretty clever
well I think you're pretty clever
it's the date
April oh that's your birthday
April
four means April
twelve mean twelve right
and that's your birthday
and you were born in nineteen
seventy
nineteen seventeen
no way
nineteen seventy five
if you were born in nineteen seventeen you know how old you'd be this year

more stairs with a little turn

oh you drank that quickly
you drank that quickly
there's a Star_Wars poster
is that R_two_D_two
no kidding
from space
no kidding
that's a riot
that's a riot
you know what
I asked Doctor Strom if he needed if you could go swimming Saturday
and he said yeah
and you know what else I asked him
if uh you needed to wear a bathing cap
he said all we have_to get is a tennis band
it's like a head band
put that over your ears
put the ear plugs in right
and put the tennis just put the tennis band right around there
a sweat band
and that will hold them
and you don't have_to wear a bathing cap if you don't want to
doesn't that sound good
so all we have_to do is go to a store and find a tennis band
Maria has a head band yeah
I'll have_to write that on your medicine list
daddy's going to say what medicine xxx
do you remember going to sleep
no he says he didn't go to sleep
you didn't go
you didn't giggle
no
okay
and you wanted your breakfast
do you remember that
you woke up and you said
where's my breakfast
and we said
you can't have breakfast this morning
because you have_to have your tubes and your adenoids fixed first
you know what
we're right in the front of the hospital
and if I look out remember where I drove in and I took the I went the wrong way and I had to back up
remember that
that's where we are
where they're doing that building
where all of those places are that said no parking
pretty soon we'll walk right out the front door
they're all waiting I guess
we were lucky we were first right
it's a bed
and it has sides because sometimes the medicine makes you kind of jumpy and wiggly
and these beds are so little
it's not a crib though
it's just called a hospital bed
you feel pretty good
you still feel thirsty
what sweetheart
why don't you lie down
want a straw
oh my_goodness those are that is a blood pressure machine
and this is called an i_v
you don't need any of those things
that might be for oxygen
these are all the things that people might need
but you're doing so well you don't need anything at all
just terrific right
does that cool you off a bit
yeah
it might make him feel better
you're awfully brave you know
you didn't cry when you went off
said a little bit
like a few minutes
boy there was someone climbing around right outside this window here
you can get dressed and go home
but before you do that I'm going to listen to your heart
this young man has the same thing
he's not quite awake though
not as awake as you are
sounds pretty good
good
perfect
perfect
you can get dressed
you have_to hold mommy's hand because you still may be a little bit sleepy
but mommy can get you dressed
and we'll have someone check you and then you can go
you did well
I think the only way to get that off is to snip it off
here's your blue card back Paul
he did very well
yes that's more than enough
mommy
go outside now
xxx go outside with it
what
I'm gonna go outside with it
whoops it's going a little all over
go outside
maybe we'll all go sit by the picnic table
why don't you do that okay
oh that sounds good
can I make you one Debbie
will you join me
no thanks I just ate lunch
you're gonna make me feel bad here eating all by myself
oh no please enjoy it
that's right
will she be home soon
well she should be home about three fifteen or so
I forgot
the teacher keeps her one afternoon and works with her on her reading and I forgot about it
well that's fine
she's the one that actually did it the best so you might consider if it would work out with what you're studying the older kids worked out a little better
right yeah
I'm sure
they were willing to ignore it
mommy
button this
it certainly doesn't go with the salad I had for lunch
for me I'll take ice cream most of the time
will you show me the way back there
ahhah
it's small
it's nice though for someone who
I haven't had a yard in some years
oh you haven't
so this even looks good
oh yeah
put up the swing
mommy put up the swing
so how has your job hunt been coming
oh well I've actually
I think I'm pretty much worked out
oh good
I'll
I'm doing research during June and then I'll work in an office
mommy where's my tape recorder
where's my tape recorder
pardon me
what were you saying
June I have a research job up here and July August I'll go down home work in an office
now where was home
it was near New_York wasn't it
that's right
in Westchester
what do you think Zachy
what did he say
xxx would eat it
what does it taste like Zachy
mommy know what
I said it tastes like vanilla
mommy know what
when I eat this it tastes like big big crumbs
bread crumbs
just about bread crumbs
bread crumbs
they're cookie crumbs
I think they got this idea from an ice cream shop in Boston called Steve's
have you ever heard of it
my sisters live in Boston and they always talk about it and there's one car over by Centralschool that has Steve's ice cream shop in Boston bumper sticker
this looks like an ice cream Sundae
oh
and that's what they had is cookie sandwiches or something
they have like eight bins of different things
they have broken up candies and oreos and peanuts and then you can order anything to be mixed right into the ice cream
I love chocolate Sundaes
I see
I see that at Centerithaca there's a big xxx
yeah
I really
I guess going away to Boston I found out that I like purity just as_well_as anything else at all
my sister always was talking about going to Steve's place
there's a huge line
that's what she says
in fact this ice cream is sold some place in Massachusetts
because I go frontwards
oh yeah
I thought they were just in Ithaca
can I go backwards
yeah
well they are but somebody who sells fudge has switched and now they sell fudge and purity
at least they were a couple of years ago
they were selling this fresh fudge and then purity I thought was serving their ice cream up there
maybe not
see this is what happens whenever I put the thing out in the room
right
it sounds kind of garbled xxx
we have a bigger speaker to tie in the recordings xxx
yeah the four of the kids are all xxx
yeah that's what usually happens
so it's up to you to figure out who's saying what
I don't know if it matters for what you want
