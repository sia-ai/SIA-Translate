we went to a wake last night
and after the wake we went over to the Prudential
my two cousins and I we decided you know to go over the Prudential for a cup of coffee
well we went in Shirley had a dollar Eleanor had two and I had three
the bill was five twenty
what did you do
then I had some change
we had no intentions of going anywhere after the wake
we come out we walked you know all around and I figured it's so beautiful up there the fountain
I keep meaning to go up there
oh it's swell
we come out
I had taken the Mass Turnpike in
as you come up from the Mass Turnpike it said no parking
so you know we parked and said
let's get out of here
so we were in about two hours
we come out and we couldn't find the car
did you figure it was stolen
we couldn't find the parking lot
we come out the wrong door
we come out
the back and the front look exactly alike
uhhuh
you know they've got the big escalators to go up and everything
we couldn't find the parking lot
we're standing there killing ourselves laughing
for an hour we kept walking up and down up and down
my poor cousin Shirley was so sick
she had an awful cold
we dragged her all over the place
her feet were killing her
finally we come against a guard up front you know
he said
I wondered what you three were laughing about
we lost the car you know
finally he said
I don't know where you could've put it
there isn't any there's a little parking lot way down behind there you go down then you go up and down
he said
the cars always get towed away and it'll cost you eight dollars
we didn't even have ten cents to make a phone call
we were hysterical
finally we found the car
it was still there
it was the same parking lot
yeah
the towing away one
yeah they didn't tow ours anyway
Sarah when are you gonna learn how to drive
yeah
down at the Stop_and_Shop parking lot he had her sitting in his lap and she was steering the car
are you good good at steering
mhm
everytime I think about last I start laughing
what
every time I think of last night can kill myself laughing
three idiots walking up and down the sidewalk
oh
you feel so silly and helpless
we didn't know whether to go right or to go left
nothing looked familiar
we didn't know where to go
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime
I had a dime and I gave it to Eleanor
she put the dime in the thing that you turn
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went down you know
just then the matron come in
and Eleanor said
well I put the dime in and the you know I just can't get in
the matron said
you you didn't put a dime in
oh
oh it was awful
we had a heck of a time
anyway that girl was upset
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said
well here's the dime
xxx Eleanor
by this time Eleanor was tearing you know
and Eleanor said
I don't want the dime
but I put the dime in
she said
well she was right
that's terrible
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to people who put things in just as a matter of principle
yeah Eleanor says
I don't care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one we had
and she said we didn't put it in you know
next time I go to a wake with them I'm gonna make sure I take money with me
Shirley was
