Frederick
dandelion
on a sunny Saturday morning dandelion
that's his daddy
you're right
Dandelion woke up stretched and yawned and jumped out of bed
after doing his daily exercises
Dandelion looked out of the window
blinked his eyes and said I wonder if the mail has come
he put on his sweater and went outside to the mail box
there was a letter and it was written in fancy gold ink
dear Dandelion you are invited to my tea and taffy party on Saturday afternoon at half passed three
come as you are
sincerely Jennifer Giraffe
Dandelion was very excited
it's a good thing I'm getting a hair cut today he said
as soon as he washed and dried the dishes
and made his bed nice and neat
he ran down the street to the barber shop
Lou Kangaroo had a chair waiting for him
first he trimmed Dandelion's hair
and then gave him a shampoo
Dandelion thought he should have a manicure to
right he's cleaning his nails
when Lou Kangaroo had finished Dandelion looked a bit foolish
his mane was frizzy and fuzzy and completely unrulish
xxx silly
maybe a wave would help Lou suggested showing him a picture in the latest fashion magazine for lions
Dandelion agreed
this was exactly what he needed
so Lou went about curling his mane
he looked
magnificent
but now
magnificent
but now Dandelion thought he'd
magnificent
magnificent
very good honey
but now Dandelion thought he really should wear something more elegant than a sweater to the party
this jacket is the very newest style said Theodore the tailor
and it just fits you
all you need now is a cap and a cane
Happy Crane will be happy to help you
what a damper dandy he had suddenly become
that's Happy Crane
it's nearly half past three said Dandelion
I've just time to get something for my hostess
a bouquet of dandelions would be perfect
he knew this tall door very well
having been here many times before
he rang the bell
when Jennifer Giraffe opened the door she looked very surprised
yes she said
what can I do for you
but I'm here for your party he said
why I'm sorry sir you are not anyone I know she said
you must have the wrong address
and with that she closed the door right in poor Dandelion's face
I'm Dandelion he roared you've made a mining mistake
but the door stayed tight shut
Dandelion walked back and forth down the block
and as he paced
he is sad
the sky grew dark
and a sudden gust of wind sprang up and blew away his beautiful bouquet
and his snappy cap flew off
they blew away in the wind
oh no
to make matters worse it began to rain in
Torrance
Dandelion dropped his cane
and stood under a weeping willow tree
but the rain pored down through the branches
Dandelion was soon soak and wet and his curls came unfurled
he took off his jacket
and hung it on a willow branch
luckily he had kept on his sweater
at last the rain stopped
and the warm sunshine came down
Dandelion sat on Jennifer Giraffe's front steps until his mane was dry
huh while he sat there waiting he spotted three dandelion flowers
more dandelions
they had been protected
they didn't blow away
they had protected from the wind and rain
he picked the dandelions and said I think I will try again
and rang the bell
well if it isn't our friend Dandelion
we've been waiting for over an hour for you
I do hope you weren't caught in that awful cloud burst
everyone at the party greeted him hardly
and Jennifer Giraffe told Dandelion about the silly looking lion that had come to the door
Dandelion almost spilt his cup of tea
that was me I was the silly looking one
what's he drinking
is it delicious
oh yummy
Miss Giraffe was so flustered she got herself tangled in her
pearl necklace
I promise I will never do such a thing again she said
and I promise you I will never again try to turn myself into a stylish dandy said Dandelion
from now on I'll always be just
plain me
do you want Frederick
