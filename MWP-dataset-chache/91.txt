that was good
that was about three
that's strange Sue
now
oh don't
oh oh
alright
the loudspeaker is gonna be attached to his chair
and so
when he needs to be different places he's gonna tell us through this part of it and we're gonna answer him through this part of it
it's easy just to give him a xxx like that right
see he can he can really pull hard because it's it's a stretchy one because you see how this knot this is sort of knotted
and see this thing comes out and he can just give us through that
that's how he does it
okay
so it could be as long as we want
watch

this goes to us
this time goes to us
see who's gonna tell us when to turn the lights out
honey
Sue
he's gonna tell us when to turn the lights off

four dollars would realy be enough
maybe five he might earn
hey
how many days

how many days do you want Andrew to take care of your babies for over night
oh
it can't be that long
it can't
because then the babies would be dead
for five weeks
you want Andrew to take care of your babies
five how about five months
because five months is longer
oh
I know better
I know better
I know better than that
how about
wait
I've got an idea
how about four weeks
four months
I mean four months
four months will be just right
because Andrew starts his first day of school
