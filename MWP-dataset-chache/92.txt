getting you right in the back+seat
just give me the babies
just give me their their blankets and stuff
I've gotta get different blankets
it's not the white blanket
you can have this blanket but this isn't the white blanket I meant okay
there's a white blanket in here somewhere
hey
I've got a great thing to be one of your baby's blankets
this sort of nightie kind of
here
could could I put in on her
no
pretend it was her pyjamas
that would be nice
yeah
yeah
you need to put them in their pyjamas
he's in his pyjamas
he's in his summer pyjamas
but she's cold blooded and so she needs
right
clear up your other babies in the lights of the xxx
your babies have xxx don't they
yeah
this this one xxx
yeah
well
you know what
this thing that I clean all your babies sort of like a blanket
because I used to use it with Shauna
and I would never take a blanket along because you know what it would do
it would just slip off and on like that
it and it's always so long on her you know
because Shauna was like your baby
she was wobbly and stuff
see
Shauna's my child
oh yes
see how xxx
see how it sorta goes off her arm and goes down like that
see what I mean it's sort sort of like a blanket
so you xxx
I'm having xxx
hey
she has the same kind of nightie
I don't think you need any blanket
but if you do would need one I think it's good to take one blanket
at least for your kids
yeah
do you think so
no don't
because it's very cold
go to the can't you see out there
we have to drive to the airport but right now it's xxx hot
but when we drive to the airport it's gonna be cold it's gonna be a little bit cooler
it's probably gonna be rainy
it's gonna be raining very hard
that's gonna be very that's gonna be very cold for ehrm
you know it's gonna be very cold
see if she's got the same hide
I'm just letting out
these cars are going here
well
this one's very cute for Jonathon
I thought it was very nice
or do you want another special thing like that
hey
I've got a better idea for your baby
instead of that shirt I've got a better shirt for your kids
how about if you use this sweater instead of that shirt
yeah
but not this because this is too warm
no
it's too
no
it's not too warm
it's too cool
it's too cold
and so you're gonna have to change both of your babies in to something warmer
yes
that's her diapers
so
xxx are you going crazy or something
oh man
this won't even fit through it
you know what we're gonna have to do with your baby
see the sweater
her arms are so tiny
and the sweater arms are so big
that's what I used to do with Shaunathon
I had to
and her head would always turn around
she always liked xxx
and that's xxx problem with you xxx
probably
I'm not sure
don't put on your tape on diapers
new pocket
yeah
did never did what
those what
yeah
we never did
here Sue
how do you like that
that looks really warm
and you know what
if you need to cover her legs up see what there is
just put her legs through there
Sean
Sean
I used to have this because we used to go to the North_pole every summer every summer
and it would be winter in the North_Pole because it keeps light the the snows
Sean liked the snow
and when Anne was just a tiny little baby and I used to use this on on ehrm Sean
just to keep I mean ehrm
yeah
on Sean because Andrew was just getting born
you know he got born at the North_Pole
Andrew got born at the North_Pole
that's why he's so
right
your house didn't break down
but me and you are still good friends you see
that's what it does
I keep the lens warm too
but I think you need the leg leggings on
because we really used to go to the North_Pole and you really need something warm
this isn't a sweater
this is a suit
arms are xxx
yeah
it's a pajama+suit
and you can us it as a nightie or a pajama+suit
because it goes like that
let me see if you need that if you need if it's too short
see
look what you can do
see it even keeps her neck warm and that's really good
isn't that a nice thing
see
so that's really good
I like that
I like that Swww xxx
yeah
because they're right in here
right
mm
so she's really warm
you see what would happen see
it's all it's all
squeeze the back of her neck
it's really
geesh
I know about cuts
it's dried up blood
see
and what you can also do is sort of make a sash if you if you're not using the pants part
how about that
you're not using the pants part so why don't you make a xxx
yes we can
yes we do
yeah
pretend you do
you know why
because then it won't get in your way and and you know what could happen
we could lose that suit because someone could step on these things
and then they could be stepping on it stepping on it stepping on it on the plane and you will lose your baby
because it would stretch
and it and that won't stretch
that will only stretch the knot
and you'd be home at sea
so if the knot gets tighter and tighter you're baby will start crying right
and so then the lady who was walking at her or man who was walking on it would look back and say well that's attached to a baby I'd better save I I don't know what that's attached to you see
if it wasn't if it if see if it it was if it wasn't in a knot
if it wasn't in a knot it would stretch see
and the xxx
they look when your baby starts crying because because the it it shoes get poured away
you know you would have to run through a big crowd
and you might and you might miss the plane
so think when you were supposed to get off and then go somewhere else you know that
it would be very hard
you see
so it's better to be in a knot
then you see so then it would only stretch to there
oo oo oof
maybe he won't even cry see
so that's much better
see this one
she won't even cry
see what I mean
see what I mean
here
this baby's awake
she's having a great time
can I say hello to her
I think this one is Melinda right
this one's Melinda
hello Melinda
she needs her xxx snapped
here
here's another thing I used to use use on Sean
and everything will be xxx it see
this is everything I used to use on Sean
see what I mean
she won't be cold
no way
this hole this hole
oh
of course she would have
this
it looks so it looks so cool
and it feels so cool if you're if you're not in it
but if you are in it

you can rub his face with this hand
you know
he really feels sad
he feels jealous
because you know
some of his brothers and sister's really mean
see what they need
and you know they all have to be nursed and Andrew sometimes is cranky and he's and he's and Andrew's mostly awake and playing around with the other babies
and he sees the other babies and he sees me taking care of the other babies and playing with them
and he's just sitting in that car+bed watching
he doesn't know what to do
and he kept he he just took his bath and Mama doesn't hear him cry
