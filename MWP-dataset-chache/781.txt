uhhuh
it's pretty Abe
that's nice too Abe
those are very poisonous
those are coral snakes
they bite
and the poison goes through your system
then you have_to use your snakebite kit
what
sure
it did
okay here you go Abe
here
oh let's make some straps
it sure will here you go like so
oh because that's how it works
nope I'm going to cut your bangs first
and then we can ride our bikes to Tom_Thumb together
and you can use your little flag okay
let me cut your bangs first
if you use your flag then you'll be safe from cars right
right
they'll know that that flag's a warning
what else will they say
yeah and maybe they would say
I wonder if that flag is brand new
what would you say
when did you get it
uhhuh today
what part of it
my bangs
Ninny she used to take care of my hair
no she didn't know about them
out_of hair
I don't see how that would work really
I met a lady today who had read The_Hobbit
she knew all about Bilbo and Frodo
it's a story about little short people
I'll have_to read it to you sometime
okay we're done
I'll get some powder to put on your legs
so the hair won't make them itch
I use it
because you don't ask me to
that's a good idea
that way you won't get a rash
what is
what do you call that
you're scrubbing my leg with your foot
good deal
would you scrub the floor for me if I got you some soap and water
I was teasing
yep we need some milk
we're not going to buy any toys okay
wrong
Abe here's two pennies
you can put these in your piggybank until you get a whole bunch of pennies
and then you can go to Tom_Thumb
right so go ahead and put these in your penny bank
I'll come help you
you're getting a_lot
alright is it cold out now
do you think we ought_to put on pants
do you need your shoes on Abe
uhhuh in the back
okay
I sure did Abe
it was under the table
I think I'll just walk beside you while you ride your bike okay
you want me to ride my bike
okay I will
on your flag
huh
what
the yeast
it might be the molasses
yeah I just made half of a batch
any what
how are we going to dig them off
dig them up or dig them up
Abe I have_to brush your hair and brush your teeth
yeah you can't forget your suitcase
uhhuh did you listen to the weather Stan
no
it is
how
gee that sounds a_lot like a sponge bath
in just a few minutes
what
your Robin_Hood book
Ninny will be glad to see that
you can show her how you colored all the pictures
yeah
you remembered his name
who did what
I don't know
who did
yeah
because he was trying to help his friend Robin_Hood
it's not time to go yet
okay
okay that's a good idea
there's some milk on the table
isn't that enough
what
you want more
okay here you go
did you tell Daddy about your new trick
the one on the table
what trick
where he jumps from the hassock to the table
oh yeah he's already shown me that
what
I'm going to ding you in the dong buddy
I don't remember that part
I don't know
I showed it to you outside
I don't know if you brought it in or not
what's this
where did you put your gun
what do you want
toast with what
okay what did you do outside
you did
then what happened
he was in his storage box
what else did you do
uhhuh
yeah
what did you play
it will
it's a what
yeah let's put that in the pin cushion
uhhuh hey that doesn't go in your milk
it's something to hang pictures on a wall
what else did you do when you were outside
I saw you riding something
it was
oh
do you want your toast cut in half
yeah that's pretty neat
when did you discover that
really
I was taking the trash out
and I saw you riding it up a big hill
did you see me
you saw my what
my head
where are you going
have a good time
what would you like for lunch
I don't think we will
you have_to eat lunch now
why don't we go to Minnesota_Fabrics instead
it's right over there
that's called a pencil sharpener
Abe what would you like for lunch
okay
Abe what do you want for lunch
I'm sorry
I didn't hear you
oh I thought you were through sharpening it
yeah let me show you how to do it
you hold it still
and you turn the pencil see
what are you making Abe
wow that will really be pretty
was it a big rainbow Abe
right Abe
okay tell me
you don't want a grilled peanut butter
you do
you had an egg
did you like it
do you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
wow are you sure that's what you want
did you tell Daddy what your curtains are going to look like
a jungle with giraffes
no camels live in the desert
giraffes eat the leaves off of trees
there aren't very many trees in the desert are there
I wonder what camels eat
that would be hard on their intestines I'm afraid
do you want walleye tonight
you like it Abe
you're silly
did anyone ever call you Willy
what's it look like Abe
that's right
Daddy found it
maybe we can fly it tomorrow
Abe that isn't our tent
everything you see outside isn't yours
somebody left it and will probably want it later on
because it just came out_of the pan
it is
go ahead and eat it
and then I'll fix you a jelly sandwich
do you think we should give this away
this pottiechair
yeah
Abe never used it
now it is
but you wouldn't ever use it when you were younger
don't you think we should give it away
yeah we don't need it
that's really good reasoning Abe
I guess we'll keep it
in one of the closets
oh
uhhuh
that was an extra stick
there were three sticks and you only use two sticks to make a kite
how sad
why is it dying
oh
yeah I'll show it to you
okay
I don't think we'll go until tomorrow Abe
I can make it
so there's four
you do want four
I'm trying to put some of these clothespins together
so we can have some useable ones
yeah
how come
your horse is stuck
thanks Abe
there's more there
I'm getting them
you just get the same sizes and put them together
I put them in the bag
did it fall on the floor
oh this kind
uhhuh
go ahead and try
I'm going to go out and hang up the clothes
see if you can
why don't you eat first
huh
I don't know
I don't think so
I think it's in the house
no
maybe
let's look in here some more
okay I'll get you some in just a second
we don't have_to wait for Mom
we'll go look before that
because they're so dirty
dirty from what
you think the gas from our car made my feet dirty
what part
oh the gas pedal
I'm not sure
what
it sounds like what
how come
oh
Abe just a second
why don't you throw that in the trash

so it'll stay together
we'll have_to fix that won't we
you did too

do you think he's out
aw

since we didn't find it in the car
I don't either
I don't see your gun

I'm glad
really
I was looking for the bee
what's the name of that book
which one
nope I haven't seen it
if you want me to
the mommy bee lays her eggs

that's so you can watch what they're talking about
what
yeah it's in there
yeah I sure did
go ahead
what did she have
that's a pizza knife
so it can cut pizza easier
I know
we don't have a pizza knife
what did you do outside
why not
tell me what you've been doing
yeah you told me what you were doing then
but then you went outside again
and then you came back inside to eat some toast
so tell me what you did when you went outside again

that's something I found
do you like that
see if you can open it
yeah here I'll show you
see you open it like this
and you close it like this
you try it
you can put stuff in it
you don't need to tie them
you close it with the string
see
it's closed
how could you
because it makes it tight
it was up on that shelf
uhhuh what would you like to eat

I thought I already told you
I'll wipe you off in just a second
do you want it
here you go
do what
be patient Abe
we don't have any hot water
they sleep during the day
and then when it gets cool at night they come out
it's too hot during the day
they don't
they hide
they go where it's cool like by the swamp
that way it's not too hot for them
you really have_to be fast and accurate to get mosquitoes that way
have you ever got any mosquitoes like that
you're going to try
how did that happen
do you think it happened when you fell off your bike
open your eyes

we need to saw this off
what are you gonna do
why don't we nail it
it'll work better if we nail it
let me see where did you get this idea
oh the nail's too big
so you know what we should do
tape it
what
who's going to sit on it
good
you can Abe
not really
you're the engineer Abe right
he's the guy who tells the construction guy how to do it
or would you rather build it
you might need to
because what if I do it wrong
then you'll yell at me
I'll get to that piece
where does this go
right here
did you like that show we went to see
which parts were spooky
those were spooky parts huh
I don't like spooky parts
what
did I like them then
nope I like to watch the calvary
those were army guys back when there were cowboys
how's it going
good
what else
oh
I thought you already had an ax Abe
I thought Daddy made you one
oh
when did it get lost
when we lived here
have we lived here long Abe
how long have we lived here
have we lived here for a year
for a month
well we like our new place better don't we
uhhuh I like to
do you like to
like what
how on earth do you make a strinablob
does it talk
what kind of sounds do snakes make
they hiss
because the seesaw won't stand up right
uhhuh
it's in your box
no it's in your box here
that's neat
how about your little people
Raggedy_Andy
he sure would be lucky to have you for a brother
because you're so nice and thoughtful
you'd need to practice first
they're in your closet
that is a good idea
no he hasn't done it yet
what do you want me to do
let me see
they have pretty big bottoms don't they
what is that
what was it that it was in
a pocket it was in my pocket
hand me the scotch tape Abe
so I can fix this
it depends
maybe
I think seven would be an ideal age
because you could be in the Cub_Scouts
I was
when I was seven
my Mommy did
your Grandma is my Mommy
tell me who's my Mom
that's right
I'll try
here put the tape up
what's crowded
they're kids who go exploring and camping
Abe would you get me the tape again
okay
Abe this is not what you would call a good seesaw
what do you mean fix it again
what's wrong with it
when did we get those seesaws Abe
I mean sea shells
when did we get them
you're being silly
how come
why don't you work outside for awhile
huh
yeah
what
the littlest what
oh this is the hole puncher
do you want holes in here
what
oh that's all I'll put in then
is that good
what
oh so you think I should make it work
here how's that
you what
let me see
come here for a second
do you want a string on it
you do
that's a pretty good telescope isn't it
oh
where
okay
okay
one of her what
she has baby ducks
her ducks have wheels
they're just toy ducks huh
you did
it's not silly for a duck to say quack
how much older do you think you should be before you get a pocketknife
nope
I think Jason's five
we'll see
I don't know
we'll have_to wait and see
how does that work
huh
you do
you are
I know
it's the wrong time of year to look for Easter eggs
maybe you could look for something else
let's think
what could you look for
I doubt if there's any milk outside
oh yeah but I mean right out here
you'd have_to look pretty hard to find a cow over there too
what
a pretty rock
a ice cream
camping stuff
