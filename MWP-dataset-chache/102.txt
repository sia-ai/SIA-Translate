this is still part of the same tape on June
Laura's gonna help me with one other thing that is really fun to do
pouring water
okay Laura
yeah
well let's do it with this first
alright
see this measuring cup
see
it has a cup of water in it
alright
uh huh
would you
yes
would you pour the water into this white cup over here please for me
what
yes I am
okay
you pour it into that cup
okay
now I wanna ask you an important question
do you have the same amount of water in the purple cup as you have in this white
big measuring cup
how do you know
it the same water
would you pour the water back into the measuring cup for me
try not to spill it
okay
would you please pour the water in the yellow cup please
thank you
now can you tell me do you have the same amount of water as was in the measuring cup
in the yellow cup
how do I know
okay
but look Laura
this this is taller
but it's taller and that one's lower
alright
show me again
how do I know it's the same water
right
you poured it from one cup to the other
and then
right
so that this
okay
Laura has repeated the whole task
pouring task
would you pour it this water in the tall glasses that all the other glasses please
oh
and then xxx
that's a good idea
okay
go ahead
okay
now why don't you stop pouring right there
we need some in your measuring+cup
oh you're gonna make it even in each cup
do you have the same amount in each cup do you think
okay
well how will you know when you have the same amount in the measuring+cup
almost
okay you've taken a little water from each cup
now
how are you deciding Laura that there's the same amount in each cup
are you looking on the side of the cup
but but this cup is taller
don't you
and skinnier than this cup
don't you have to put more water in that cup
to make it xxx
Laura's xxx measuring the water now
she's not putting this
she's not compensating
we're just making it the same level as each cup
even this taller one
it's skinnier than
look
look how much bigger and wider the purple cup is
how come it doesn't matter
I think it matters
don't you have to
okay
so Laura just measured the water level
they all have the same amount of water
are you sure
you sure this
this tall glass has as much as this big wide glass
how come
Laura's pouring from the wide glass into the smaller glass and making the water levels be absolutely the same
okay
very interesting Laura
now if this glass was filled with chocolate with milk Laura
I'm gonna fill two glasses
if this glass if these glasses were filled not with water but chocolate milk the ones that you made equal which glass would you choose to have your chocolate milk out of
which one do you want
now Laura's doing Eeny_Meeny_Miny_Mo
because
oh
so you're gonna do Eeny_Meeny_Miny_Mo on all of them huh
so you're gonna keep this tall
I'm gonna show you something Laura
let's pour this water out
in this cup
and I want you to measure how much water
was in your tall glass
okay let's measure
in the measuring+cup
what line does it come up to
okay
the bottom line
okay now let's
okay
now let's measure the water that was in the purple cup
you pour it
don't spill it because we want to measure it carefully
how far does that come up too
a little over
so which cup had more
the purple cup or the y yellow cup
purple cup
why do you think that is if you made the two cups equal
by the same amount
you didn't
that's right
you have to put a little more in the yellow cup
yeah
getting a little closer
so which cup needs
in
why do you think you have to keep pouring more into the yellow cup
well how is the yellow cup different from the purple cup
that's right
it's taller
and how is the purple cup different from the yellow cup
yeah
now you've got it right
how's the
how's the yellow cup different from the purple cup
I
I mean how's the purple cup different from the yellow
it's wider and shorter
and what's this one
