he was denying that they were the wrong size
he was saying
Ross you were saying Ross's are too big
mhm right
he has them on
he has them on and he says
uhuh uhuh they're not too big
so anyway he has basically denied my assumptions and also not following my reasoning
since he has denied my assumptions I think he didn't care to follow the rest of the reasoning
well yeah you're denying his assumption too
right
his assumption is that if he can walk around in them
then they're big big enough for him yeah
they're fine
yeah
and your assumption is the right size
is smaller
is smaller and
those are too big
because Ross's size is bigger therefore
