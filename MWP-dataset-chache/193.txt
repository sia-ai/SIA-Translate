doggie
what does that doggie say
forget it huh
what's that
balloon
balloon
balloon
oh
smell that
nothing huh
she's sometimes really does talk
I'm trying to think um lots_of people's names people that we see um
more animals and animal sounds uh
she says ball and she says ball for balloon and um she says doggie kitty duckie
uh she doesn't say cow but she says moo and you know the the appropriate sounds
for some of those cat and a dog and a chick
come here Alice
and cheese
and hot
well I think she had hot before
um juice
she uses cheese when she opens the refrigerator door and sees it
she says cheese cheese
and uh and juice
she says
and baba
those important things
only the blocks and the doll and the stuffed dog
well books
she has a_lot_of books
and she can say book too
she can't say telephone
but um she says hi
she doesn't zip and unzip
we don't practice that
I mean Is that Dapper Dan
we don't have that and she's not encouraged to tie and untie
yes it's for sassy
we call it a sassy I don't even know why we do
let me put your shoes on
uh I guess she could
I just we just don't
I don't have any I don't have that toy
I have something with a zipper but I just don't play with it with her
right
well I double knot them but I I don't know
I just we don't play with her shoes
oh pretty aware um we have some animal books
mostly dogs and cats but getting to chicks and ducks and pigs and goats and we had a thing we did with the camel and she recognizes the camel know
I have no idea what a camel says but we decided that a camel says It just sticks its tongue out
and whenever I say there's a camel she starts to smile cause she thinks it's ridiculous when I make that sound
so um we have those animals and uh yeah and a turtle and a fish we have in books
yeah and we call squirrels kitty but just because she sees them out the window and thinks they're kitties not I think squirrel's pretty hard to say
yeah um yeah uh we have of course Lauren has a multitude of brushes around the house and combs
she likes to comb her own hair and she will comb some animals that we have too I mean the real animals and and the toys like this here
well we have a hamster
actually I'm after a puppy right now
yeah but more entranced with this than with anything else she played with
probably less
she was in a stage then and we got her a phone and she played with it then for a couple of months and now not too much at all
but she did like the push+button phone
okay Alice
we don't have a push+button phone at home
at home I
mostly I just point and say what's that
uh I guess I'm thinking about it now
I don't really say can you say
I don't really say that I guess as often as I said it here
uh I was really aware that she wasn't saying anything
uh but that's why
she really did say more than she did last time
I can't tell you how much more verbal she is at home
she's doing things like this
she's exploring the whole house
it's she's never confined
it's impossible
um I don't usually ask her what she wants she usually shows me
but that was a situation of her being up here and it being on the floor
but if I say What do you want she'll go get it
but um
um she might if it was a doggie
because I really thought she wanted the doggie
yeah doggie she could say
and I think that was what I was trying to get her to to say
but I thought maybe she would say it if she couldn't reach it
but she's much she's really ph more physical than verbal
all this throwing and everything
yeah she really is
I mean she would much more I mean she would much rather throw these than look at the things on them
you know what now I mean or uh books she'll look at but uh a_lot_of real physical running around falling down
uh she has a similar one with things to touch and look at yeah
she did
she put her finger through the hole yeah
she likes peekaboo
that's why I like this page a lot
and she can say peekaboo
peekaboo
