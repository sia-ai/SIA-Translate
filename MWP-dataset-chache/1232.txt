yeah
maybe Daddy can help you
may I help you Boo
okay can Daddy sit with you while you do it
yeah you need something to stabilize it
steak
you mean steak like what the bear eats in that book that kind of steak
hm
yeah well this is one of 'em
xxx that I had in mind
what
I said this house is like exactly like what I had in mind
well there are a number that are huge like that I mean
for rent I don't know
yeah no I've seen xxx sleeps
you can get sleeps eight sleeps ten
pretty easily but it doesn't mean they're
it's actually it's actually sumptuous accommodations
you're looking through Great Houses For A Family Vacation that's you your children and your friends each have their own xxx
I thought Daddy said he was gonna sit with you
well I was refused
oh that's right
can I sit with you Boo and help
what do you want me to do
can I help
if I hold it
okay
can I make a suggestion
you don't wanna hear my idea
alright then I won't tell you my idea
you know you know why
you don't need to hear what you think
what what I think about it
because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego
see how this is wider
if you put the wider legos on the bottom it'll be more stable
see this is wider and this is skinny and narrow
if you put the narrow towers on top of the wider towers it'll be more stable
yeah even that is better
that if I were you I'd put that on the bottom
'cause that's really stable that's like a platform
it's a pretty big tower though
and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand that also helps
to keep it more stable
shall we have a civilized breakfast together
that would be nice
what do you think Naima Boo
do you wanna have breakfast together
aw
I thought you wanted kiwi
kiwi is delicious
let's put the xxx
she needs to pung it back Daddy
yes
oh you want me back here
okay
how 'bout if we stabilize it by putting it on that
it'll help
you don't think so
I'm stabilizing it
alright alright
you hold it
you know to make something more stable it will help if you
aw
see
put the wider ones on the bottom and the narrow ones on the top
there there
see it's more stable look at how stable that is now
and the other thing is it's hard to make things stable on carpet like this
'cause it's sort of uneven
things would be more stable on that floor which is much more flat
see this is an uneven floor
well I meant this kind of
this part of the floor in the kitchen is more stable
we'll put this up here
what's who gonna try and do
I'm gonna peel the kiwi now
mm
oh
it's very unstable
oh that's pretty good but when it's that tall on such a narrow base it's often loses it's balance Booboo
hey that's pretty good
hey
you wanna show Mommy
hey Mommy
oh I see that's a really tall tower
wowee look at that
yay
I think that when you put it on the kitchen floor and moved it from the carpet it helped a lot
she's making these as presents for Sleepy Bear
oh boy
he's a lucky bear
here's some kiwi
mhm
um do you want to uh
I I'm happy to make a run and get some maple syrup 'cause it they have some xxx
I wasn't going to suggest
I know but
well I don't
I mean there's toast and there's jam I don't
can you can you bring this over and give it to her and and try to wave it in front of her face or something
you have some kiwi Boo
Daddy's gonna eat some have some
it's yummy
mm
oh you're right there's hardly any syrup
do we have a syrup mouse in the house
we do
I've been using it in my cereal when I have cereal
oh oh that's what
I use it ostensibly to cut the taste of the flax oil
allegedly
well I think it's enough for us to split that last pancake that was from yesterday
oh oh we could
and then we can have toast also
I mean since we're
we only have one
two more mornings here I wouldn't really be in favor of buying a whole maple syrup just for that 'cause I don't want to have_to carry back a lot of
okay
half used food things
mhm
mm I think Naima likes kiwi Mommy
oh the chair is there
her special puffin place mat is up there
hey do you wanna sit up here and eat
sit properly
you have your puffin place mat that you like xxx
did you hear a fog horn
oh yeah okay
do you remember that noise we heard last time
I mean at xxx Head it was a grunting noise
Daddy said it was a fog horn but Mommy said she didn't think so
okay
whee this Baby_oh
oh I didn't realize we're
the tape is running
yeah
okay this is just barely warm but
Naima do you want some pancake too
does
she doesn't have a mic does she
yeah
it's right here
oh
well doesn't it taste a little bit like muffin
it's like a blueberry muffin that's what I thought
is it also like a muffin shape
hm
mm
that looks pretty yummy
you wanna split this with me
uh sure
if there's enough
I think there's enough syrup for this
xxx xxx ridiculous
hm
these are uh luxury rentals throughout the world
oh xxx
and there's one um
xxx there's one called Cirrhosis on the Sea
oh how awful
it is pathetic
hm oh here's an island
the wild beauty of Ireland freeze your ass off
what xxx
it says that
no it doesn't
why are you even looking at this silly site
well 'cause I'm trying to find Maine coast stuff that might have
you trying to find the most expensive
yeah it's uh it's like uh it's like googling right
trying to find like a really expensive thing
here have your pancake
thank you
let's all sit together
okay good
do you want some soy milk or skim milk
uh soy milk would be excellent
hey Miss Naima Boo
xxx can have breakfast
with you with you Boo
and I'll put some toast in too
I don't want toast I might have something else
cereal
Daddy doesn't want some
why
well I don't think I need cereal but I'm thinking I might like to have some cereal
'cause I like my cereal
that's a good question
it's just a habit I got
I like eating cereal in the morning
just one end
how 'bout the other end
mm
what are we gonna do today Miss Naima
are we gonna go hiking
mhm
you wanna go looking for eagles
so do I
I wanna go to
Cobb's Cook Park and look for eagles
mhm
yes I saw the fly
and we might see seagulls in the water
mhm that would be fun
I don't think there are any bears
except Naima Bear
Naima Betsy Bear
Bitsy you're right
I forgot
is it good
it's all gone I'm sorry
that was just one kiwi and you ate it
xxx and there's no more
you could have a baby yogurt
you could have
blue
blueberries
okay
mm
is that your blueberry song
mhm
um which blueberries are the
there's
well there's some in the box the organic ones
yeah xxx in this bowl
well that's the ones washed left over that aren't organic but you could give those to her I guess
they're not sprayed so
I'm gonna go xxx fiddle with the laundry
there's your yogurt
I did knock it over I'm sorry
you can fix it after breakfast
there's some stems in here Baby_oh so xxx we can get rid of the stems if you like
and that green one you don't want to eat though
that's not ripe
but you can eat the rest
mhm well all you really need to do is take the stems off
you pinch the stems off like that
and then you can eat the berries
and that way you have more berries to eat
you don't want to throw away the berries
oh you don't want to throw away good berries when you could eat them
that would be a waste of good blueberries
especially these blueberries which are delicious
we should uh
I wonder if a little boy or a little girl picked these blueberries
hm I think it was a little boy who put them out
I saw a little boy putting them out
uhoh
we bought them on the road Naima
when we went to Machaias
oh you wanna look yourself
okay
Daddy will eat some more
hm this has not been
refrigerated
what's that
this blueberry jam has not been refrigerated
should be okay
I guess but I'm gonna put it in the fridge now
um what was I thinking
oh we should um
we should try to visit the organic blueberry farm down the road
is it on
it is on the way to Cobb's Cook isn't it
uh no
or is it
no
it's on the way to Machaias
oh that's right
because otherwise we should call Gramps'
and give them a little heads+up
if we're gonna do that
maybe we should
I think we should call Gramps'
it's a working day Tuesday
yeah
so
the only issues are whether Grandma's going on a cross+country trip again
I wonder if he's
well and I wonder if they're at the Blue Hill Fair
oh
marketing or anything
I suppose so
we can give 'em a call
which starts tonight actually as far as I can tell
well
so
well if the weather's as good maybe we should take the trip
the problem
Sunday
to
Blue Hill Fair from
oh y'know it would make a lot more sense to get the blueberries except we'll have_to buy
keep buying ice
from xxx
and pick it up there
no I really would prefer Tuesday
but
'cause Gramps' Farm is out of the way
but we're not
I know
compared to Blue Hill
I mean
well they're both
I mean
Gramps' Farm is less out of the way than the Blue Hill Fair is
uh yeah but I think that trip to the Blue Hill Fair would be uh
right
good for other reasons
right but I'm just saying in terms of the tradeoff of several days of icing
and icebox versus taking the side trip to Gramps' Farm on the way home I'd prefer to take the side trip to Gramps' Farm
oh it's not the
yeah well it does
it's still a problem in terms of the timing of the trip
why
'cause we're gonna be under a lot of pressure to get
I know but
yeah
from Skudick
is that a reasonable stop
that's a very reasonable stop in fact it's almost an ideal stop it's about an hour and a half
okay well
actually maybe not xxx
maybe an hour but still
is that a good breakfast Naima
yeah
how is that jam
I haven't had any
it's good
very blueberry_y
not overly sweet
xxx we could read that after breakfast
well I'm not gonna read it 'cause I'm eating my breakfast
and I'm gonna eat some cereal now so I
I'm not gonna read it
we'll read it to you as soon
really soon as soon as we finish breakfast
you wanna talk about what's in that book
yeah
xxx Sal and her mother take some pails and go to Blueberry Hill don't they
why do they want to
why does the mother
her mother want to pick blueberries
that's right
her mother wants to can blueberries for next winter
that means
I know it probably sounds like it means put them in cans but it means put them in jars
like to make jam
yeah
on the stove and put it in jars and then store it keep it so that they will have blueberries all year round
we do that too except we put the blueberries in the freezer
so we have them all year round
almost all year round
so Naima gets to eat frozen blueberries
all year round
this is the time of year when people who have blueberry fields pick their blueberries
in fact that's probably a reason why they aren't at the Blue Hill Fair because 'cause it's probably peak time for picking
yeah
or maybe
oh little Sal finds mother crow and her children
little bear finds a mother partridge I think you're right
there are a lot of mothers and children in that book don't you think
mother
Sal's mother and Sal
the mother bear and little bear
and the mother partridge and the mother crow
and their children
I think that's all
who else
Little Bear are you eating your blueberries
gesundheit
gesundheit gesundheit
for two sneezes
oop
you need your spoon
I'll wash it
xxx kiwi seeds
xxx xxx xxx
um y'know I could take her cottage garden this morning if you wanna have a little reading morning for yourself and then we could do
yeah that's
we could do Cobb's Cook in the afternoon
I just wanna take a shower before I go out but
you wanna go on a hike this morning Naima
you wanna go on a hike with Mommy
and look at flowers and things like that
doesn't that sound like fun
hm
sour yogurt
are you gonna eat some
all that
mhm
oop
I think you dropped some blueberries out of the spoon
can you pick up the ones that're on the mat now and put them
Naima you know what you're doing now
you're making a mess
I'd like you to pick up the blueberries which are perfectly good to eat over here and either eat them or put them in your yogurt
and that goes for these over here too
these ones
pick them up and put them in the yogurt or eat them okay
good
there's some more though
over here
this is just some diapers that are on a rinse cycle I think when they're done when they start spinning I'm gonna jump in the shower
mhm
take a shower
thank you for cleaning up those blueberries now you can eat them
in fact
are you going a
for a hike with Mommy
to the to the cottage garden
yeah that's where we're gonna do our hiking
we can be bears
in the woods
I wonder if I should bring the backpack
huh
it's a little hard to do it if
just one person
you would like to hike on your own just walking wouldn't you
and if you wear sneakers then you'll have more traction and you won't slip
mm
like you did yesterday
when we were hiking and you had sandals on
remember
that was a nice hike we did
is something in your mouth
blueberry skin
mm I like that honey
oh is that the first time you're having the honey
no but I like
oh but it is nice it has a nice flavor
where we used to get crystallized honey all the time
I also like the texture 'cause it's semi_crystallized
mhm
yep
be nice to uh
be nice to maybe bring back home some blueberry honey
you can't really get it on the Cape
mm
we could maybe get a bigger thing or some more
I think I got that in Eastport
in Eastport
yeah
but there must be
y'know
must be all over
what did you say Naima about Blueberries For Sal
oh
kaplink kaplank kerplunk
what's that
mhm
then there was mother bear and little bear walking along
they were munching xxx
munching berries and swallowing them xxx
getting fat for the winter
xxx xxx
'cause bears sleep the whole winter
did you know that
they sleep the whole winter
and so they need to eat a lot of food before they go to sleep just like you need to eat a lot of food at supper+time so you'll have lots_of food in your tummy when you go to sleep so you could sleep all night
mm
bears sleep all winter
they sleep for days and days and
they sleep all winter because
they get tired
that's a good question
well 'cause they're tired I guess
'cause they wouldn't have much to do all winter so
they don't like to waste any time
they sleep
that's a good question
I think because she heard him outside when he was going xxx
and that
she was lying in bed
when she heard that sound outside her window
so she realized that she'd better do something or else she's not gonna sleep all night 'cause she'll be listening to the bear going xxx
that bear had a bad toothache
I guess he didn't brush his teeth regularly
that's why
so she invited him in 'cause she wanted to help him so that he wouldn't have a toothache so he wouldn't be making so much noise all night so she could go to sleep
I think that's really why she helped him
and maybe she helped him because she didn't like hearing him suffer and be so miserable
maybe she wanted to make him feel better just so he would feel better
well you know like Daddy said you could pinch the stem off like that and then you could eat the berry
yes
did you
are you eating yogurt too or just blueberries
yogurt
I haven't seen you eat any yogurt
'cause
you have
okay
whatever you say
why don't you take another bite of yogurt
aw please
please
please
oh okay
xxx Harbour
uh yeah Casko Bay doesn't
oh it's appealing to me
really
well it's a closed privacy xxx
yes Boo
I think the tooth was aching 'cause maybe he had cavity and maybe he didn't brush his teeth regularly
maybe he ate too much honey
maybe the bear ate
hey Naima
Naima
I said
yeah you know you're not supposed to do that
you're making a mess
you're playing with blueberries and squishing them and making a mess
and that is gonna cause blueberry stains all over the table that Mommy and Daddy are gonna have_to clean it up
y'know as you get a little bit older you're gonna have_to start cleaning up you own mess
and then you'll be busy
you'll be very busy
unless you be
unless you're a little neater
you'll be very busy
Naima is be a busy girl
you're gonna be cleaning up your mess all day long
no
the bear drinks out of a big glass
does he drink out of a big glass
I didn't see that
oh you mean if he had cavities
well I think if he had cavities it was because he ate too much
maybe too much honey
too many
oh maybe he ate too much
too much salmon oh boy
they do okay
I didn't know that
oh d'you think his mommy was giving him bear food like your mommy gives you bear food
oh
and too much salmon so he got cavities
actually Naima I think it might have been from too much honey
not too much salmon
well because sweet things are a little worse for your teeth
but actually blueberries might be okay
I wouldn't be surprised if blueberries had things that are good for your teeth in them
polyphenols
polyphenols of various kinds
flavonoids
yeah
in fact I'm sure someone's gonna have to look into the uh
content of this new polyphenol
in blueberries somebody needs to check whether blueberries have a lot of of polyphenols
speaking of which there are blueberries on the floor
oh
blueberries on the floor Naima
why are there blueberries on the floor Baby_oh
oh there's blueberries
Daddy's gonna get those blueberries
maloo
I see a lotta berries down here
Daddy's pickin' 'em up 'cause I don't wanna make a mess on the floor
blueberry stains are hard to clean
oh you're arm's meeting Daddy
very nice
Daddy's gonna eat some of these they look so good
mm mm mm mm
I think there's only like probably a couple minutes left on the battery
okay
so
can you turn it off and then xxx
are you gonna sleep Baby_oh
are you sleepy
you're in a bear cave
is it cozy
oh where are Grizzly and Sleepy
oh there's Sleepy where's Griz
Griz where are you
xxx that was funny the other day
we couldn't find Griz and Sleepy and then Daddy just tripped over the chest and knocked it over and there they were
may have been inside all along
Miss Naima you you
say that again
why did you want to go out with a bare bottom
you mean outside
I think 'cause maybe bugs would bite you on your bottom
did you want bugs to bite your bottom
you did
I didn't know that
why did you want bugs to bite your bottom
'cause it would feel good
oh
d'you think it feels good to have bugs bite you
I didn't think so
are you joking
I think you're joking
you're not joking
you're not joking
you're choking
you're not joking you're choking
oh my gosh
I didn't realize you're choking
xxx what does that have_to do with anything
Mom

I think Daddy might wanna curl up in that nest with you
because the sun is coming down on that
oh

mm
oh you're a little snake
snakes slide around and slither
d'you know how to slither
oh boy

I see
a water bear
want some help doing that
there
it's a cherry picker
look at that panda
well you know to be more stable you should go on the kitchen floor
well I would move it to
if I were making it stable I would move it to the kitchen floor 'cause that's more flat
put it
come put it on the kitchen floor and that will make it stable
it's okay just keep going
keep going
you're fine
I know
well it's okay
we'll fix it
like what
you did need a napkin
so I will get you a napkin
and you can wipe your own hand
on the napkin
does that sound like a good idea
well your hand's messy and you're making the table
messy
what are you doing
are you having
are you enjoying that pasta
is it actually good pasta
good
okay it's still the twenty ninth
of August
the previous taping was from this morning so there's been a bit of a gap here
would you like some juice instead of water to drink
okay
would you like
let me see what kind we have
we have grape juice and we have cranberry juice
alrightie
alrightie
and would you like to have some salmon or some crab
there's crab right there
it's right there on your plate
you would
are you gonna be a little king+fisher
oh that's right
bears do eat salmon
in fact bears love salmon
they do
where's the salmon
oh hey hey xxx
are you a bear zub
here's some salmon little bear
oh you're a king+fisher
you changed your mind
is that what you are telling me
oh

that's the top of the salmon
that's the color of the top of the salmon
you can eat that too
okay so my stuff is there
picked out
and um
that includes what I'm gonna wear tomorrow
so
so everything else in the other bag xxx
everything else is in the other bag
I zipped up my little section but there's plenty of room although all those are clean
do you want anything uh
washed
tonight
'cause I I kinda want my jeans
that's why I was gonna
I don't need anything washed but if
wash my jeans and my fleece
did I leave stuff out on the grass there
I might have
the little bear doesn't like her salmon
oh the king+fisher doesn't like her salmon
how 'bout if
yeah how 'bout if she just drinks a little there
birds drink water
xxx that baby bird is drinking juice instead
king+fisher has wings for flying
mm
what a sweet little king+fisher baby
hm after
you changed your mind
what baby are you again
what kind of baby are you Miss Boobahloo
oops
that's not to be knocked over Naima
you wanna take that off
okay Daddy will help
yes that's a very nice bracelet
it's a hair elastic bracelet
well it's a bracelet nevertheless
you turned it into a bracelet
'cause you wanted to
is Mommy wearing a mic
yes I'm wearing a mic
oh
yes I am
I'm sure all that noise is really
what
xxx I said I'm sure all that noise is really good
xxx well
that's just how it goes I'm afraid
so Miss Boo what else are you eating
oh Mommy's cleaning up
she's packing up some stuff
oh
is that a
no it's your feet
it's number
number one and two onto the window
oh
one two one two one two
is that number one two one two one two
hey there's a fly in this place
oh what're you doing
are you gonna
wave it away
gonna scare it off
uh y'know that's a bit of a challenge actually
it's a challenge to shoo that fly straight out the door
'cause flies don't
they don't like to be herded very well
they're not like sheep
sheep you can shoo into a particular spot
but flies fly wherever they want
xxx is there a fly on your sippy cup
no
oh you're shooing the fly away
good
oh I don't think these flies bite
I got a fly bite today though when we were out at the lighthouse
that was a
that was a very pesky Canadian fly and he bit me
well
I guess he was hungry
I don't think he was just trying to be mean and nasty
he was hungry
speaking of being hungry Naima what else are you gonna eat
you gonna eat some more penne pasta
good
I think Mommy put some crab salad there too
there's crab
you're a lucky king+fisher
is it possible to know which clothes you're gonna wear tomorrow
yes it is it's gonna be the black cords and the long sleeve black teeshirt
belts and socks and undies yep
actually I don't know if undies are in there
well I packed xxx
yeah but you packed three
who's in the dell
the zipper in the dell
the zipper in the dell
xxx hi ho the zippio
that's good the zippio the zipper's in the dell
that's pretty funny
that's what the
you did
what did the rising tide say to Naima
'cause that tide was coming up higher higher and higher and higher
because the tide was coming in
the water was rising and the water was coming in
and the water saw Naima and the water said I'm gonna get you
'cause the tide was rising
the tide rises twice a day
yeah
twice a day
that's two times
why
the moon pulls the water around
'cause the moon
uhoh another
is that
it's probably that same pesky fly
oh good idea
shoo it away
don't worry it's not a big deal Boo
forget the fly
it's just a fly
it's just a fly
we could open the door and it might fly out but in fact another fly might come in instead so
yes Boo
you think we should open the door
yeah don't worry
you want to thwack it
oh dear
oh dear
I think that fly flew away
oh I don't want to be a fly+swatter today
oh it's just kinda boring
it's boring
Naima you know what
just forget the fly don't worry about it
flies aren't that important
they're just not very important
uh it's not that you can shoo sheep
I mean you can kind of guide sheep to go to a certain place like you could make sheep go out a certain door but you can't make a fly go out a certain door
it's much harder
it takes great skill to herd a fly
why
'cause flies
oh I got a fly bite xxx because
that was like
uh I don't know what kind of fly that was
it was a biting kind of a fly
it was a Canadian kind of a biting fly
those were the kind of flies Daddy used to get bit by all through the summer when I was working in the woods
why am I Canadian
'cause that's where Babaji and Dadiji went
they came from India
they came from India and they went to Canada
so Daddy's a Canadian
ss
ss
what's ss
ss
oh
cats do that don't they
cats hiss
that cat was hissing at when the bears came in and ate all the blueberries in that story
when Bessie Ann
no
was it Bessie Ann
Bessie Allen
Bessie Allen and the dog and the cat came back into the house and the bears had gone the cat looked at her bowl and she hissed
just like that
are you gonna eat some food my dear
what
I thought you were hungry
would you like some salty cheese
would you like some
there's pasta right there
I see plenty of pasta
okay let's get you some salty cheese Booboo
