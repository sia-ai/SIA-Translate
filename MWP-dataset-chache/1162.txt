okay Franklin's class trip
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he had gone with his class to the bakery the fire station and the pet store
today Franklin's class was going to the museum
Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast
the museum had lots_of steps and huge doors
wow said Franklin it's big
it has to be said Beaver there are real dinosaurs in there
do you remember in New York we went with grandma xxx and grandpa xxx to the museum with the dinosaurs
yeah that's called the museum of natural history in New_York
Beaver had been to the museum before she knew everything about it
big dinosaurs she emphasized
so big that they ate trees for breakfast
Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch
Franklin sat down on the steps
what's wrong asked Snail
Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum
Snail looked alarmed
that sounds scary
and Franklin nodded
we're not gonna get that
in the museum lobby Mister_Owl went over the rules
no shouting no running and stay with the group
Mister_Owl said Beaver one more thing
watch out for the dinosaurs
Moose and Bear laughed
but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister_Owl
their first stop was the bat cave
it was dark inside
squeaks and squawks filled the air
what's that asked Franklin
Beaver giggled
that's the sound bats make to find their way around
Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
the class visited the rainforest next
Franklin climbed high into a tree house
he could see the tops of trees
can you spot any dinosaurs asked Snail
Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
xxx we saw knights in the other museum in New_York at the Metropolitan right
yeah
Franklin even got_to dig in a sandy pit
he was the first one to find an arrow head
it was just like being a real archaeologist
wow that's neat
an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
yeah
the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
yes agreed Bear lunch
Mister_Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
me too said Snail
you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister_Owl
eat up and let's go
reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
there was a loud roar
the floor shook and so did Franklin
ah
screamed Franklin when he turned the corner
