do you want to read Paddington
okay let Mommy go get Paddington I think he's in the kitchen
you're going to find it
oh here Mommy found it
find it
okay
okay we'll sit down
and we'll read Paddington xxx
do you know what this says
what does that say
this book belongs to Mommy
that's right this book belongs to Mommy
because it was hers when she was little
one day Mister and Missus Brown were standing in Paddington station
they were waiting for their daughter Judy who was coming home from school
Suddenly Mister Brown noticed something small and furry behind a pile of mail bags
look over there he said to Missus Brown I'm sure I saw a bear
a bear said Missus Brown in Paddington station
don't be silly Henry there can't be
but there was
it had a funny kind of a hat and was sitting all by itself on an old suitcase near the lost property office
oh as they drew near the bear stood up and politely raised its hat
good afternoon it said in a small clear voice can I help you
we were wondering if we could help you said Missus Brown wherever have you come from
the bear looked around carefully before replying
darkest Peru I stowed away and I lived on marmalade
Missus bear spotted a label around the bear's neck it said please look after this bear thank you Aunt Lucy
Missus Brown went off to look for Judy and Mister Brown took Paddington into the cafeteria for something to eat
he left Paddington sitting at a corner table near the window
he soon returned carrying two steaming cups of
tea
and a large plate piled high with sticky cakes
after his long journey Paddington was so hungry and thirsty he didn't know which to do first eat or drink
I think I'll try both at the same time if you don't mind Mister Brown he announced
and without waiting for a reply he climbed on the table
Mister Brown stared out of the window pretending that he had tea with a bear at Paddington station every day of his life
when Missus Brown came into the cafeteria with Judy she threw up her hands in horror
Henry she said what are you doing to that poor bear he's covered with cream and jam
at the sound of Missus bear's voice Paddington jumped so much he stepped on a patch of strawberry jam and fell over backwards into his saucer of tea
oh no
I think we'd better go before anything else happens said Mister Brown and he quickly led the way out of the cafeteria
Judy took Paddington's paw and squeezed it
come along she said we'll take you home in a taxi
then you can have a nice hot bath and meet my brother Jonathan
Paddington had never been in a taxi before he found it very exciting
and he stood on a little tip up seat behind the driver so he could wave to the people in the street
soon they pulled up outside a large house with a green front door
when they were indoors Judy took Paddington up to his room to unpack
he has a picture of Aunt Lucy
hm
next she showed Paddington the bathroom
as soon as he was on his own he turned on the taps and climbed onto the stool in order to look out of the window
then he tried to write his name on the steamy glass with his paw
it took him rather a long time and when he looked around he found to his surprise that the bath was so full of water it was starting to run over the side
uhoh
uhoh
he closed his eyes and holding his nose with one paw he jumped in
the water was hot and soapy and very deep and to his horror he couldn't get out
he couldn't even turn the taps off
Paddington tried calling out help at first in a quiet voice so as not to disturb anyone but then much louder help help
but still nobody came
then he had an idea
he took off his hat and began using it to bail out the water
downstairs Judy was telling her brother all about Paddington
when suddenly she felt a plop
looking up she saw a dark wet patch on the ceiling
Paddington she cried he must be in trouble quick
and they raced out of the room and up the stairs
Jonathan and Judy leaned over the side of the bath and lifted a dripping and very frightened Paddington onto the floor
what a mess said Jonathan we'd better wipe it up pretty quickly
oh Paddington said Judy what good luck we found you in time you might have drowned
Paddington sat up what good like I had my had he said
some time later a beautifully clean Paddington came downstairs
settling himself down in a small armchair by the fire he put his paws behind his head and stretched out his toes
it was nice being a bear especially a bear called Paddington
he had a feeling life with the Browns was going to be fun
that's right Paddington's lying on the chair with the pillows he's relaxing
ooh he's very comfortable
shh he's going to sleep shh
