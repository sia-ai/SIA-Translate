good Mark
what does he mean Ross
where do you think the policeman is Mark
do you think we are driving to find the policeman
what do you think we are doing
he said yes
trying to find the policeman
what are Mommy and Daddy going to tell the policeman
what are we going to say to the policeman
are we going to take our little boy and say to the policeman
here you can have our little boy he was bad
he took those stickers
is that what you think we are going to do
no
are we going to go to the policeman and say
Mister Policeman put me in jail
is that what you think
no
are we gonna go to the policeman and say
hi Mister Policeman would you like a cup of coffee
you know what we you know what we are doing now
we are not going to the policeman because we are never gonna go to the policeman
because we are not worried about those stickers
because we know that we're going to send the money back
we are not worried about it Mark
we stopped worrying about it a long time ago
only Markie is worried about it
we took it back to the place and they were locked and closed and gone
right
and so obviously they were not looking for us they didn't know anything about it they weren't worried they hadn't called the police
so we decided that just to keep it all honest we were no longer worried we were just gonna do the honest thing send our money back
we will do that when we get to Pittsburgh
we'll send some money back to them to pay for it
that's just to be honest
we're not worried that they are out after us with the police or anything
they are not coming after us
they don't even know it happened
there's no motorcycle men coming after us Mark
how do I know
because they would have gotten us by now
because that's the way the world works Mark
that's the way it is
we know how to judge these things
and when your parents get older people then you know how things work
and you can be sure
we are out_of the county where those cops those policeman work
right
we are into a different county now
they don't come this way
you know how in Dukes of Hazzard they have
you understand Mark
they don't work in this part of the country

Mark had left the breakfast table and then he came running back and he said
and then he said incorrectly but I can't remember how he said it
he said incorrectly may I be excused
he said it some strange way which I can't remember
but I corrected him and I said
I didn't correct him
I looked at him very pointedly and I said
you may be excused
saying it very properly
so he ran away from the table and he said
and he ran back to the table and said
and I looked at him again and I said
you may be excused
and he ran away and he turned around and he said
so on the third try he actually got it right would I may be excused is the interesting mistake trying to correct himself
