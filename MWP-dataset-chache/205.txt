an she knows terms like tops and pants instead of dress I guess
oh yeah
a dress
she hardly ever wears a dress though
um a couple of times she has she knows dress
you distinguished for her pants and jeans
does she call them one or the other
no
jeans is a word that she well she has used jeans because she says ginz um I think she that's another thing she hasn't usually worn she hasn't been wearing jeans that much but when she does I call them jeans
you talked about tying and untying the shoes and again you distinguished between shoes and sneakers does she play around with her shoelaces
no not usually
I just I have hard time getting her to sit you know to tie her shoes so I sort of like to I guess we talked about this last time her to know with the doll that she needs to have her shoes tied that that's what the ties are for
can she tell the difference between shoes and sneakers
yeah she can
I think I think she knows that though that the same word means both
things she usually calls she usually calls those sneakers shoes
but um when I say sneaks she c she says
sneaks
you said
just like yours
she looked
she understands then
just like yours yeah
with the dragon you got a bit simpler because instead of calling it a cage you called it a box
a box
I did that again I did that last time
no she still hasn't been to a zoo to see cages
she has um been to a zoo
and she has seen cages once
she has but she was sort of frightened um more than anything about the animals being in the cage
and she associated these bars with her crib because she said he went night_night
so um I didn't feel like I wanted to confuse it any more with the cage because I don't want her to think that her crib is a cage
so um I think that's probably why I didn't push it with the cage
there was this long discussion you had with her about
keys for the door
keys for the car does she fool around with keys a_lot_of kids do
yeah she does
she does
an she knows um she said that before that whole a segment of association with the keys and she has one for the beach too
um I don't know if other kids do this but and you just have_to mention one thing and she then will go remember um everything that she knows about about the beach or about keys
some kids call them car keys right away
she was cute with the dragon sticking her tongue out
do you play funny games like that with her
yeah we do when we have the time we try I think sometimes that we get too serious about doing our work and stuff but at least once a day especially before she goes to bed or something her father does a lot play funny games like that with her
does she have any puppets at home
did I ask you that the last time
will she put her hand in it
yup
she will
this is a little different though but she did put was able to put her hand in this and make it move
this time
she's got the term toys and toys encompass a_lot_of things
I know exactly why that is
it's because she bugs me at home when I'm in the kitchen and I've had more of a separation um of her toys
that dragon doesn't come out honey
her toys are in her room or the living room and they're not in the kitchen unless she drags them into the kitchen and they don't stay there very long
and if I'm doing something in the kitchen and I want to have some time to myself I will say to her
go and play with your toys
in your room' and she'll say toys and depending on how she feels she'll do it or not
she was very big on the chairs
does she have her own chair
um no
but she is fascinated with the chairs
she climbs up and down onto the kitchen chairs and highchairs all the time I guess it's just maybe meets her activity needs
something
she said
eat eat
she obviously associates them with
eating sitting in the chairs to eat
yeah that's right
buk
books right
she obviously has a_lot_of stuff in the the Pat the bunny book
yeah she has that book at home
you were trying to get her to distinguish the boy from the girl and she was having trouble with that
you know it's it's funny
I thought that she definitely knew that Paul was Paul or and Judy was Judy
because for a long time she's been calling them by their names
and doing it quite consistently
except today she confused them so
but you were trying to point out to her that one was a boy and one was a girl not that one was Paul and one was Judy
that one was a boy and one was a girl
well I think that because she's still she still calls all girls boys
so in the beginning all children were boys
and now they're either boys or girls depending on I don't know what
I've got something for her to eat
now I think she is calling when she sees a girl sometimes she calls it a boy and um more often than a boy called a girl
it's hard I don't think she really distinguishes them
she likes to read apparently and she had a_lot_of words in the vocabulary book for instance she knew the word comb
does she use one
a comb
no I use a comb though
and so she knows that I do and the brush although I use a brush for her hair not that often she doesn't know a brush I didn't think she knew the brush
she knew the eggs
yup
does she eat those
no uhuh
but she knows what they are
well actually I used to use eggs she does eat eggs I guess I should say she um sees them in the refrigerator and she knows she's not to touch them because they can break
so I use them in cooking
you have a back yard right
um a small one that she never really plays in
she was talking about picking flowers smelling flowers
um at her grandmother's house every time we go there she has flowers and she has Marie pick them
for mummie
does she like to pick the flowers
oh yeah
she likes to pick anything
if we go in the store she likes to pick leaves off bushes
she talked about patting them and later about patting the bunny
patting for her is well if she's not supposed to touch something to hurt it because she was patting the tape
I said not to touch the tape because we don't want to take it off and I might have said
Pat it
or something
she said
Pat
and she kissed it
and she kissed it
and then pat it
so that's another constellation of of um behavior that she has that um when she's to be nice and that comes from when she was starting to hit children
and children were beginning to hit her
the learning not to hit to be nice and that involves kissing and patting
she didn't do much with the blocks today she was most successful at lining them up on the floor
no she usually makes a tower
I think she was she was clapping for herself when she made a tower
like that she she felt that she was successful at that
the lining on the floor is just something that I did and I don't um I think she saw that that was something I did and that's another thing you can do with them
but I was having a hard time trying to think what we could do with them other than
you talked about things in the past going for a walk swings do you think that she remembers from day to day
I think she do I think she does
because I'm since I've been working I worked yesterday and I didn't see her
and I often ask her what she's done the day before
and she can tell me you know pretty truthfully and yesterday she did go with Susy for swings
but it's not sophisticated
it's just it's usually common activities but she's told me some
she went with Suzy or Annie for a walk
the walking thing was just in general
what does she do
when she walks she holds hands
with the other babies in her play group
www
ya wanna get out_of the chair Monica
no
she seemed to be into the phone although she doesn't say anything into it here is she into it at home
she never ss she ans actually insists that she talk on the phone whenever anyone calls but she never says anything but hi to them
pretty consistent with what she does with the real phone
she'll just say
hi hi
you said she likes this phone because it rings does it ring differently from her phone at home
no um I think she liked the ringing there are some when she plays with the phone at home she does play with it um at other times when there's no one there and she just goes up over to it and takes the receiver off the hook and goes
hi hi hi
but there's no ringing associated with it and that was more my suggestion that the phone this phone rings
but at home she can't make that phone ring at her will
this is very important to leave this on mummie
I'm gonna talk to Nan for a couple of more minutes
okay
she wants to nurse I think I can probably talk while she nurses
do ya wanna nurse
huh
you have_to leave that on
don't touch that though
don't touch
it's not touching this
it's just that it might be picking up her sucking
I don't know if it would or not
with all these toys that have insides and outsides like the cage and the house she's very much fascinated about taking things out taking things off putting things in
take it off
is she like that at home
what sorts of things does she
I think that she is
um take it oh that word that phrase she says
take it off
or um she ne she doesn't usually say
put it in
but
take it out
take it out
I can't think of anything offhand right now
but like her sweater something she'll wanna take it off
all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off and she's just beginning to dress herself and then she'll try to put it on and she'll say
put it on
but she has a little hard time putting it on herself
so I'm starting to help her do that
um shoes clothing
in general
does she try to pull things out_of other things
yeah she does but I can't think like just her toys
actually I'm probably not very good I don't know what she's been doing at school
I guess she's been going full time for four weeks
at school
and I have only been here with her um this week
or two days
so I actually don't have that much idea in terms of what she spends most of her time doing during the day
she they do have a_lot_of educational toys there that she's they said um there's this one toy there with pegs that they put inside
little holes
and that she's spends an hour trying to do that
and she's able to do it so that she is um fascinated with those kind of toys
don't touch
just don't touch that
okay you're going to have_to stop nursing if you touch it
does she understand the difference between things that are toys and not toys
I think she does
maybe in more of a negative sense than I'd want to
sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home she will be um in the way
and in the kitchen and I'll be tripping over her and say
Marie go play with your toys
xxx in your room
no she'll say
no
and um I think she does knows what are toys an what aren't toys also because I say if she's playing with something that she's not supposed to be playing with which could be harmful to her I might say
that's not a toy
we're not gonna play with that right now
although I'm not consistent because I do let her play with things that aren't toys that will not be harmful
such as make+up
when she was working with the make+up she seemed to know
parts that it goes on I don't know if it's helped her um I think it's imitative putting on lipstick and putting blush on her cheeks or something like that that she sees me do it and my mother do it and she's played a lot with my mother's pocketbook that's how she started doing that and my mother st showed her how to put it on
what parts of her face does she know now
I think she's aware of all parts of her face in fact um yesterday she learned gums her gums
and and she has words she says
for her face
um cheeks ears eyes brows tongue
gums
she was very aware of the tongue as a matter of fact she decided to call the dragon
tongue the tongue right
does she do that
pick out one characteristic
yeah
tongue
tongue
yeah there's that tongue in there huh
has she done that with anything else at home
let's see yes
my husband's been feeding her in the morning oatmeal
a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in it and she he found that she would eat it for him if he put she put she put raisins in it and she calls that whole dish raisins just raisins
you had to tell her a lot about the house
do you the she would have noticed that that was a house
I don't know
I don't think so
she may have
um but they don't look that much like houses to me
I think that's why I chose to tell her
that it was to just although of course she could have decided for herself that it was one thing or another
you have a what
what's in that
oh those are blocks
and what else is in there
it looks like a
