what Nathaniel
oh
vroom
I don't like milk in my coffee
well let's revise our game plan for the day

I was gonna go out and mow the lawn
oh yeah
we'll have_to save it again
it's raining out
what
to the rain
to the rain bee
what Nathaniel
I'll have_to show you all my new clothes
I've discovered these great places to buy clothes for no money

oh yes uhhuh
there's cottage cheese here too

when you rustle it you get a you get a xxx
and I've got the limiter on
really
yeah
Jesus
it's a very very sensitive um tape recorder
well we'll throw it away when we go upstairs okay
we'd like to leave it here so everybody can admire it for a while
we're so proud of you for only going pee+pee in the pottie
you've been dry for days and days now
that's called butter
it's called peanut+butter
it's called peanut+butter without peanuts
no peanuts in it
because it's not peanut+butter
I was pulling a hair out
so I didn't want you to get it in the butter
you gonna finish your breakfast
because hair doesn't taste good
it makes you feel funny when you get it in your mouth by mistake
sometimes there's some hair in your food
and you eat the food
and you get the hair in your mouth
you'd had that happen
you don't like it
you say echh Baaee ha a hair in my mouth I have a hair in my mouth
ded it out
it's what you say to me
because it feels yucky
it feels really yucky
well it doesn't hurt exactly
but it feels sort of disgusting
because it gags you
because it triggers your gag reflex
triggers your tongue does it
I know
just like Lia does
honey you don't have_to make funny faces you've already got one
you just leave your face the way it is
leave it the way it is
we think it's very funny just the way it is
oo that's even funnier
does Lia make funny faces
I thought it was uh Grandma Baum who made funny faces
how is Grandma Baum
and Grandpa Baum are they alright
you see what I mean
what'd he say
if you do address a conversational remark to him he's just completely
I'm reading the newspaper
I already tuned out
yeah they're okay
Russ is not in really good shape
he's too fat and has high blood pressure and
is he retired
no she retired
oh has she
just just now
I don't know why he didn't retire xxx
oh I know why he didn't
I don't know why she did
it's stupid to retire
it's the damnedest dumbest thing that ever happened to people
well you didn't like to retire
you didn't want to get up at six o'clock in the morning and spend an hour having a shit so the rest of you get dressed
Catherine I never said she retire
I can't believe you said that
well it is the reason she retired
I can't imagine you just said that
why does she have to take so long
well because she can't she can't do it after she puts her clothes on
so she has_to get up early in the morning and crawl around in her underclothes
oh I don't believe you're saying these things
until she feels the mood
and it's on tape too
it's on oh that's the worst
oh my goodness
I'll uh wipe this out before I give to to my transcriber
I hope you delete that little bit
you'll forget all about it
I'll swear my transcriber to uh
Elena has that
she's got all these tapes uh that she did of her mothers and kids
but she spent long time
you know Elena
yes
talking to the mother and she was going through you know six love affairs and and got all she's got it all on tape
she's sort of a history of her life
and that it's one reason she can't stand to go back and finish her thesis I guess she has_to listen
oh
you drank it up so it doesn't go down the wrong hole
good
not nice when it goes down the wrong hole eh
makes you cough
because you get a little bit of liquid in your wind+pipe
not not in your mouth
it's okay to have it in your mouth but you mustn't have it down here in the part that's only supposed to have air in it
where you breathe
juice goes down what you in the air pipe and it's supposed to go down the juice pipe
mhm
down to your tummy not down to your lungs
because if you get juice in your lungs you'll have pneumonia
it carries germs
and it hurts too
hurts quite a lot
when it goes down the wrong hole
and it makes you cough and cough
it hurts a lot
you were
what were you doing
you were you trying to imitate Katie
that's better
that's a good imitation
that's very good
yes yes yes
it's fine

that try was a good one
en there you go
well when I'm not taping you know xxx I put the things in xxx that I want to get
okay I'm coming now
that I want to get him to repeat or to you know to clarify because I'm interested in how well he does things like that
so it doesn't matter that the interaction that one produces then is a little bit forced
