okay it's right next to Manuela
can you say thank you
Frederic
all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old stone wall
in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty family of field mice had their home
that's right nuts and wheat
but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
and since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
and they all worked day and night all except Frederick
Frederick looks like he's asleep
Frederick why don't you work they asked
I do work they're carrying corn
I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
and when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the xxx they said
nuts and wheat
they said and now Frederick I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is gray
that's right
and once Frederick seemed half asleep are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
huh what's coming down
snow
the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones
um they're eating cookies wow they're lucky
in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats and they were a happy family
they were very happy
but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone and the corn was only a memory
it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
and then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words what about your supplies Frederick
close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed on a big stone I send you the rays of sun
do you feel their golden glow and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer was it Frederick's voice
was it magic
and what about the colors Frederick close your eyes again he said and he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush
and they saw the colors as clearly if they had been painted in their minds
and the words Frederick
Frederick cleared his throat waited a moment and then said as if from a stage aren't we lucky the seasons are four what if there was one less or one more
why Frederick they said you're a poet Frederick blushed took a bow and said shyly I know it
I know it
another book

um yeah
wow these are good very sweet
and uh so so now I have_to order them over the internet to get them because they don't sell them here yet but it turns out that the woman who lives who grew up a block from where I grew up in New York went to R_I_S_D too
so it was really funny
froggy log

firefly falls
and a a tree

acorn alley
huh lil miss spider's home she lives in the tree
should we read it
little miss spider got ready for school she packed her new notebook her pencils and xxx
peering outside she sipped tea from her cup and eagerly watched for the sun to come
up
she dreamt as she gazed her mind running through the wonderful things she'd learn how to do
huh wow look at all the things
she's painting
she's reading
she's doing science experiments
doing math she's adding her numbers she's swinging she's flying she's playing with a ball she's skipping rope and she's learning her alphabet too
mhm
sunny patch school was the best place to go to study lessons that all bugs ought_to know
there were classes and climbing and clinging to walls for hiding in bushes and curling in balls
she would learn about flowers from petal to root how to chew tasty leaves and tunnel through fruit
yummy
she gobbled her breakfast a fresh flower plate and ran the whole way to be first at the gate
the principal smiled as he pulled back the latch I know you'll be happy at dear sunny patch
but she found she lacked talent for hiding in trees for chirping like crickets or humming like bees
she hadn't the strength to drill leaves with her tongue and hardly the stomach for digging in dung
I am useless at stinging she said with a sigh perhaps I'll be better at learning to fly
there's little miss spider
she is sad
each student was tossed from a leaf of a rose poor little miss spider fell flat on her
nose
the school day was over they sounded the bell she sobbed is there anything I can do well
then she heard a bug cry I'm stuck in a spout and she climbed to the top and hoisted him out
that's the bug I think he's an ant
right
the principal beamed as he watched from afar he lifted miss spider and gave her a
a star
our gifts they are many we hop fly and crawl but kindness he said is the finest of all
huh sunny patch school
honey hive
froggy bog and taddy puddle
half in chump
huh little miss spider's home in a hollow tree
that's Wriggling_River
and primrose park
is that peach good
that's primrose park
yeah it looks like a big flower
like a big rose
hm
who's name is Rose
a flower
that's right the flower's name is rose
and you have a grandma Rosie right
and who's sitter's name is Rosie
that's xxx pole
who has a sister named Rosie honey
that is dreary dreary din
sweetie who has a little sister named Rosie
well papa Jay lives with grandma Rosie but who on tv has a sister Rosie
who do you watch on tv that you like that has a little sister named Rosie
Caillou doesn't he
isn't Caillou's little sister named Rosie
yeah
Caillou and his little sister Rosie right
and who do they live with
they live with their mommy and daddy
yeah
yeah it's a show that I mean she she's only been watching it maybe for a couple of weeks it's on in the morning and she doesn't I let her watch tv when I take a shower and um
and the stuff's all age appropriate in the morning it's just she get bored I think like she likes Rolipolioli but like it she watch it too you know a couple times in a week she'll be like xxx I'm bored xxx
yup
buy Caillou is really cute because it's a little boy with his lil sister who's a baby
she's probably like a year old and I guess he's supposed to be three or something but it's really sweet because all the stuff they do is you know being at the play+ground and the slide because it's too big or he's frustrated at something so he keeps throwing things or he tries to take care of Rosie by himself and um it's all very actually very appropriate situations because it's everything that goes on with her
mhm
I mean I don't really know how much she's taking in at this point but
yeah
are those yummy
it's on P_B_S
we have two P_B_S channels it's on twenty one
yeah
I have no idea I mean the Caillou the way they spell it's gotta be a french name I mean it's c a i l l o u
but I don't I have no idea I mean I don't know maybe it was a french show and they made it into to ya know
maybe yeah
I don't know what happens with the double l in french xxx but for spanish definitely xxx
yeah no french I think it's the same thing
um because like a the bathing suit like a maillot right that's what they call it has a double l
um he's a lil boy it's just a lil yeah they're just kids
is he a mouse xxx

who are Maisy's friends
Tallulah right
and Charlie
and Siril
and Eddy the elephant
right

hi honey huh what's Maisy making
lemonade with lemons delicious
didjou eat a lemon last night
did we go to a restaurant we went to Gregg's last night for dinner
um which is actually it's been the first time that we've actually been out since they started the kitchen
I'm like I'm never eating anything in this house again until this kitchen is done
because you know there's paper plates and if you heat anything in the microwave in a paper plate you have_to bring in
like a plastic thing you have to bring it up to the bathroom to wash it because we don't have water downstairs
yeah
it's hot today Maisy's having a nice cold drink mm lemonade
what's she drinking with
she have a straw
yes she does
Eddy's hot too so Maisy shares her lemonade
Eddy takes a big drink slurp
it's all gone poor Eddy he's very thirsty
but Maisy has an idea
she goes to the lemon tree in the garden
she picks some fruit with a little help from Eddy
in the kitchen Eddy squeezes lemon juice into a pitcher
Maisy adds water
then Eddy stirs in some sugar there a fresh pitcher of delicious lemonade
Maisy goes to get the cups slurp what's that noise
it's Eddy he couldn't wait but there's plenty for Maisy too good job
yeah

but doctor duck did not ask Felix's mama to leave the room doctor duck let Felix's mama stay with him the whole time
doctor duck listened to Felix's heart and looked into Felix's ears and took his temperature
then he gave Felix two spoonfuls of happy tummy and said call me in the morning
