in Hungarian it becomes a making making cartoon a csinalando cartoon
that is one that is being made
isn't that when they were showing how it is being made
mom

not in English though

uh www
www
www
www
www
www
www
why does Marky want that Darth_Vader case
it beats you
it beats me too
why do you want it
why do you want it Mark
it beats me on my bottom
it doesn't beat you on the bottom
is that what it means when you say
it beats me
is that what it means Ross
no it means I can't figure it out
he beats me on the head
no that isn't what it means when you say
it beats me Ross
think about it again
what does it really mean when you say
it beats me
you've got_to figure out something
what does it mean
okay you lost it
you lost the game Ross
you didn't figure out what it meant to say
it beats me
what does it mean
it hates me
it means when I try to figure it out I can't win
got your gun
bang
which one
got you bang
you don't got me gun
you mean she's got the wrong gun in her hand now
bang argh
oh it looks fine Ross
I have a gun too
okay maybe we'll need some light
on the orange side
is that where she is
how do you know
okay
well she's just turned a different way Ross
just turned a different way
it's the same gun
the bump is just because it's turned in in her hand
see you can see the bump on the side
that's the difference
no it's a different blaster
you're right
she's changed her blaster
it's a different blaster in her hand
you've got the wrong one there
this is the Princess Leia Organa
it came with it
if it came with it it must be the right one
you're right
maybe we can figure out what went wrong
maybe they took the wrong picture Ross
maybe they've got the wrong picture here
maybe they made a mistake when they made the picture
when they put it in the box
I see
so maybe when they packaged it up for the store they put the wrong one in there
do you think so
or do you think they made a mistake when they took the picture over here
when they made the gun and they put it into the box
and they gave it to you
do you think that maybe you made a mistake
well who made a mistake
not the person that chose the wrong gun
maybe the guy who made it made it right but somebody chose the wrong one
you don't think so
what if you go to the store and you're supposed to buy Cherioos and and instead you buy Raisin Bran
do you say that the guy who made the Raisin Bran made a mistake
no
you say that the person who bought the Raisin Bran made a mistake
he should have bought Cherioos
who made the mistake then
he made a mistake who made Cherioos
no Mark
he didn't make a mistake with Cherioos he made a mistake in that he bought the wrong thing
you understand
is that right Ross
I want apple juice gagoo
how do you say it
how do you say it Mark
want more apple juice gagoo
I want more apple juice gagoo
how do you really say it
how do babies really say it Ross
tell me the right way that a baby says it
well does he say
I want some more
what does he say
good
that's right
he messes it all up right
who else messes up words that you know
there's somebody else that you you know who messes up words
who else besides Ben
yeah who else
somebody in Star Wars
somebody in Star Wars
who is it
he doesn't mess up words
he just does that funny talk
who else messes up words
no Darth_Vader doesn't mess up words
Darth_Vader talks right
Chewbacca doesn't even talk so that's not the answer
who messes up words
who messes up words like a baby
who turns words around
uh huh
who is it
no
R_two_D_two doesn't even speak
Yoda
what does Yoda do
for example
what does he say for example
he says
the training you must complete
instead of
you must complete the training
he says
the training you must complete
away put your weapon
he says
away put your weapon
instead of
put your weapon away
right
did you know that he was making a mistake
did you know that Yoda was making a mistake
to tell him
yeah that would have been interesting
and you could have told Yoda that he was making a mistake
that's right
do you think you could really get into Star Wars
wouldn't that be fun if you could really get in there and really be part of it
uh huh
why
they don't play Star Wars
yeah
well maybe when you get some friends you can teach them how to play some harder games
do you think that these kids are too old for you
maybe these kids that you're in with are pretty big kids aren't they
have you ever played with really big kids like this before
okay let's hear you don't like
go ahead
do they really
you do
what do the five year olds do
they beat on you
they beat your words
that isn't fair at all is it
what do you mean they beat your words
the big five year olds do that right
you know what you can do
well that's one thing you can do
you know else you can do
you can get the four year olds all organized okay
get them into a a little group
get all the four year olds so they can figure out how to get those five year olds to stop it
what you need to do is get a bunch of friends and then if those five year olds come by and bother you you guys can work together and stop them
hide or play tricks on them
play tricks on the five year olds
you can stay away but I think the best idea is to play tricks on them
say
you five year olds are going to be the losers
I have a better idea
we're going to play trick on you
I have a better idea
petition
the four year olds can petition to have the five year olds removed
that would scare them away
that would scare them away
oh Ross
get all of your bunch to figure out a plan
okay can you do that that tomorrow
get all of your kids to figure out a plan against the five year olds okay
that would work really good
do they really have real guns
do those those five year olds really have guns
Ross what actually happened to the cat
you said you pointed to the door and she went in it or out_of it
did she go in it or out it Ross I want to hear the story
because you guys were outside right
we have_to say she was escaping from us
oh where were you in the basement
oh I see
so he was outside and he was telling the story
and he was chasing the cat and she was escaping from you
and then she went out the door
that's right
so she went from the basement out to the outside
so Ross had it right
you were on the inside
no I mean I'm talking about you
that you were on the inside when it happened
and she was on the inside
and then she went outside
okay I got it straight
you don't think you can fit through that little door
why
you really think you could make it through that door
no that's silly
you're too big
okay we'll try it
we'll try it
just for fun right
do you think you're really going to make it through
okay Ross is going to try to go in through the cat door
this is going to be the big experiment
Marky do you think you can make it through the cat door
no
okay everybody we're going to try and make it through the cat door
okay right through the cat door
in through the hole
maybe you'll be big small enough
okay try it to get through
now don't get hurt
I'll hold your hand
you might get hurt
are you afraid
is it going to work
what if you get hurt
it's not going to work
she's a lot smarter than you are
she knows how to do it
okay
he's got_to crawl down and he's got_to get his bottom in there
