that's good very good Joshua
whoo
yeah
did you get a blocks for your birthday
Kathy told me that you got blocks for your birthday
what colors are they
green all green or just some green
Brendon did you put one on top of that
that's really amazing
that took a_lot_of skill
you're very coordinated
it's hard
can you put one on top of that
can you put one there
yeh
here
put on on top of that Josh
very good
can you put one on top that Brendon
new block its not green is it
yes
yes
this is Brendon's hat
shall we put it on Brendon
pop
don't you look cute
okay let's build two towers
two tall towers
wall in the hall
well here here's a wall right here
the wall is getting taller and taller
it's a tall wall
don't fall off tall walls
the tall wall falls very nicely
how do you make a bed with blocks
can you show me
you need to have four posts right
and then you need to have a mattress in the middle
you could make the mattress out_of these skinny ones
that's right
line them up next_to xxx
you've got_to realize that you're dealing with a symmetry freak here
the mattress has_to be very even or it won't pass inspection
yes that is a red one
and it is a red big one too
in fact it is the biggest red block there is
good show Brendon
you're going to be army engineer I can tell
uhhuh
where does it go
show me where it has_to go
where it wants to go
wherever it might go
okay put it where it wants to go then
put it here
how many blocks Brendon
how many blocks xxx
green blocks
hello how are you
doing well
honey
no
okay
yeah
uh no
maybe
right out in front
well Trish will be here if I'm not
she's at the Green_star right now
oh
well she's working somewhere so track her down
so I'm watching the kids
and then and then when she comes home I'm going up to school but actually do you mean an hour and a half or for an hour and a half
oh okay
oh well
so I'm expendable huh
let me just check the sides to be sure
okay hold on for just a second
no honey honey
okay
hi sweetheart
good
no we don't have a radio
we xxx for the Gales
no
I don't know ask Andre
okay how's it going
Barb Barbara_Salomon stopped by
she lives around the corner and does day+care
and vaguely knows of the Tucker's
and she just left her name and number and suggested that sometimes if you guys are going stir+crazy in the cold weather that you get together and form a little social support group
yes
real well
he brought over some of his own toys today
a couple of Leggo style trains and um a xxx of blocks
battery operated
and there seems to be an awful lot less competition between them today
I think we should recommend to Kathy that she always bring some things of his or leave a few xxx
yeah
and just rotate them
because they're getting along really well
Brendon has nudged Joshua once in the last hour and a half and that's it
that's possible too
he might not feel as much competition xxx
because right now they're playing with blocks and crayons
that are not Joshua's and they are still doing fine together
okay we'll see you soon
love you very much
take care
byebye
that was mama Brendon
she's going to be home in an hour
Joshua look for another one just like it see
look here is another yellow wedge
see there is more than one of each kind of these blocks honey
and so if Joshua has one and you want it before you take it you should ask him before you take it
xxx duplicate
what's the matter honey
want to share some of Joshua's toys now xxx that he is sharing yours
how was your day at school Joshua

Brendon I didn't know you had real water in you could pretend to spray it but you can't really spray it
oh dear
Brendon if you do pretend spraying you can clean anything you want
okay
but water should stay in the sink or bath+tub or where ever it is
that's all
I think we ought_to take him upstairs
why don't we bring Brendon down
because he was xxx

Eric and Jane were friends and they both liked to use tools
when they put all of their tools together they had a hammer a screwdriver a saw a pair of pliers a measuring tape a wrench two flashlights an oil can a drill two paint brushes and some paint
Eric's mother gave them a tool box to put the tools in
it was too heavy to carry so they put the box into Jane's wagon
let's use our tools to help our neighbors
Eric suggested
that's a good idea
said Jane and they started off pulling the wagon down the sidewalk together
Miss Campbell had just finished putting up a new mailbox when Jane and Eric reached her house
they showed her all the things in their tool+box and Miss Campell asked if they would use their paint and brushes to decorate her mailbox
Eric and Jane painted it white with bright blue stripes
Miss Campell was very pleased
