no I didn't think it would fit either
the blocks
yeah
well because that really got her she was the most enthusiastic playing with that
does she have any at home
not like this
she has got um
actually I was gonna ask you where you got them she has got bigger and smaller ones she has got small wooden ones and great big cardboard ones
um but these are more fun to knock down
um hum
do you have any routines you play a lot with her
she seems to play a_lot_of hiding routines
yeah on the changing table I do put a diaper over her face and peek a boo with her
do you do it with blocks also
I have never done it with blocks before
I have never really been right in front of her and had blocks
usually you know if we are in this situation we are eating And there is no fooling around
um when you took the doll and the dog with her you tried to get her to do things you do at home
yeah like combing the dog and stuff
yeah does she do things like that
yeah
we have got a dog with a brush and yeah
and she combs her own hair
Loren has a couple of brushes and yeah
she has she has combed our dog before
oh I mean watched me and then you know had it in her hand but sh you know
she has also got some telephone routines
oh yeah
she has got a telephone
yeah and uh ours has a dial and I make it ring and she picks it up and says
Hello
and we usually pretend it is Daddy
he calls sometimes at home
we call him
yeah You want this
you call her attention to things like
look at the boy look at the girl
Do you think she knows the difference when you say words like that
no um That picture no no she might relate better to baby
a_lot_of times I call things baby or um We have a Richard Scarry book that has a baby bunny we just call him the baby
we call him baby bunny mommy bunny sometimes too but I forgot where I saw the girl
no and I do not think th uh these would probably be better just baby
but um since these were side by side did not hurt to differentiate I guess now a little bit
what are you doing
she likes to put things the putting in and taking out we have some stacking barrels and she loves the you know putting things Well she will take all the barrels out and keep the biggest one and fill it up with other things and buckets and with her small wooden blocks
she likes to put them away
her books right now
um I do not know why she did not really respond to t uh most of the pictures are bigger and uh and things that she can relate to better than chairs and cops You know more dogs and cats We have got a while book of dogs and cats the ducks are good the balloons We have one with a birthday cake and these flowers um she does not really wh I do not think can really relate to that very well
or just the plain blocks like that but it's characters doing something maybe but um Jim said she said book today while I was gone
she is really into books
she will bring books wherever you are in the house
she will go into her room and bring books out and she backs up to you and sits down on your lap and wants them read to her wants you to look at them with her
I realize that f the whole first half I was really directing her a lot and talking and as_soon_as I shut up she began to talk
I think that is that happens a lot at home too
I did not think she was saying very much but
before when you had I think it was butterfly the next time it was ladybugs or something but you called them all bugs
is that the way she the way she handles it
uh so far yeah
yeah it was ants I think the second time
does she know that they are
has she ever seen
an ant
a bug whatever
yeah yeah we have in the yard we point at them and stomp
they're carpenter ants
big ants
now can she name them can she say bug
oh yeah
and does she do it appropriately
yeah
yeah
because we've seen butterflies out in the yard we call that bug we've seen beetles and called that bug and ants we call bug
this time she named duck again
well she was saying duck and then she started consistently calling them chick and I didn't correct her because the ducks looked enough like chicks that
I didn't care
right
and you're not gonna quibble over things like that
no because not now not at this point
I think a little bit later on I mean if if it had looked a little bit mm more like a duck with a real distinct bill then I would've maybe
now you did this time call attention to boys and girls deliberately
do you do that with her now in the real world
does she know the difference
I don't think she knows the difference
she doesn't attempt to say boy and girl
well she was saying boy she said boy at one point in this book and that's part of the reason I was saying some boys and some girls
she doesn't say girl
um hm
you say good girl but she doesn't
she doesn't respond
now this time you used a bunch of parts of the body with her
I thought it was interesting
she's definitely got you used the word hand with her a lot put your hand in
oh well I never even thought of naming that
she knows that so well but we started with well the face and the foot
and she knows
oh the tongue and the teeth and the mouth and the nose and ear and eyes hair
do you play any games with her like stick out your tongue
Alice where's your tongue
where's stick it out
stick it right out
go
now she knows how to say shoes
and socks
does she know shoes from other things like sneakers and sandals
they're all shoes
they're all shoes to her
she knows socks
in the food book she pointed to she says juice
and then you sort of pointed out the other things that went with the meal
things like drinking out_of the cup
does she know those words because you named them and she didn't
um she doesn't use a bib so she doesn't know that word at all
and we don't say cup she doesn't use a cup she uses either a bottle or well kind of a glass but she doesn't use that word there's something else in there spoon she knows um
and soup
does she eat soup with a spoon
cereal and soup yeah
do you play kissing games with her
we kiss a lot
and we ask her for kisses a lot and she kisses her sister a lot we have some books that you smell and the smelling and the kissing got mixed up a little bit
at one point
but so the smelling the book let's see we had a couple a different things it just you know when we saw something cute or kissable we just kissed em
now because_of the puppy she's into biting so she's learned a new word from the puppy
well the puppy bites her
I tell her to tell me whenever the puppy bites and then we whack the puppy cause ya can't get that started I mean we can't let it continue
does she play with the blocks now
oh yeah we got some cloth covered blocks like this that we really like a_lot_of times we throw them at each_other
big new word is apple right
yes yeah
she always recognizes an apple
and she learned to say the word chair you were disappointed that she didn't say it
does she have her own little chair
well she climbs on everybody else's
no she doesn't
well yeah she has some
she has a set of chairs but it's really Lauren Lauren's set
is that a recent word
yeah I was surprised
about a week and a half ago she started saying chair and I thought that was not one of Laurent's early words but she could say it so
and she knows the word for key
yeah
and I don't know where that came from
does she play with yours
well occasionally
about a couple of weeks ago she had my keys where's Groucho
she can say Groucho and Chico
we've got these two cats that live in our house and she says Groucho and Chico
well a lit occasionally she does she'll reach for them when I'm going in the house and she'll say key
that's when I noticed that she could say it
and so I give them to her if she can say it
she can have it
she had trouble with the word ball
well she she says that a lot
is it perhaps because other words are now sounding like that
and you can't figure out what word she means
yeah
she used to say ball
well she calls balloons balls
and when she saw that she said ball right away
but she said it very clearly the way she used to say it
she's got some long sentences now
she has mommy see and of course all_gone but that's not mommy bye you know she wants to know she wakes up she wants to know where everybody is
daddy bye is daddy gone
or sister
and she says something else that I thought is a really long sentence
it has about three words in it
no
I don't
no Yeah well it's there is a difference in in books and stuff with boys and girls and I I just usually make the distinction between a boy and a girl
yeah I like to do that I don't I don't think she knows any difference I mean they don't look any different to her I don't think Yeah uh well not many of these These pretty new ones to her but with the things that she has at home she knows most of the different animals
she knows bird she knows a rooster she knows a cow a horse a dog a cat An' she know pigs Yeah those were new
she's never seen butterflies either She looks at them a lot
she she really likes books
she what she does mostly is look at them
and either you can ask her to show you what the different things are and she'll point them out to you or what she likes to do
probably more often is sit there and point to the picture
and have you tell her what it is
yeah most of the time
she usually she usually looks for what she wants
I use them both
a lot
sometimes I call them bunny rabbits you know I just do use them both
no
I don't think I every really thought about it
yeah I do I guess
I don't I never really thought about it much
I I talk to them a lot I think probably and I usually try to I guess try to figure out what they're trying to ask me or you know
um on her self she knows she knows all the face parts she knows her hair her head her arms she knows her knees her legs her feet her hands um I don't think she knows her fingers she knows her toes She probably she knows a good many of them
yeah just playing but she does
um she does zippers
she likes zippers
she's always been kinda fascinated with zippers She doesn't do anything else
she doesn't do snaps or button or anything
up and down which way
oh I think she knows when she is somewhere if I say to her
do you want to get down
that it means out_of where she is
down from where she is I guess she does know that
I think she does I don't really think she knows asleep as being asleep but she associates having your eyes closed with being asleep
and there's a cat in here that was asleep and she pointed that out
and she knows when yeah when your eyes are open it means you're awake
yeah um different from these but she does have some
um she stacks them some but mostly what she does is put them in a bowl She likes to put them in a bowl
and knock them over
we'll um I think dragons are a pretty distinct thing
you know I mean it's like saying it's a horse or a cow I mean it's a dragon
that's what it was
well if it's a dragon it's a dragon you know
I think adults probably associate bad things with dragons but
yeah
yeah I point out a_lot_of things to her you know we're usually pretty specific about what things are
I've even tried making a distinction between pigeons and other kinds of birds but I don't think that's worked out
um yeah yeah she's probably not as specific Well yeah she's good at it I guess I think she does yeah She knows arms legs hands feet and all the face parts
yeah she does
yeah well she just she kinda picks it up and um she makes like she's talking into it
The other day I was on the phone and she was sitting in the other room just jabbering away
like she was talking to somebody on the phone
a_lot_of times she um picks up the phone and then yells for me and passes me the phone like it's for me
yeah yeah she really likes playing peekaboo
she likes putting things over her face and disappearing And coming back
are you brushing my hair
are you brushing my hair
um No
I I think they probably understand maybe the same amount maybe a few different things but I think they're pretty much the same as far as understanding goes No I don't I don't think so I think they probably react diff a little differently um I I don't know but I I know that I just seem to have different com maybe a little different conversations with Amelia she she's a little more vocal than is right now
you know she kinda sits there like she's talking to you sometimes you know comes over and tells you a story
doesn't really do that
she does once in a while but not like Amelia does
no I've been reading to them a little bit but they don't pay any attention they just want to point out the pictures Yeah this one
that's that's about all she does
she she does that and she points or she brings me somewhere if she wants something
um otherwise she doesn't I don't think have any specific sounds for specific things that I've noticed anyway I haven't picked any up
yeah the same way
are there some of these books that are better for her stage than others
are there words in some of these books that are more familiar than some of the others
well she knows baby and flower
and um ducks
and birds
and she's easy to pick she can pick those out pretty easily
she was also looking at the truck and dog and screws and sneakers and shoes and boats
house and owl does she understand any of these words
yes probably everything but the mouse and the owl
does she tend to say those words at home
she tries to say boat
we have a boat
so she's familiar with that
she um she does say dog I guess
yeah she does say dog
we have a dog also so
would you like a cat
do you know anyone who would like one
no
my mother's trying to get rid of some cats
she's always saying dam wan or du dat
is that supposed to be
what's that
I don't know
well I thought maybe she was she was saying
another one
because I was saying that to her
you know and I think that's something I probably say to her a lot
and she was doing that pointing to the same thing
I think she has another expression for what's that that sounds almost like she's saying
what's that
yeah she's always asking what things are
you know in new books or anything she always wants she always points things out and wants to know what they are
you indicated that she was going to like one of those books because it had paper pages is there any significance to that
well they don't have any books with paper pages and they like to do things like rip up the tv guide
and things they like to rip up things with paper pages
has she gotten to the point where she can manipulate
she appeared to be having some difficulty with the clothing on the doll she's interested in trying it but can she manage any of those skills on her own
she can take her clothes off
you know she can't put her anything on
but she she she does try to put things on
she was interested in the sneakers
yeah
they have new sneakers
and she tried to untie
yeah she unties her shoes and takes them off
and then she comes running to you and wants them back on again
no she usually doesn't want them back on again
what do you want
this
she really got into the word flower
yeah she's been saying flower for a long time
what do you want this
it's not a baby it's a boy
looks like a baby to you I guess
another baby
she's very interested in putting the dog in and out_of the house
is she into putting doll furniture into houses or anything like that
no
she really wanted to open and shut that door so much
does she do that much at home
no she doesn't
does she understand the terms house and door
well I don't know
she knows what house and door are at home but I don't know if to her that looks like a house
or a door
she was pointing to the words on the paper
yeah I usually point out
words numbers that's probably why she was pointing them out
does she understand the word
words
no she doesn't
but she does pay selective attention to them
I think that she knows that they're different than pictures
she was really into the textures in this book here the way you can feel the face and everything she doesn't have one of these does she
no
but this book rips apart
has she got any new routines that she didn't have the last time we talked
I don't know
I can't think of anything really
today she had many more words or things that sounded closer to words than before
does she attempt to use them with
does she talk to
she talks to but never sounds like she's saying anything to me you know when she tries to say things to me sometimes they sound like words but when she tries to say things to they don't sound like words
they kind of babble back and forth to each_other
and at this point you would say that Amelia has a vocabulary of how many words
um I don't know
maybe six seven words one two probably has two
yeah says Grover and
she has words now doesn't she
oh yeah she does
she spent a_lot_of time talking about the dog
and she especially mentioned the house
she has the word house right
does she know it for real houses and play houses does she use it consistently
well she knows real houses she doesn't really have anything that are play houses
well well Kristin does Kristin has a doll house that she knows
and she says what
hau
oh I don't know it
and she knows the door and everything
she wanted something to get out or something and she said
take it out
or
it out
or something
she says she says a_lot_of things like that that sound like she's saying sentences without them being words
you know like she says something like
I wanna walk
and the only thing you can really understand is the walk part
she wouldn't play with the phone
no
well there was nobody talking to her
that's interesting because many kids prefer toy phones to real phones real phones scare them
she doesn't have a toy phone anymore
she used to but she doesn't any more
and um she's only had contact with a real phone recently
does she talk on it
she listens She doesn't talk much she listens more
that's the dog's
it's funny because she said No when she picked it up
is that because there was no one there
that disturbs her apparently
well it didn't do anything I guess for her
she's very good at grooming the dog Does she play at grooming animals
um no
she just she brushes her own hair but she doesn't she doesn't really br I guess she brushes her doll's hair
she's really good at looking for the parts of the animal
she was good at identifying the eyes although she got confused with the mouth
the nose it looked just like the eyes
and she knew where to look for the mouth
and was disturbed when it wasn't there
and I think I was really surprised when you said
Where's the tail
she went and looked right away
we have a dog
so I think that's probably why
ya wanna go in there
does she play with the dog's tail
yes
she hangs onto the dog's tail and lets the dog pull her around the room
she puts the dog in the house but you don't have a doghouse for the dog
no
now with the dragon She seemed afraid of the dragon but then after she saw that it was her own that she could make it move
I think she was afraid of it because it moved
uh huh but after she put her own hand in it
yeah then it was okay
does she have puppets at home
um no
so it's new for her to put her hand in and make something move
um they have had a puppet I can't I can't remember They they really have gotten out_of playing with toys
recently they go outside a lot they um play with cards that's their new thing cards And they have the a peg thing you know with a hammer I'm sure you've seen those and they play with that constantly
you know they like things that do things
the book that pleased her the most apparently was were the two books with just pictures with one picture on a page
does she seem to prefer those kinds of books
yeah that's mostly what she's got at home
although she now likes to look at magazines She likes to look for um babies in magazines
and kids
how did you get that out
that's the first time anyone got that out
I did it The first time I could get it out though
of the books though does she seem to prefer
the books she has are very simple
probably because I prefer those kind of books
not you look at books that have a cluttering of things on the pages and you can't really pick anything out
she was good at turning the pages when you asked her to
does she do that by herself
um hum
so she'll sit there and just flip through
yeah
she doesn't need help
no
I marked down here that you were supplying the words for some things and some things she was naming for instance you named the cat and then later on she named it for you can she consistently name a cat
no she's usually very good about it I don't know maybe that didn't look like a cat to her at first
she picks out cats very well
she didn't name the boy and the girl
she pointed to them but she didn't name them
no
she calls them kids
a_lot_of times
do you want this in
I just had it in and there you wanted it out
she did notice the dogs that she had a word for
she calls the dog her name
she knows the word chair
a couple of kids her age have recently been fixated by chairs does she enjoy climbing in and out_of chairs
yes she does
does she have her own
no just her high+chair
www
you don't want this
alright why don't you go put it away
can you go do that for me
she obviously doesn't like help getting in and out_of
no
now with the crayons she didn't say crayons but she knew what you did with them
does she play with them
yeah
she does
she scribbles with them
and she knows that they're for writing do you think that was what she was saying
yeah she was saying write that was what she was saying
with a_lot_of things you were giving functions so_that with the chair and the cup it was to sit in and to drink milk Does she understand those functions I mean does she Are you trying to add words
no I think she understands
and she uses a cup so she knows what it's for
yeah she knows
I think she understands those
just pull it out it'll come out
another word that she had and I wonder if it was from the summer was hole Was she good at making holes
she likes holes
now with the blocks
she used to just carry them around in a bowl what does she do now
oh yeah she likes to stack them she likes to knock them over
so she's not just carrying them from place to place
no
she's trying to build with them
um hum
the last thing
she was noticing the cow and the bird and then she had trouble with the whale she thought it was a bird
and again you said the bird is to fly
she knows birds fly
she says that a lot
birds fly
because we feed the birds and then she watches them fly away
you're gonna put the brush in there
she was real good at knowing all the names on the dapper Dan
she calls all fat we have several Hupty Dumpty's and she calls all fat stuffed toys Humpty Dumpty
I noticed I noticed there's an several other play areas where we are an she calls them all Humpty Dumpty
I don't know why
it's a familiar familiar character I guess
she seemed to know the difference between buttons and snaps
yeah she knows buttons and snaps
she can't do them
she can't do them but she knows when we do them
she can't motor do them
but she recognizes the difference between all of them
I think so
snaps is odd except that all baby uh uh t+shirts have snaps on so they're introduced to snaps very early
you'd think that zippers would be easier to manipulate
no they're not
they're two+handed
I mean you have_to hold one and pull with the other
who are you calling really
