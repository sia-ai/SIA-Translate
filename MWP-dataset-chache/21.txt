very good
very good Ross
did you learn that in preschool today
how did they teach you that
how did they teach you that
you mean you just learned it
do you like to add
do you want to add
let's do seven
I've got an idea
let's do four plus two is how many
very good
and four plus three is
four plus three
is that five
count them again
so four plus three is how many
do you see them
here's the four and here's the three so how many does that make
okay good
still seven
it doesn't matter which way you turn it it's still seven
oops
no now you're messing up
count them again
don't count thumb

you're going to learn it wrong
you weren't going to help him get dressed anyway
I bet you can't break it off now
yeah you wore both of them
what happens in a war Ross
and what if you say
I wore my underoos
what does that mean
uhhuh
are they the same word
what's the difference between wore my underoos and I am going to the the war
what kinds of things does war do
but what about when you wore your underoos
it's not the same
why
because it really sounds like wear
uh huh
right okay
and they don't take guns
guns
it's not really shooting guns
okay
now let me ask you another question okay
do they sound the same
war and wore don't sound the same
which one sounds different
how do they sound
say them both
war
which one means war
what does that mean
that's when you put it on your body
so you say
I war my underoos
but I'm going to war Uh uh no they don't sound the same
okay say it in a sentence go ahead
you can't think of a thing to say
how about what you said a little little earlier about the underoos when you said
I wore both of my underoos
try it
you're doing fine go ahead
yeah
no you ran out_of energy
okay how about I'm going to go to war
how about Star Wars can you say that
I can't hear you
you don't want to hear Star Wars
say it a little louder
what's the the name of the thing you want to hear
not loud enough
they won't be able to hear it
okay but what's the word wars
good
he's making a choo choo train
no books yes books
daddy likes cheese
is that right Ross
okay and you're a big boy and you don't like it so_that proves that at least some people who don't like it are big boys
they like it
who likes the cheese
and who doesn't like the cheese
and that's why you don't like it
and who does like it
because I'm a big boy that is tall
and how about a little boy that's that's short
do they like it too
so these are the people that like cheese
what kinds of people are they
are we big or short
so do big boys like it
is he big
does he like it
he's not big he's little
so some big boys like it and some little boys
not that big
not as big as you are

what's wrong with that
you mean the Darth_Vader head

the Darth_Vader collection case
cause you don't say caser you say case
case is not a verb
do you want to give one to Mommy

mommy's got a bunch
mommy's got more germs than anybody else
how about you

I have a spoon in my cereal
are you mad at me Honey
I thought you said
I give up
why
but was it really bad
did I really hurt you in any way
so why should you really really be mad
you don't have a good reason
you don't have a good reason
are you a little hungry
are you really hungry or just a little hungry
would you like some cereal
here's some I cooled down and put syrup in
yeah but you can start on that and it's not hot
this is too hot for you
okay
I knew that was going to be hot
that's why I gave you that though
after Daddy's nap
go take a bath
Marky's in there
go on in any way
no they fit me
how do you say it
no Honey
you don't say it that way
no you don't say it that way
you say
they fit me
they used to fit me
can you say that
they used to fit me
you see he wants to make the contrast and I see his point of view
can you say that
try that
is that too hard
how about this one
did they fit you
or you want to say
did they fitted you
which one is better
did they fit you
or
did they fitted you
fitted you
did they fitted you
I see
didded they fit you
no that's silly Mom
no they used to fit you

Ross
see those words are really hard
fit fitted
and you don't say
Daddy did you hit the ball
okay Daddy did you hit the ball
you don't say
Daddy did you hitted the ball
Marky Daddy Marky hitted the ball
that's not right
you say
Daddy
Marky hit the ball
uhuh I'm a baby
I'm a baby
what about the bad pig
the pig blows our house down
no that's not the way story goes
who blows the house down
no
the wolf blows the house down
we're not pigs we're wolves
sure you knew that silly boy
you just forgot it
you could fall and get hurt Ross
baby wolf you'll get hurt
baby wolf you'll get hurt
baby wolf will get hurt
you could
you could push too far and you could fall
okay if you fall it wasn't my fault
it was your fault
it's dangerous
it's dangerous
Ross turn around and do it the other way so_that your feet go that way and your head comes towards the bed
yeah that's not so dangerous
yeah so now if you fall you'll fall back on the bed
that's it there go ahead do it
it's the better way to do it
Ross's mouth hurts
were you guys good
oh he didn't finish his lunch
I finished my lunch
yeah I did
oh I'll see when I get home
no it's on the outside of the earth
I'll show you tonight
you mean on this new record
I'm going to use it on the floor
I never get cut
what's the real name of that
what's the real name
what's the real name
small twerp
what do you think
god
god is mean and the Devil is mean
how come he'll do that
I thought he was a nice guy
he puts
is that for their own good
Ross said that
in other words she had enough money to buy it so he said she has the cost of it
Rossie said that
I said
no that's the Daddy one because we had been playing that it was the Daddy one a little earlier
Rossie said
well I said no that's the Daddy one
Rossie said not Markie said
okay well Rossie said anyway
no you say
he is bigger than him
or he is bigger than he is
I'm sorry
he is bigger than he is
but Marky really likes to take things in the bath
that's his biggest pleasure
but Ross Mommy didn't say raw she said if the strings get rotten
no if they rot
oh if they rot
if they rot
I see
if they rot
now that's different between getting raw
if the strings rot
do you understand what it means to rot
you don't know
it means first they start out and they're real strong
and when they rot they f start to get weak and they crumble
who
Marky to get in
oh the Wompa
doesn't want it to get in
the Wompa's an animal
who
Marky or the animal
Wompa
do you think Daddy has a hard time listening
what is wrong with your daddy
what is his basic problem
even when you speak really well and have clear words right
maybe Daddy doesn't hear very well
maybe his ears aren't good
mm hm
thanks
thank_you Ross Honey
if I give you two more how many do you think you will you have
now if I give you two more how many do you think you will have
now Ross if I take away four cookies how many do you think you're going to have

four out_of ten
you've got ten right
no count the whole bunch

he really needs it
he's going to cry
but that's not true
I know that Mommy bought you the Tauntaun and the the Wompa for Mark
how come you're yelling so much
well you know I bought both toys for both boys but the way I gave the toys to them I gave the Wompa to Ross and the Tauntaun to Mark
oh you're right Ross
you told me the truth
very good
this is Wompa
you want Tauntaun
I want Wompa
you want to play with Wompa for a while
you don't want to play with with Tauntaun
yeah the Wompa's strings
in other words you were afraid that Marky might get the Wompa strings
no he's not taking a bath
it's only when he takes a bath that we have_to be careful of our toys
right
that's the only time
what about the Tauntaun
should we put the Tauntaun in the water
he shouldn't go in either
you know he's got a large cavity
he'll get full of water and he'll do too much pee pee
he'll get too much water and he'll go pee pee
he's got a spring in him
yeah he might go pee pee
he might go pee+pee
in Star Wars the Wompa
and who saved them
I guess that's what B_J
and the bear was all about
P_J
and the bear
was there a bear on that
P_J
and bear
Ross well first you go down and see if both cars are here

he's not a letter
and all the people that have animals

there's somebody else who loses his shirt
sometimes he's real big and then he takes his shirt off
who else Ross
who
just tell us
no
he has a shirt
he doesn't have a shirt on
I don't know about these superheroes without their shirts on
how come he doesn't wear a shirt
I know because it'd just get wet
it'll get wet
mm hm
that's right
when did you have them before Ross
were they good then

at preschool he was mad at Ross and he said
you give me a headache
Mark said that
yeah Mark said to Ross
you give me a headache
isn't that silly
do you think you really give him a headache
he just seems to make you mad right
what should Mark have really said
no
where do you think he learned about a headache
I think it's from Mommy
Ross says that
Ross says it
did you teach him that
yeah Ross says
you give me a headache
he does
yeah you must have taught it to him
you know Ross Marky learned a_lot_of things from you
did you know that
he does
he's learned a_lot_of things from you
no from you
he learns them from you
he learns more things from you than any one else
you're his only big brother you know that
does he make you mad
nobody gives you a headache because you're a happy boy
because you're a happy boy right
did you know that your little brother really really loves you a lot
a whole large bunch
do you know why
because he likes to follow you and learn from you
the first boy that gets up on the table will get a spanking and be sent to his room

okay then let's just not get into a problem
let's just get presents when Daddy says that's it's okay
that's one time it's okay but it's also okay when Daddy wants to do it
so we have_to have Daddy wanting to do it before it happens
that won't work Ross
you'll just have_to wait until Daddy gives it to you
now you know I've got a_lot_of presents I'd love to give you but we both have_to wait until you're super good
I know it makes you nervous doesn't it

put a little tummy on you
you need a little tummy like your big big fat daddy
don't you want to be like your big fat daddy
you don't want to be fat like your daddy
look at that fat tummy
you you don't want to be fat like him
