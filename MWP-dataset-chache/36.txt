about the Ewoks
yeah
oh Marky has another part
okay go ahead Mark tell us the the rest
oh really
uhhuh
mhm
mhm
mhm
good good good
and then tell me some more Mark
I see
I see
uhhuh
I see
visitors
uhhuh
uhhuh
mhm
now that's nice Mark
do you have any more parts to that story
okay
okay
mhm
uhhuh
mhm
I see
mhm
and is that the end of the story
what happened at the end
and they lived happily ever after
uhhuh
okay now everybody want to go to sleep now
good_night darlings
I told Ross that it wasn't wouldn't be fair to cry just because I'm giving a Trono to another boy that's Adam Just uh he shouldn't cry because it makes me think that he doesn't want the other boy to have something nice
and what did you say then Ross
actually he said
you know the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if
uh and I never could have gotten one
how would that have happened Ross
oh I see
I see
you think it might have worked that way
mhm
I see
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the Trono was for you
and why did you think that
and I wouldn't and you said I would I w
you said you wouldn't have hided it or wouldn't have hid if it had been for me
isn't that what you said
how did you say it Ross
because it was yours I would have hid it away
do you think it's somebody else's
why do you think that
no no
okay but you but you thought you say that you think it's for you
why do you think it's for you
and why did you think so in the first place
what was the reason
no and the reason was no the reason was that you said that I didn't tell you who it was for
if it was yeah if it wa if it was hi if I was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for Adam I wouldn't try to hide it would I
uhhuh
so do you still think that reasoning is good
do you still think that's that's good thinking or have you changed your mind now
who do you think it's for
uhhuh
if it's for Adam then why not show it to you right
then I do show it to you
uhhuh
well I'm not going to show it to you so what does that mean
you you think now it's for you
are you sure of that
maybe I'm just hiding it from Adam
so you think that's a pretty good uh okay
so what how do you feel about it
who's it for at this point
who would you guess
who would you guess if you had to guess
is it for Ross or for Adam
you're not sure now
now daddy keeps on telling you it's for Adam right
so you can't make up your mind can you
well it's tough isn't it
what
no way
daddy's are not supposed to tell
daddy's are never supposed to daddy's
how do you know that
mhm
you know something Ross
you're right
you're right
it's for you
yes
it is
it's for you
you guessed it
because if I hide it there's no way that I would hide something that is for Adam if it's for Adam why should I hide it right
the only reason I should hide it is because I don't want you little kids to see it
you got it right
you got the right answer
yes son
what
Trono
yeah I know the whole story
it's the first book of Tron before there was Tron
there was a Trono
that's part of the whole that's part of the the trilogy
