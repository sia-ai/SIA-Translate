thank_you Mark
mm
do you know that song
everybody's vote
he'll go into the office and say into the Presidency
well he's already there but continuing he'll say
I can do anything
everyone loves me
but what we're hoping is that Mondale will get enough votes that that the democrats can look at Reagan later as president and say hey you won it's true but you didn't win win that well
there are a_lot_of people out there who don't like what you're doing and you have_to tame it down
you gotta
right
you gotta do what we tell you
we're trying to represent the people and we're trying to tell you what the people out there want
now Reagan won't listen if he wins too
right
well
too easily
but if he's given a little bit of a
right
run for it
I'd say also Mon Mondale still has a chance but it's it's a very very slim chance
pretty slim
it's pretty slim
it certainly would be interesting if he won
right it would be a it would be a real real
who you voting for Mark
who are you gonna vote for Mark
okay
who are you voting for for Vice_President Mark
who are you voting for for vice president
no
Geraldine Ferraro
or
okay
mhm

Mrs Mondale

they're two different families
and then there's Bush
you know about Bush

Ross doesn't wanna vote for a Bush
I'll betcha if Bush ran against Mondale
Mondale would probably win
I don't know if that's true
I'm not saying that Bush isn't good
I'm not
than Reagan
I sort of
I just sort of think that somehow Bush would lose it
I mean stupidity has_to win out

not a very funny joke was it
a_lot_of people freaked out Ro Ross
a_lot_of rather important people
the Russians weren't very happy
the Russians were not real pleased
how would you like it if somebody destroyed your whole country
how would you like it if somebody made fun of something that important

poor little what about the poor kids

I talked to a teacher and she said that uh
teachers
teachers were very she felt that the teachers were firmly behind Mondale
strongly Mondale
yeah I know there's not much doubt about that
but it doesn't seem to transcend to the
it's funny
the rest of the community
