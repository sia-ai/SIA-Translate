Pete or the best xxx xxx word book ever
Pete this is Lily's new favorite book
oh that's so cute
wait until you hear the story
is it sad or
it's um quirky
to say the least
it's one of these children's books that's written more for adults than kids
okay come sit with me lemme put Ben down
uh
have I got a xxx
she actually loves it
I didn't think she was going to like it
because it's a little sarcastic
but hello
hello there
are you gonna help me read it
my name is
my name is Poppy Wise
and this is my little brother
Mooky
and this is my dog
Pete
a good dog
a very good dog
but sometimes he is not so good
and he eats what he should not
what does he eat
I will start with the letter a
he ate cousin Rocky's accordion
all of it
he ate a bouncing ball that belonged to uncle Benny's dog Buster
Buster is no bargain he barks all the time
but still
he did not eat the cake from Olga
or the creamy cupcake
no he ate my
camera
I love to take pictures
look here's baby Mooky eating noodles
and here's my best friend Doreen Parsley the great dancer
he ripped the head off my dear doll Dinky
dreadful dog
while Doreen and I
that's Poppy Wise
and that's Doreen
while Doreen and I were making egg salad sandwiches for the egg head club
Pete ran off with everything
the egg slicer
the egg beater
the egg sandwich
the common cuckoo egg
the
emu egg
and the
the chinese bobble egg
he ate a
fez
Fez is also a city in a country in Morocco
on a continent called Africa
not everyone in Fez wears a fez
who's that
that's Poppy Wise
and there's Poppy Wise again
those are the twinkle twins
that's Mrs Hooginschmidt
while the twinkle twins were gluing together Mooky's halloween costume
Pete gobbled the glue stick with gusto
goofy gluey dog
he ate half of my homework
but did Mrs Hooginschmidt believe me
ha hardly
she's wearing an orange coat
and a skirt
right maybe a dress you can't see
under the coat
when I turned my back for an itsy iota of time
he ate my beautiful pink ice pop
in a jiffy he ate twenty five
jelly beans
and jumped for joy
he ate Mooky's magic key
the key opened Mooky's secret box
what is inside is a secret but I will tell only you
it's his kazoo
at the lucky dog show he ate all the leashes
which let loose all the dogs
who ate all the lemon tarts
and drank all the lemonade
and Mrs Parsley was
livid
I don't wanna make a mountain out of a mole hill
but he ate Benny's money
holy
mackerel
now Benny has no money to buy Buster a new ball
which you will remember Pete ate many letters ago
once in a while we go to the woods
and Pete is perfect
then I'm at the opinion that this dog is okay
oops we're up to p
he ate Mrs Parsley's pink pocket book
and she said take that Pete back to the pet shop
and get yourself a polite pooch
those are the twinkle twins
mhm
poo on Mrs Parsley
quick question
would you love a dog who ate your lucky quarter
a q from your alphabet collection
and your porcupine quill
even if for the quadrillionth time you said quit it
don't eat that and he did
would you still love that dog
quite a lot
one rainy day he ate a rubber glove
and the rubber band necklace that Mrs Parsley wore to a meeting of the rubber band society
Roberta Rothchild is the president of the rubber band society
now Pete bounces around the room
he ate Mooky's stinky sneaker for breakfast
Doreen Parsley's sandal for lunch
Rocky's pointy shoe from Japan for dinner
and a soft suede slipper for a midnight snack
the twinkle twins have a dog named Twinkie
Twinkie may look insane
but she does not eat their things
Twinkie looks like she's got like sticks coming out of her fur
should we show should we show Manuela a picture of Twinkie and the Twinkle twins
they're wearing pink dresses right
you can understand I would be unhappy to say this but
Pete ate cousin Rocky's
underpants
ugh
while Mooky was playing the violin
very badly thank you very much
Pete ran off with the veal roast
very angry hungry family
those are the twinkle twins again
what can I say
there's Poppy Wise
in his wallet Rocky keeps a list of all the times he was insulted in his whole life
it use to look like this
right and now it looks like this
wow
when Pete eats extra crunchy extra cheesy cheese doodles
he turns bright
orange
yikes
he ate Mooky's yoyo
my yoyo
right they were wearing pink dresses
now they're wearing blue dresses
my yoyo
Doreen's yoyo
and the yoyos of the twinkle twins and now there will be no yoyo contest
oy oy oy
