once I watched a turtle
it's called the traveler
once I watched a turtle who wasn't watching me
bumbling in his turtle shell clumsily bobbing his turtle head to+and+fro
going on his turtle legs
going slow
snapping at a buzzing fly
snap swallow wink
turning toward a shallow pool
wants a drink
bumbling bobbling stop and go
once I watched a turtle
and now I know there are lots more things to see when you go slow
that's pretty cool
although Daddy probably wouldn't like it that there's a turtle poem on his birthday because he's not a turtle
