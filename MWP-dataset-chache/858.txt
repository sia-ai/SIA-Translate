I wish I could hop like that
I love you all the way down the river
and all the way down the lane as far as the river
cried Little_nut_brown_hare
I love you across the river and over the hills
said Big_nut_brown_hare
that is very far
thought Little_nut_brown_hare
he was almost too sleepy to think any more
then he looked beyond the thornbushes out into the big dark night
nothing could be farther than the sky
I love you right up to the moon he said
and closed his eyes
oh that's far thought Little_nut_brown_hare
that is very very far
Big_nut_brown_hare settled Little_nut_brown_hare into his bed of leaves
he leaned over and kissed him good night
give him a kiss
then he layed down close_by and whispered with a smile
I love you right up to the moon
and back
