Ryan too
we can keep score okay
okay we'll see who can knock down the most
does that sound like fun
alright
that sounds like a good idea
so remember we said that we were gonna have a party
well what's important about today
why did we decide to get Ryan a present
it's your last day of school
the next day
tomorrow is his last day at school right Boo
and then um what about Ryan
why why do we want to give Ryan a present
why would we give Ryan a present
he's leaving
yep I'm leaving too
he's all done with school
so should he open it
do you want to have him see what it is
will you help me open it
I'm really excited
I don't get presents too often
now what is it
oh thank you very much
your welcome
did you pick this out Matty
thank you
we thought you wanted to remember Fredonia
do you wanna read it
you wanna say what it says Matty
yeah what does it say
you don't wanna read it okay
I hope it fits
I don't have a shirt like this either
oh
this is my first Fredonia shirt
is it really
yes it is
well that's a good thing he doesn't have any Fredonia shirts
do you have any Fredonia shirts
do you remember if you have one or not
you actually do have one but it's too small
you had it when you were a Twinklestar
well should we meet this new person
she's really nice
yeah she's somebody new
you know what
since Ryan is moving she's gonna be the one that she's gonna come we're gonna meet her here instead
she doesn't really know anything about what she has to do
what do we do in here usually
yeah
play with what
yep play with toys and
what's she supposed to do
do the tape thing
yep you know what's going on
what do you have there
chocolate bar thing
oh yeah chocolate oh it's a container
I think it's supposed to be chocolate and milk
good you like chocolate milk
I like chocolate milk too
do you like it better than white milk
I do too
and what would you like to do today
what do I want to do
um
you wanna play with this
okay cool I don't think last time that we had these
these are cool
you know what we totally gotta remember to give Ryan something else too
the car yep
should we get it
I was wondering about that
yep
did you have fun playing with it
you didn't
show me how it goes again
this is a pretty neat car
I like this car
yeah but we had it too long
we kept forgetting to bring it
that's okay
so should we buy stuff
you're gonna do this thing okay
well I would like to buy him
okay how much does it cost
I gave you my money that's right
uh oh it's stuck
open open open
what should we do
I don't think you're really supposed to push the money like that
you just lay it down though instead of flat and then you can put the coins in that way
oh I get this money back
and this
cool
you know we just started watching a movie again
what movie did we just rent that we've seen a couple of times
Dinosaur yep
what is that for
oh I think it's to make announcements
like you know how sometimes you don't know how much something costs we would say um how much does the chocolate milk cost and then it would be all around the store and then the person who was by the chocolate milk would be able to go and see how much it costs
what're you gonna say
nothing
I'd like to buy this person too
I have something I need to buy too
so we've been watching Dinosaur and Dinosaur's a very interesting movie
where where are they trying to go in that movie
do you remember
are they just wandering around or where are they headed
you don't remember the name of it
I think they're trying to go to the great watering
the nesting grounds that's right the nesting grounds
how does Aladar get to the nesting grounds
do you remember in the first part how do they get through there
so you think that's where Aladar turned around too
but then they made it right
uh oh what happened to him when he fell off the edge
oh no
yeah that was too bad
but then what happens at the end Aladar and Mira what happens with Aladar and Mira they have a what
well what comes out of the egg at the end
a little Aladar yeah
that's a good movie
um hm
well you weren't able to watch movies for like almost a whole week remember that
do you remember how come you couldn't watch them
yeah so he couldn't watch them for a while so it was exciting that he got_to watch them again
that's good
so how was your day today
we were just talking about that
how was it sitting you know with your friends
oh well that's good
you didn't do anything bad to the kids that's good news
did you do anything bad to the snake
you don't let him out
you got a snake in there
that is news he doesn't know anything about the snake
ah huh
I think he would too
so how do you feed him then
what do you have_to do
ah huh
I don't know how
do you
that's good
does he have_to drink water or anything
we don't know about snakes if they need water or not
so how do you you have_to feed him bugs then
how do you get the bugs
oh okay
that sounds pretty neat
hey you know did you go for a walk yesterday in a wagon maybe
I think I saw you going for a walk
where were you going
to the downtown park
I think so yep and you were sitting in a wagon
yep
so what'd you do at the downtown park
play
well that sounds pretty fun
you guys went somewhere else too because when I got home there was a little pile of fish
you went to the candy store
what'd you get
candy
I like candy
you were telling me something that xxx you got though
oh really
that's surprising because we don't usually litter but it sounds like you couldn't really eat it
so tomorrow is kind of an interesting day because it's Matty's last day of school
so what are we gonna go do tonight we have_to go get some things
for the teachers and Cheryl
and anybody else should we get presents for or do you think that's enough
yeah
you know what Matty
I didn't tell you this this morning but when I was leaving I saw Marissa's mommy and I asked her for their phone number so that I can call her and then we can make plans and then you and Marissa can play together
what do you think we should do with Marissa
you don't know
well would you like her to come over to our house
yeah
what do you think she would think was interesting at our house
you don't know huh
I know one thing I bet she would think is interesting
your tortoise that's pretty neat
you do
well doesn't he run away
no
well what does he do
oh okay
does he like to go back there
does he
that's pretty funny
does he
there's another place he likes to go too though
oh on the heating pad
so sometimes he goes behind that one yep
oh my gosh is that a brush
that is super funny
did you tell Ryan what we're planning to do for your birthday
he might be thinking you were gonna be four and he might be wondering if you're gonna have a birthday party
wow
they will
so are they not they're not in cages then
you just drive around
yep
boy that sounds pretty neat
yeah I don't know
I think they might put like a big fence so they can't come walk in the road but monkeys can go everywhere
and do you remember what else we might have and remember I was saying also might come and lick the top of our car if we took the green car
giraffes
they might think that our green car is a tree
they might
that is funny
okay let's take the red car then
so how come you decided you didn't want to have a birthday party
too many kids
yeah
so who's gonna go to this lion country safari place
yeah
anyone else
daddy that's true
I don't think anyone else
should we bring the cats
what do you think they would think about that place
oh I don't really know
I don't know
is it missing
maybe it's under here I'll have_to see if I can find it
do you know who this one is
I think it's supposed to be George
I don't know why they picked George but I think it's supposed to be George
is this what you're looking for
cool
what does he do with his golden snitch
I have not seen that movie
you never saw Harry Potter
nope it's my summer project
wow so you've seen them all
are there any scary parts that I should know about
does it get him
oh that's good
that is very good news
was it a big snake
you know we were talking about that word the other day I don't remember
oh a is it a xxx something like that
I don't know too much about snakes
do you
not at our own house
at school
but that one is not huge like in Harry Potter
how big is the one at your school
you wanna go over there
that's fine you can go over there
you know what there's another scary part in the second Harry Potter
do you remember what Ron says
can you panic now
what was Ron scared of in the movie
oh
giant spiders yep
how do we do this again Boo
you want to try to set them up in there
alright
you know I had a hard time trying to set them up because they kept falling down all the time
I wonder oops sorry I was thinking if it was on the same level it might work
here we go
what is this for
pinball
it kind of seems like it might be pinball because there's a ball
it's actually called bowling
do you remember when your teacher brought this at school
didn't she bring a little bowling set
I think that happened when you were like a Twinklestar and they brought in bowling
there you go
you're setting them up good
almost done
you know what I don't think Ryan knows what you're gonna do this summer
I'll give him I'll give him a hint okay
it has a ball and you gotta kick the ball so
you're gonna play soccer
that sounds like a lot of fun
I used to play soccer when I was little too
it's very fun
what do you gotta do in soccer
do you know Matty what you're supposed to do in soccer
yeah
you got it
whoa you almost got it
oh that's another way to do it
that works you hit it with another pin
do you want to do it again
what happens after you get them all down
there's that one
do you remember what they call it when you get them all down
oh yeah we still gotta open our boxes
soccer sounds like it's gonna be pretty fun
and ah do you remember who might be on your team who's gonna be on your team
yep Erica
now Ryan probably doesn't know how you know Erica
how do we know Erica
oh you go to the
okay
she's a very nice little girl
well that would be pretty neat
what is that
it's supposed to have a tiny tiny eraser on it
what is this in here
remember we kept finding like lots and lots_of refrigerators and pies
that was kind of funny
I don't think so I think you're right but we have a little sink
oh I like that one
oh look I think I found something
these are the ones that kind of remind me of big doughnuts
I'm not sure what they're supposed to be
you think so huh
okay Matty clean your room
who would that be supposed to be
does he tell you to clean your room
I gotta clean my room too
what would he say
oh no did that break
oh these are kind of I think they're kind of fragile
it looks like it had tape on there I don't really know how this works
I think this is supposed to be grandma and grandpa
these clothes are very old though
look at all those old clothes
this is kind of funny
what do you got on your wrist there
what is that
oh it is
that's pretty neat
so what kinds of things have you and daddy been doing outside since we've seen Ryan like around the house building things
you've been building stuff
well we have something in our backyard now that you lay in
remember that Matty
what did you and daddy put together put up that you can lay in
no it's a hammock we put up
what are you supposed to do in a hammock anyway
lay in it yeah
and you can read
and you can hide all kinds of ideas yeah
and then I'm trying to think of what else you guys have outside now
we have the hammock
daddy's been trying to
you wanna play with the farm now
whoa we got lots and lots_of stuff everywhere
hey come on out
what are they doing in there
how come they don't want to come outside
okay
oh it's raining
you put the farmer in there
I think he's yelling I think he wants to come out
oh_my_goodness everybody's going in there
no no no get off of me please
wouldn't the cows say that Matty
is anybody on top of the cow
okay
there you go
is there anybody upstairs
who's upstairs
who
oh the people
what dog
oh yeah he's up there too I didn't notice him
ruff ruff ruff he says he has to go outside
dog's gotta go out dog's gotta go out though
ruff ruff ruff ruff
now you know I was just reminded of how our cats sometimes bother us in the middle of the night
what do our cats sometimes do
in both sides of their bowl
do you think that's helping
yep
why were they meowing in the middle of the night
right they seemed to be a little more hungry right they would wake up in the middle of the night and get hungry right
yeah and then I say Matty and I go in there and wake you up right go feed the cats
no you don't have_to do it in the middle of the night but you have been feeding them right
that would be nice
that would be very helpful
someone sleeps really hard though I don't know if that would work
no you sleep very hard
remember sometimes I come in and wake you up in the morning and I'm like Matty wake up wake up and you're still sleeping
but you gotta wake up sometimes for school
only how many more days of that though
one
one
just one more day
oh wait wait wait very dangerous
I know somebody who went into one of those chest things
you did
yes
we were playing hide and go seek and you were in there like Momma help help
there was still air but I was still very scared remember
there was some air in there yeah
like ours had air too but I was still scared
what did we make a rule up after that
yeah you can't go in there anymore
oh_my_goodness there's a baby up on your face
we don't really have ours ours is just a chest this one is actually like a little seat
yeah but we don't have that kind of thing do we
hey did you ever find your moss thing at school
remember moss you guys made that thing with the green moss on the plates
oh well that's good
that's good
that was nice they let you make a new one
I wonder if our other one is at home
is that possible that it's at home
that other one
yeah we'll have two now
what are those supposed to be for
they look very interesting
are they hats
you silly one
do you um maybe we could start cleaning up some stuff
yeah I was just gonna say it's starting to get time
yeah
you wanna help me pick these things up real quick
we can put them all back in this box I think
okay I'll clean up these ones and you can clean up those ones
okay well I'll help
where should we put these
here let me get you a bag
what's this for
oh to play Quidditch
are you gonna put these other guys in
what does that mean
well maybe we'll have_to think of one more story to tell Ryan before we go
do you remember something that you like doing with Ryan something that was kind of fun in here that we did with Ryan so that when we meet with her she will remember
what would you say would be good for us to remember and for what we would like to do in here
okay so play with the farm
do you like to play store too
yeah
I'm trying to think well mostly you kind of liked opening those boxes sometimes but now we opened them all right
we might be able to get some new ones though maybe
oh I don't know there's lots_of stuff here
well when somebody's gonna leave college what we would say is we'd say congratulations you finished your college
can you say that
that's a big word congratulations
it is a big word
is that hard to say when you have your mouth full of popcorn
congratulations can you say that
no you're sleeping
oh sorry Ryan he can't say it he's sleeping
I know and we can't wake him up
I saw your eye move very close
I saw it
who am I
I don't know
remember the other day we were playing
we were actually playing kind of a scary game
little pit+vipers
yeah that is yummy
here you go
hey you know what there's a new movie coming out
remember what movie is coming out that we're gonna go see
I'll give you a hint
finding Nemo
do you know what happens in that movie
Nemo goes in the fish tank
and then what
oh yeah
I wonder why he went in the fish tank
that seems pretty silly
did somebody catch him from the ocean and put him in the fish tank
you'll have_to watch the movie huh
I think you're right I think he goes into the fish tank I think that's the story and then they try to find him
I think it would be hard to find him but I bet they do
oh that's rude we don't eat like that
what kind of animal would do that
you don't know
okay let's see
what would I be
that would be like one of our cats
remember how they eat out of the bowl
did you eat snack at school
yeah
you were eating a lot of popcorn
okay well I think it's pretty much gone
Matty we're not leaving just yet cause we're gonna go wash your hands and stuff
we have_to say goodbye to Ryan too
goodbye Matty
okay we'll wipe you off okay
Matthew please wait okay honey
what little thing
oh you know what
I have a little present for you

it's reminding you of the sun I know
alright set it up
what
want to do bowling
okay so what game is this
bowling and what are you supposed to do with bowling
okay and then
and then what are you supposed to do
you throw the ball like this and then
oh my word good job they call that a spare
it only took you two balls to get them all down
yeah you got all of them except that one
hm how you gonna get that
hm thank you very much
you wanna do it
okay you ready
alright so it took three times that time
so we went to the Lion Country Safari
do you remember that
remember what did he do with that guys hat
and then the person brought it back to the man
I dunno they said he was a really sneaky bird
wow almost all of them together
yup now you got them all good job
well the next day after we went to Lion Country Safari was a very special day
what was Monday
it was Monday June ninth
what was special about that day
yeah it was your birthday
what did you do that was cool on your birthday
yes that is funny
Roman and Sophie came over what did you do with them
is that what you and Roman did
you and Roman were kind of wrestling weren't you
do you remember what Roman and Sophie gave you for your birthday
I know you're supposed to use the ball but you use the other pin
what did you get from what did Roman and Sophie give you do you remember
a set of gloppy glops I remember
oh my gosh bare you banging that ball
so we've been doing some other fun things this week
one day we went to the beach do you remember
what happened with you at the beach
oh my gosh you did what in the water
well Leslie may not know but it was actually kind of chilly water
when it was chilly what did you do
you jumped in it like this and didn't you get totally totally wet
yes you did
you were Tonka Joe
you were Tonka Joe with your big ears
I guess so but aren't you supposed to use the ball
so if there's only two more or one more left hit left you're gonna hit it down with one of these
so how many were left
two more
oh no
you shoot it just like that yup
you want to do bowling again
you want to do that again okay
you know another thing that we did that was fun Matty remember when you and I went to the park on Saturday when Daddy was doing the carwash
you and I went to that big big wooden park and what was the game you were playing there
do you remember
about something you were looking for
you were looking for your mother
so what did you have_to do to try and find your mother
do you remember
everywhere yup
hey where's the pins
you're pretending they're this way okay
oh great job you hit them all down
oh_my_goodness
wow that was a wild one
oh man it's almost like you split them apart
yes you separated them that's true
I'll have_to use one of these though in order to set them all up again
but wait
what could happen to you
what could happen to you if you're standing on the couch
fall down it could happen
careful
oh_my_goodness did that work
oh no what are you gonna do this time
there's four left
now you separated those again
you want to knock it down with that one
that one doesn't get put up
can you hand me those two Matty

oh no already they are falling
I wonder where it is
is it in your hand
there is actually only one two three four there's only supposed to be ten
these two are never filled up these are empty
there's only supposed to be ten
so this one you have in your hand goes actually right here
but I'm scared
oh no
you did smash them
oh_my_goodness
I see
you know I don't know if Leslie knows about what we did yesterday when we went for a little trip to your school
that's not okay that's rude
I need to take this now

alright go ahead
so who did we go visit at your school yesterday
do you remember
who did we see there

you want to be able to play this again
are you going to keep this pin where it should be
okay I'll let you play again
let's set them up again
so talk about when you went to school yesterday
who did you see
that you were super excited that you missed a lot
Marissa so what's gonna happen with Marissa at the end of the summer

I could of guessed that
you can get them alright away
oh wow you almost went flying yourself
now I don't really understand the game that you were playing with Danny today
so tell me how you play the game
I don't remember hearing that part of the game
oh that's great
oh there was leaping
there was a leap
now I remember something that you guys sounded like you were playing a cowboy game is that right
okay what are you supposed to do in this cowboy game
what is that supposed to do
scratch scratch scratch
wait no no
ow too late
well I didn't know I was supposed to try to catch them
I did really catch them
I was thinking too of something that you got as a gift since we saw Leslie last
do you remember what was the special thing you got that you like to hold now
a snail yeah you like your snails
what was the toy though that you got that you've been taking care of
he's blue
what's the blue toy that you hold
and we were playing yesterday that it was our baby remember
you got a Care Bear
talk about how you had to change the name of the bear
it was really called Grumpy Bear
how come you changed it to Shining Bear
a nicer name
I think so too
oh_my_goodness
I almost caught some yes but I didn't it's true
I almost caught it
I was trying to catch it
so yup you got a Care Bear what else did you get for your birthday
along with the Care Bear came a little movie
do you remember what the movie's about
a video
what were you gonna say about it
oh a magical movie yes that's true
how do we know that it couldn't happen for real
they were on clouds right
that's pretty magical
I know you hit them all over
so yes you got a Care Bear for your birthday
and a Care Bear video
and um Spider Man movie
she might be scared about Spider Man
what should be a part that she shouldn't watch
what's the Green Goblin do
that's the part that's like in the middle of the movie
he makes people into bones
there's a party part and then the people turn into bones
I kind of remember that
remember anything else the Green Goblin does
who does he fight
Spider Man usually yeah
who usually wins
there's a funny part of Spider Man that you've been doing around the house
where you go like this go web right
right what does he try to do
what is he trying to do
make his web come out
and then what happens
whoa that was an interesting one
so it wasn't only that you were using your legs too
with your legs
what could happen maybe
if you're just trying to just kick it
you might kick me or Leslie
that's what I thought
and everything was okay right
that's another thing that could happen
yeah
I was just remembering about another show we were watching
what's that Weezy say
what do we think about that
I think it's dumb
we both think it's dumb

let me look at you through this
I dunno Spider Man

I don't remember playing it that way
you remember

wow she definitely didn't see that edge there you go
so now what's gonna happen
oh no
she doesn't but it's too late
she's already over the edge
she didn't really fall out
did they get injured or are they fine
she's not
do remember one time that Mommy and Daddy got in a car accident
what happened with Mommy and Daddy
fell off the road
what happened with you
how do you know
where were you
in my tummy and you remember that
if you bang it on the floor it might break so don't push it all the way
it still catches down there yeah
oh no
oh_my_goodness

wait a minute
what'd you put in there
that did not look like a quarter
what did you put in there
hey there's a baby in there
it's still a quarter or is it a baby
okay
what if I hear something crying in the cash register
whaa whaa
you know your cash register is crying can you hear it
I did not know that money could cry
look it let me take care of the baby
oh_my_goodness I don't think that's a good home for that baby
a baby can get cold in there
bye bye baby
are you sure
hey Matty I have a question
who's actually driving that car
uh oh oh_my_goodness
that's so funny Boo
so who's fighting over the baby
and who else
oh
she wants her baby back she doesn't want her in the cash register
did you kidnap that baby
did you kidnap the baby
the mommy gave her to you
did she know you were going to put her in the cash register though
hey Boo did you know that we are going to go out with James
what would you like to do with James
really
you don't wanna go anywhere
where would you like to go
I'll just choose a place then
well then tell me
tell me out loud so it can be on the tape go ahead
the candy store with James
that wouldn't take very long
what kind of thing would you tell James is good from the candy store
come on up here please
okay so my question was what would you tell James would be good from the candy store
that would be good to eat from the candy store
a lot of candy
I really think that we should go to the bathroom
do you have_to go
okay
let me see the web is sticky
oh my gosh it's totally sticky
it's weird
ew it's totally sticky
so who should stick in there
the Green Goblin
wow what do you think we could do with this
what are you doing with it
oh that's cool
going around the web
that's cool
do you wanna talk about why we were almost late
we went hiking with Danny and what happened
you were walking slowly
just a little bit you got tired
we walked all the way down to the creek right
and then we had to come back and it was uphill all the way back
it was hard
but didn't you do most of it
this is sticky
you should also talk about what you did yesterday
was it yesterday
maybe even bigger than our house
so what did you do at the waterfall
we didn't play on it
yeah he did he jumped off the edge into the waterfall
but what did you and Roman do
you were looking for fishies
and then
fishies you were looking for fishies
oh fishies mean babies
so you were looking for them and then what happened
we kept them
you let them free
how many did you catch
so Roman got two and you got one right
and then what did that one guy give you guys that was interesting
you don't know
you forget what it is called
a big crayfish
but it was fun
what did you do when you caught them
you saw a crawfish that was laying under a rock
I don't know if I knew that
did it look the same as the one the guy gave you yesterday
it might have been the same same one
could be
you know another thing that's been going on since we met Leslie last time was that you have started a knew thing at night a couple days
what do you do at night on Monday and Wednesday night
soccer right
I'm not sure Leslie knows that much about soccer
they really didn't have soccer when we were kids
so how what are you guys supposed to do in soccer
you kick the ball just anywhere
where are you supposed to kick the ball
into the net yup
so how do you help your team
you kick the ball around to the team
squish webs
does that feel squishy in your hands
so you've been playing soccer a couple nights a week
it's like a toy so it's squished
it is really feeling squishy
