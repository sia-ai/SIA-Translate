yeah but you're kinda finished I think
I think you're finished
how was your weekend
it was it was good
I had a nice weekend
didn't do anything all that exciting
just visit the library
that's exciting
I had a quiet
Mommy's microphone
play xxx
okay ooh clunk
ooh clunk
okay
there you are
there you are
okay
it's xxx xxx xxx today is June twenty June twenty fifth
everybody's on
that's making a good noise
and I'm gonna test the microphone by clicking the
c_d player controls
could hear those very well if this is working
Naima
hm see how do I test hers
do you wanna put on the c_d player
can you put it on
no
okay
let's see we gotta give her xxx
play baby
Mommy will play with you I just wanna get you some crunchy food
can you come here for a second
oh that's a bowl
would you like a crunchy piece of wheat
no
shoulda heard that xxx pretty loud if hers is working
mm okay
xxx xxx xxx mm
boy that's stale
yuck
mm okay
okay
I am testing f one
if it's working
you should be able to hear this very clearly
that was the c_d player controls
okay I'm gonna shut f one off
no I'm not I'm gonna leave it on
xxx xxx turn on f two
this is a test of the transmitter that I believe was not working
I'm close
I can't play right now because I'm figuring out this equipment
you've got a nice cup though
so I'm
bledder bledder is right
so I've got it on f one
I'll try it on f two later
on the receiver of f one and f two are on
but there is no
I do not have the transmitter for f two on
and I'm close to the camera now so I'm gonna walk outside and if you can hear me then
this transmitter is working
cause I'm gonna be talking constantly and now I'm in the breeze way and now we're looking outside
right here
well and you definitely would not hear me without the microphone here
so this transmitter itself is not the problem
if this sound is working
okay now we're gonna go back
and replay that
okay the only difference with this test is that
on the receiver from the last session you just heard was that on the receiver
the f two switch is on off
rather than on on
and the other transmitter is still also off so
you shouldn't be able to hear me
if I
if you can hear me now then then what then it makes no difference whether the other transmitter is turned off on the receiver
look there's xxx
hi xxx
hi
xxx you gonna open the door for her
good job
thank you
how are you today
xxx xxx you
okay thanks
okay this is a test of
the transmitter which is on f one right now
and you definitely should not be able to hear this if there's a problem
now this should be fine cause I just tested it
xxx this is the one that I thought was not working because it had a new battery
but I did just change the battery so it has a second new battery which may have been the problem
and if you can hear this it's definitely fine
kay now I'm coming back to the camera
I was in the other room
and xxx now I xxx put on the one that's on f two
and walk into the other room
what is
xxx and jiggling the camera seems to be there
if I jiggle the camera a little
the green lights are on
okay
the green lights are now on the receiver
they were kind of jiggling
um off and on to red
which is bizarre in and of itself
it may be a separate problem
and now with this transmitter on f two
I'm going to walk away
and if you can't hear this
at the same volume right now then
receiver is not functioning properly
right
okay stop
okay a double test of the hypothesis that the f two channel on the receiver is the malfunction
I've just switched transmitters
the one I have I'm putting onto f two
both green lights on the receiver are on
they're on green
and I'm walking into the other room speaking at the same tone of voice
and you shouldn't be able you should be able to
sounds like I'm getting louder and louder now then the hypothesis is correct
okay
