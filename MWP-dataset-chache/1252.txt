Good Job Little Bear is here

I think that Oil Spill is the one I was thinking of
it's about an oil spill
do you wanna sit in the bed and read that together
okay
mhm
well there's a certain kind of oil spill that happens when oil being carried lots a big amount of oil being carried by a boat uh has an accident and spills out accidentally
and that causes problems for animals when that happens
oh and we haven't read that called Snowy Owl
is that a beaver or an otter
oh I wanna read this and find out
mm that's a problem
poor little otter
well we're gonna read about that
right now
xxx into the bed and do some reading unless you wanna read in the rocking chair
so many good books
Naima I'll be right back
I just wanna get these things out of the way
well oil spills aren't good for animals
all kinds of problems
no
people can't be swimming in the water when there's an oil spill
you'd get sick from that
cause it's not good to swim where there's
you know that's not like the oil we cook with
that's oil that is used to put into cars and gasoline
crude oil it turns into that kind of oil
come sit here next to me
get comfy
have a seat
well it lives there
but let's find out what it where it lives and what it's doing and what happens to it
this is called Oil Spill
I'm not even sure what kind of animal that is
yeah I guess I think it's an otter
mm oil spills happen when big big big boats like this that are carrying crude it's called crude oil from one country to another have an accident of some kind and they spill their oil into the ocean
that doesn't happen very often but when it happens it's not a good thing
okay and this is actually the story of an oil spill that really happened a while ago
the night of March twenty fourth nineteen eighty nine was dark and cold
this is how big that boat is
a huge black oil tanker glided out of the port of Valdez Alaska
painted on its bow was its name Exxon_Valdez
the bow of the boat is this part kind_of like the front
the Exxon_Valdez floated low in the water
about fifty million gallons of crude oil weighed it down
the huge tanker slowly sailed out into Prince William Sound
and then suddenly it happened
crunch
the ship slammed into an underwater reef
thick black oil flowed out of the Exxon Valdez's smashed tanks
it poured into the dark water
the Exxon_Valdez spilled out out eleven million gallons of oil
that much oil could fill over a thousand big swimming pools
this is a picture of Alaska Naima
this is a map of Alaska right here
this is where that oil spill happened this part of Alaska
are you cold
you're uncomfortable
the sticky oil soon covered eleven thousand square miles of ocean water
okay let's skip ahead and see
oil stuck to the feathers of many ducks geese and sea birds
the birds couldn't swim or fly
some of them died
oil got into the bodies of fish shrimp and crabs
no one knows how many of them were killed
mm the oil is hurting the animals
sea otters sea+lions harbor seals and killer whales swallowed oil
that's a whale
they breathed the poisonous fumes
these animals got very sick also
hey that's a sea+lion I think
do you remember we saw sea lions
yeah
because it spilled out of the boat
oil spills have many causes
some are accidents
like a tanker like the Exxon_Valdez runs aground or collides with another ship
that means bumps into another ship
workers can make mistakes
or an undersea oil well starts to leak leak
or a pipe can break
the oil spreads out
it floats on top of the water
experts on oil spills rush to the scene
they start to clean up the mess
the first job is to stop the oil from spreading
they put a boom around the spill
the boom is like a collar
it keeps the oil in one place
you see this red thing here
this is the boom
it's usually made out of different things
for small spills the experts may call for a skimmer
there are several kinds of skimmers
one type works like a giant vacuum+cleaner
it sucks up the oil from the water
sometimes the oil the skimmer collects can be used again
for some small spills experts place special pads on top of the oil
the pads are like sponges
they soak up the oil then they have_to get rid of the soaked up oil
for larger spills the experts may set the oil on fire
clean up crews also use chemicals to get rid of large oil spills
other chemicals make the oil come together
the oil forms a layer like a sheet of rubber
one type of skimmer I guess this is the skimmer machine lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris that means garbage out of the water
oh what kind of animals are these
puffins
sometimes the experts decide that no action is the best way to treat an oil spill
the wind and waves mix the oil and water together
it is like mixing oil and vinegar to make salad dressing
in time much of the oil disappears
oil spills are major disasters
it's a very bad thing that happens that's what a disaster is
slowly scientists are learning how to clean them up
they are learning how to prevent spills
how can we help to prevent oil spills
that's a good question
well we can use less oil
if we use less oil there will be fewer oil tankers in the oceans
then the chance of oil spills will not be as great
one way
I bet you didn't know this Naima
you might be surprised
one way to save oil is to use less electricity
did you know that oil and electricity are related
electricity is often produced by burning oil
less electricity means less oil and less risk of an oil spill
because sometimes power plants burn oil to make electricity that comes through the electric lines into our house
another way to cut oil needs is to use less gasoline which is made from oil
gasoline is made from oil
that means driving smaller cars and staying within the speed limit
hm
oh there's a child who wrote a letter to someone in the government
and drew pictures of sea animals
wow and look at the other books in this series
let's see this is a stage two book
this book is called Be A Friend to Trees
this book is called Dinosaurs Are Different
this book is called Where Does the Garbage Go
that would be a good book to get
that's called The Planets in Our Solar System
hm
trees are good for the earth and good for people and good for animals
so you need to be good to trees
mm that's someone who's helping to clean up an oil spill showing what the oil looks like
that's a different kind of oil
oh
oh
okay
that's a really hard job
oh thank_you

well any kind of oil that's not an edible oil is bad to eat
what kind of oil is okay to eat Naima
when I cook something on the stove what do I sometimes fry it in
yeah olive oil right
you dip your bread in olive oil
in a restaurant sometimes and even at home
and peanut oil
crude oil
oh you mean are there any other kinds of oil
mm well anything that's made out of crude oil like uh the kind of oil that goes in a car both the gasoline and the other kind of oil that a car needs
remember when my car was leaking oil
that wasn't gasoline but it was a kind of
it's called motor oil
motor oil xxx that's bad for people to eat
uh mineral oil is not good to eat
mineral oil
he did try to fix my car

next to the ocean
okay cats don't like water do they
oh is there gonna be any other animal
okay Motorcycle_Chicken will be in the water

okay
okay
okay

what's that black stuff
it's an oil spill
it's an oil spill and I see a duck in the water
uhoh
I better call the oil spill experts
hello xxx hello
is this the environmental police
well I'm calling to report an oil spill in xxx in Johnson Bay
we're in xxx and this is Johnson Bay and we see oil in the ocean
can you please send out a team to clean it up
there's at least one duck and there could be others that I can't see from my window
thank you
oh good
mm
I hope you have gloves on to clean up the oil
oh look look Kitty Cat xxx look at the workers who are that team cleaning up that oil spill
I think it's gonna take them a couple of weeks to finish that job
mm maybe we should offer those workers a cup of of coffee or tea so they can have their break
hello mam
would you like to come in and have a break from that hard work
come into our house for a minute
have a seat
have a seat
would you like tea or coffee
what kind of tea would you like
herbal tea
I'm gonna go fix it
my daughter would like to talk to you for a while
while I make the tea and then I'm gonna come back with it
oh
please don't drag that Naima like that
mam please go ahead and sit in our living+room area
I brought some tea and a snack for you and we can talk about this oil spill that happened
sit down sit down
okay here is your herbal tea
mam you can hold it with your hands can't you
hold that
and here's a snack
I thought you might like some corn+on+the+cob with that
you must be hungry after all that cleaning up oil
oh so so what was it like out there cleaning up the oil
oh no
did you rescue that chicken
hm
it was breathing the fumes
oh
will will will there be a veterinarian who knows how to take care of chickens who have problems with oil spills
oh what kind of texture was that oil
oh
huh
must be hard to get clean at the end of the day for you
if you're handling that
oh did it smell bad too
oh
hm
well
and do you think that
how is the veterinarian going to get the oil off the feathers
it's pretty sticky isn't it
that won't hurt them
uhhuh
and it'll take the oil off
oh that's good
I'm sure that chicken will need to rest in the veterinary hospital for a while
before it's returned
leave that alone okay
okay and what am I doing
okay
oh I'm gonna be the
yeah you can
I can't play if you don't clip it
please clip it let's play
how about if I clip it to the bear
xxx you have_to
that means you have_to keep them still though
okay keep him
well while you're in the while you're in the wagon just keep him right where he is okay
okay
aw he's all snuggly
but what's important is
in fact I'm gonna see if we
I think you could clip it to Naima's shirt that would be fine
it's okay like this
it's okay like this
xxx but the important thing is not to touch that too much
or not to touch it at all actually
because that would mean we'd just hear fuzz when we play it back we don't wanna hear fuzz we want to hear what you were saying right
this is the microphone if you touch it it's gonna give a fuzz sound which won't be good
no
so who's the customer am I gonna be a customer
oh yeah
yeah
Naima has a slight cold
Naima's voice
I noticed that
Naima's voice is not quite what it usually is
what does this go to
oh right okay
Naima is in her wagon
okay I'm the store owner
where is it
it's over there
there's a book mess on the floor
I don't think you can use the wagon when there's a book mess can you
mm
really
which way
which way
I didn't see which way you were pointing
this way
that way
that+away that+away
this way that+away
oh clunk xxx
I don't think we're gonna have a blizzard like that in a long time Naima
that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years
it's a lotta years yep
twelve is a lotta years too
yeah
yep
there was a very bad blizzard almost this bad seventeen years ago
that's a long time ago too isn't it
I guess Daddy will wear his microphone
although it's actually Naima's
a voice we really wanna have on our recording
I wish Naima would wear the microphone on her shirt so we would have a very good recording
if she stays where she is right now it'll be fine
if you wore the microphone on your shirt we would have a very good recording
oh I know that's what Mommy says
but I think if you really wanted a really good recording you would wear it on your shirt
if you wanted it
that way we
I'm gotta open up my store
hope I get a lotta money and a lotta buyers today
okay
okay
okay
okay and what are we doing now
are we going to the grocery store
okay
I'm I'm videotaping people at my store
oh some stores do that did you realize that
some stores do that to protect themselves from robbers
well sometimes robbers go into stores when they wanna steal things and not pay money
well because if it's recorded on the video then we have a picture of who the robber was and then the police can go find them later
so that tells them they really shouldn't do that because they'll get caught very easily
well because if they know that there's pictures being taken of them then then they'll know that police can find them
yeah that's the idea
so shall we go to the store
okay
so you're not gonna be Miss Chaos in this one are you
oh you're Miss Chaos the sister okay
