Simba told did as he was told unaware that his uncle's hyena friends had been ordered to finish him off
Scar returned to Pride rock to take over the throne
meanwhile Simba plodded across the Savanna without any food or water
it wasn't long before he fainted under the hot hot sun
as the vultures circled overhead a big hearted wart+hog named Pumbaa stumbled upon the lion
he turned to his trusty pal a fast talking meerkat named Timon
he's so cute and all alone can we keep him
Pumbaa are you nuts lions eat guys like us
but Pumbaa scooped Simba him up anyway and carried him to safety
when Simba awoke the first thing that sprang to his mind was his father
Timon taught him about hakuna matata which means no responsibilities and no worries
you've got_to put your past behind you he said and that's exactly what Simba did
he stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long long time and grew into a very big lion
but eventually he got homesick
and one night he looked at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him a long time ago
the next day Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness
who is that
who's that
it's Nala
Nala what are you doing here
why didn't you come back to Pride rock you're the king she said
I'm not the king Scar is
Simba he let the hyenas take over the Pride lands there's no food or water and if you don't come back soon everyone will be in trouble you're our only hope
I can't go back
Simba yelled at the heavens you said you'd always be there for me but you're not
because of me
Simba didn't believe he could challenge Scar to the throne so he stayed in the jungle with Nala and his new friends
but I knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the circle of life and I headed for the jungle
when Simba saw me he was surprised
who are you
question is I asked who are you
I thought I knew but now I'm not so sure
well I know who you are you're Mufasa's boy
I led Simba to a reflecting pool
when he looked in the water he saw a lion
that's not my father it's just my reflection
look harder he lives in you I said
the ghost of Mufasa magically appeared
look inside yourself Simba you are more than what you have become
you must take your place in the Circle of life
that's the ghost of his father of king Mufasa
yeah well scary but he's still nice
he looks a little scary but he's still very nice
yeah
when Simba arrived back at Pride rock he found the land bare and dry
the hyenas were in control and Scar was shouting at Simba's mother
suddenly a flash of lightning revealed the edge of Pride rock and there stood Simba
Scar jumped back
Simba I'm a little surprised to see you alive
give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart said Simba
Scar started to slink off but he turned and lunged one last time at Simba
Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily
limping badly Simba climbed to the top of Pride rock
he let out a magnificent roar as he looked over his kingdom
before long Pride rock flourished again
Nala remained by Simba's side and soon they had their own newborn cub
with their friends around including Zazu Pumbaa and Timon a new celebration of life took place
after making a mark on the forehead of the young cub I held him up for all the kingdom to see

wow
sure Sweetie
it happened one winter morning on Plum Street
the moon was still up making moon beams and shadows on Plum Street
in the little white house Mrs Bear and Sam were baking
cakes
they stirred with big spoons swirling and tasting batter
they peaked in the oven at two rows of cakes
golden brown cakes for their friends on Plum Street
come on cakes whispered Sam I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait
Mrs Bear and Sam waited for cakes
now can we go Mama now
soon said Mrs Bear soon Sam
xxx that's right the egg cracked it was a little bit of a mess
do you think we should make something later
we should bake something
what would be a good thing for us to bake
cherries wow
those look yummy
they waited and waited and then at last Mrs Bear sniffed the air with her nose in the air and said I believe our cakes are ready
Mrs Bear and Sam counted cakes and there were twelve
they tucked them in bags and there were twelve red bags
look they're wrapping them up and putting the cakes into the bags
yes
that's right it's the blue paper that they're wrapping the cakes in
outside snow tumbled on houses and sprinkled the trees
it powdered the yard and Mrs Bear's truck
Mrs Bear and Sam climbed up in the truck that was green
that's right he's sitting in the truck with his mommy right
which seat
I guess he's sitting in a special car seat huh
yep
they bumped along in the early light just the two of them on Plum Street
uphill and down up and down to the very end of Plum Street
our friends will love my cakes Sam told his mama
of course Mrs Bear said
Mrs Bear pulled up close to the first sleepy house
here we are Sam I'll wait here and you take the cake
all by myself whispered Sam
go go go Mrs Bear put her arm around Sam
you can do it Sam
and off he went all by himself in new snow
all by himself waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
all by himself taking cake to their friends
Sam left the red bag at the door
the sign on the bag said
a tasty surprise
then he ran back to the truck where his mama was waiting
I did it said Sam
of course said Mrs Bear
Mrs Bear and Sam bumped along just the two of them uphill and down up and down
at each sleepy house Mrs Bear stopped the truck
she put her arm around Sam
here I go whispered Sam
go go go Mrs Bear said
and off he went making tracks in new snow
waving a red bag and waving to Mrs Bear
leaving one tasty cake at each sleepy door all by himself
that's right there were two cakes left in two red bags
that's right
for us whispered Sam
of course said Mrs Bear
the sun was just sunning up the little white house
hello house said Sam as they went inside kicking off their boots
Mrs Bear poured cocoa in cups and they wriggled their toes in fat socks enjoying their cakes with cocoa
and as their bellies filled up they took turns telling stories
stories about a bear called Sam who takes cakes to his friends
and they love his cakes so much
