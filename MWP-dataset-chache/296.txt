uhoh

oh yeah what am I gonna show you
what am I gonna show you
oh Mommy's gonna show those to me
and what are you gonna do
well it looks like you're showing your blocks to Jessica
I guess there's more ambient noise here isn't there
a big thing
what's a thing
what thing are you making
it's gonna look like somebody
are you gonna make a bridge or a tower
did you say a tower very softly
a thing
okay
hm
I think Jessica's gonna go and get something yeah
it's an island really
oh cool
and let's tear it off at the bottom
that's that puzzle we made remember
all right let's see where are your your markers are over here
are you ready
oh do you wanna paint again instead of using markers
do you think you could paint a flying head
okay
let me get the let me get the ah water out for your water colors then
all right and you can paint a flying head for Jessica
we we
it's it's the
where'd they go
let me get some fresh water here
those are the paints
oh
where did you get those
huh
you don't remember
was it a present
oh
a what
box
are you gonna paint the what it looks like the paint box
wow
you want some more paint it's hard to see isn't it
that was a splash isn't it
that's where the the paint and the water splash back at the paintbrush
that's a spider there
well those is that one of the eyes right there
yeah mm hm yep
are you painting white there
yeah
oh did he walk away
are you still looking for the spider
I think he went to his hose house
those the big eyes right
that's the microphone that's the green light that says the microphone is on isn't it
the red light that says the battery is low if the red light's on
but the red light isn't on so that means the battery is doing really well
yeah that's on
let's see
sure let's paint the microphone
okay let's see
if it if it's kinda this rectangle like this isn't it
so should we paint a little green light
put a little green circle
it's on right
and then a red one
should we use this brush for the red one
that is your brush but I thought I'd just borrow it for the red for a minute since it was all cleaned off
up onto my sweater
it's black
should we paint should we use the black paint then
okay
do you wanna do it or do you want me to do it
okay
no it's not a brack bush but I it will look black because we're gonna use the black paint won't it
I wonder what he would talk about if he could talk
a microphone for you
should we give the flying head some really black eyes here
right here
oh yeah sharp teeth okay
now is that an eyebrow what is that you're painting
sharp teeth wow does he have two mouths
or is that just the top teeth and the bottom teeth there
okay
all right are we gonna do another microphone for Emma
okay
should we paint Emma first should we paint you first
okay
what color Emma should we make
orange how about an orange Emma
no
are you orange
you're kind of orange aren't you
I mean you're you're more orange than any any other of these colors I think
there's that little Emma right because you're very much littler than the flying head
well you you are big but you're you're big compared to the spider but compared to this flying you're littler than the flying head aren't you
no
how big
how big are you
you're pretty big
are you as big as a car
I don't know where the spider went honey
I thought he just kinda dried up
what do you want
he ran away
you want another microphone for Emma
let's paint Emma's microphone
all right well we have Emma now which is good
let's do the microphone for Emma
green and red
all right let's do the red light first
well it is kind of a rectangle isn't it
all right here's Emma's microphone over here
a rectangle with a red light
no we're missing that piece of the puzzle
you ready for your green light
okay
here's your green light
there you go
well I put the red light here though right
red light green light
now do we need a cord for you
all right let's draw your cord
should we make a black cord or what color cord should we make
a black cord
we don't wanna knock your water over
oh do you think it's gonna stick there
I'm gonna make your cord now
look at this long cord we could clip it right here
oh it didn't stick
it didn't stick did it it fell off
it's funny how the the paint sticks to the paper but the puzzle doesn't stick to the easel does it
perfect
whoa
well it will look good there
that red puzzle piece on the red button
you know what I think you'd need glue for that wouldn't you
glue is makes things stick but paint doesn't
well you know what
you couldn't use it like a puzzle anymore
you wanna glue the puzzle together or can you just put it back where put it back in the in the little rectangle
I bet one of these pieces fits better than the other ones
all right what should we make
is that a car
what's this one
mm hm
and this is
bus mm hm
and what's that one there
train and then
airplane okay
and you have a new bicycle don't you
remember this thing about you needing to wear a helmet when you're on the bicycle
why do we need to why do we need to ride wear a helmet
what might happen if we don't wear a helmet
something about this thing here this head
you know well you know that mommy and daddy wear a helmet when we ride our bikes all the time
