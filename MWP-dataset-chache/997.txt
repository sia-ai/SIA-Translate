I'll sit right over here right over here until you fall asleep
I promise
that's right
Mommy's going to sit in here with you until the airplane goes away
I know you don't honey and that's why Mommy's going to sit in here until the airplane goes away
I think it's probably taking Betty home from Chicago okay

today is a special time
Mommy will do that
okay you rest

okay so fine okay
okay I'm going to sit right here I'm just going to sit right here until you go to sleep okay
I think it went away honey
honey Mommy knows you were a little disturbed by the airplane so Mommy's going to sit in here for a while
you just relax and put your head down and try to go to sleep and Mommy will Mommy will rest over here on this other bed okay
okay
good
you know what hon
Mommy's going to go out now because it's nice and quiet and it's time for a nap
now you can have
would you like to have one of your friends on your bed
and read a book in your bed
alright that will be okay
what do you you want Thumbelina
no honey Mommy's going to go out but you can have your book in here
and then you take your nap when you need it
what's the matter pookiepie
did Mommy say you could have a book in bed here
did it drop down
you know what I think
I think Daddy's going to rock you okay
because you got kind of distracted with the noise didn't you
let me rock you a little bit
and let me explain hon what's the story
when you when you went to bed before you went to sleep an airplane went over and you got a little upset at the noise didn't you
but the airplane noises are fine noises that means that somebody was going to um some fun place in an airplane
maybe they were going to London
hey
that might be that's a very good thought
it could be Annie coming back to Tanta's
why I bet that could be
oh Annie's going to be really happy to see Tanta too you know
hey that's fun
I never thought of that but I think you're right
well anyway you got a little frightened of the noise and Mommy came in and said you could read a book for a while and then you finished the book and now it will be time to go to sleep
when you wake up
when you wake up we're going to do the following we're going to go outside and Mommy's going to plant lettuce in the garden
and you can help Mommy plant the lettuce that we bought at the store this morning
and then if you want to we can go to the park and go s go on the swings in the park
or we can maybe see if Andy and David are outside and we can play with Andy and David on their bikes
and then tonight we're going to go for a pizza
with Stephen in the pizza bassinet and we're going to call up Carl and see if Carl wants to come
oh well I think Caitlyn has something else to do so we can't call up Caitlyn but we're gonna try Carl and see if Carl wants to go
we don't know but even if Carl doesn't go we'll go
yeah
so that's going to be a very fun afternoon and evening
now but you need to be rested in order to do that so you have to take a nap nap now and then when you get up
we'll do all those fun things
let me draw this drape a little bit better
and then we'll rock you for two more minutes and then I'll go out and you have nap and when you wake up we'll do all those fun things
I'm rocking you just a little bit then you take a nap then we'll do a lot of fun things
when you get up but if you don't have nap then we can't do them because you'll be too tired
okay good nap nap pookie I love you

night night hon
I love you
what is it hon
this is Daddy right here
what is it Pookey pie
do you want Daddy to rock you and tell you about tomorrow
okay
you lie there and Daddy'll rock you and tell you about tomorrow
tomorrow I think is Carl's birthday
so the big thing that's going to happen tomorrow is that after we get up and say good morning Mommy and good morning Daddy then he goes and gets your juice
and then we'll play around here some and then we'll have our cheese omelette and our cereal
and then we're going to Carl's with a present
we're going to bring a birthday present for Carl
now I betcha he opens it it's going to be a truck that we're going to give him
and you're not supposed to tell Carl what it is until he opens it so he can be surprised
and then you'll play at Tanta's and I think tomorrow Mormor will probably pick you up
and play with you outside and it'll be a nice day we hope and we'll play with you outside
and then you'll have dinner
and we'll have a lot of fun times but right now we have to go to sleep because it's nighttime
so you have a good night's sleep Pookey and I'll see
Stephen's crying he's going to go to sleep right now

I don't hear but you know what
Mommy thinks I might plant my string beans because Tanta planted hers
it's surely warm enough tonight to plant string beans
