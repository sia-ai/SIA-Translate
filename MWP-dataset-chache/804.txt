I just wonder if they'll let you do that
oh they have them there
you can rent them
five dollars a week or something like that
okay
very inexpensive inexpensive
those things you have they keep jumping around
that's because we don't have any aerial
the aerial fell off the roof and we didn't have it put on again
we don't want to buy we don't want to buy a color television because Nathaniel stands so close to it to watch it and xxx
but I think we ought_to get one with a good picture because it's for him it's tough enough to see the world that badly and then to see it double with a shadow and then zig_zag in it
Nathaniel's one of the most concentrated eaters
puts his whole self into it doesn't he
he chews on one bite and stares at the next
very thorough
we were we were going to rent him out for awhile
every time we go visit kids p people with kids around his age who are who don't eat very much
boy after about three days they're sitting at the table like this shoveling it in shoveling it in
really
adjusting this all to the role model
what's coming out now
your toes oh oh we'll loosen this guy up too and we'll give your toes room to breathe in there
there isn't that better
yeah the heel is up by your b
and your toes are getting bent under
there spread them out now spread them out and wiggle them around
there that's better
there there there you are there you go
they're all loose and nice
wiggle them
you can wiggle them
you can wiggle them
that's waving them honey
that's not wiggling them
wiggling means going like this
yeah
can you do that with your toes
sure you can
no no honey just one foot still
hold your foot still and just move your toes
just move your toes up and down and around
up and down
down and around and around
Isabelle is into something called reflexology
somebody she met in when she and another friend of ours went to Florida together
a woman works on the feet
the connections of the toes and this is called reflexology
so Isabelle bought the book
and it is good
it does limber you up and make you feel good
your toes bent forward and backwards and sideways and under

what kind of an airplane did you go in
an upstairs airplane
an old+fashioned upstairs airplane
that's the kind you flew in
or that's the kind we saw in the museum
airplanes what
airplanes go on floors no
well because floors are inside buildings
and airplanes go outside
they go on runways
for a little ways
in order until they take off
and then they go in the sky
they're too big to go in buildings
mostly except for hangars
but they go on runways
and they go in the sky
but they but they're not too big to go in special airplane buildings like the air and space museum
where we saw lots_of airplanes
the what
museum
we saw the airplane museum
in Washington
airplane museum is in Washington
where we saw the airplanes hanging up in the inside the building
and we saw helicopters that's right
that's right
that's exactly right
and we saw movies of airplanes
remember
we saw it in the museum
well because that was what they were showing
remember we went to the other museum
remember the round museum
with all the little with all the little sculptures in it
you liked you liked that one even better
and the big pictures
on the walls

uh he he liked the other one much better
it's all_gone
you want you want your bread and butter or do you are you finished
