Charles was as happy as he cold be
but he liked to play alone
he wouldn't talk to Wanda Sue and he never went near the phone
it's a new day said Charles' mother let's go in the store and say hello

his mother told him say goodbye Charles hid in a flour sack

someday when he's big he'll kiss me back
I'm so embarrassed said Charles' mother you never say goodbye or thank you

like butter you'll melt the defensive line

Charles trembled like an autumn leaf hi roared the coach my name is Fred
he doesn't look so well to me take him home and put him to bed
who likes football

and what team does daddy like

Charles said his dad you're a jelly roll you're just a cowardly custard
you're like a sandwich without the bread not to mention the ham and mustard
how will you ever go to school or find a job or get married
Charles sat down and cried so hard
yeah he had to be carried
and Charles' father murmured low a babysitter's coming tonight you know the one it's Mrs Block and everything will be alright
