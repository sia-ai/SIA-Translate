November's older than you think Edna
Abe let me put the scissors up okay
you don't like me
how come
when you go to school Abe

thanks Ann
what picture
Abe would you like some raisins
they're fresh raisins
Edna you want some
Stan do you
no I want some of this blue cheese
blue cheese and rye bread
blue cheese and crackers
Abe
would you like some walnuts
you sure
Edna would you
three o'clock
what happens at three o'clock
let's see at three o'clock you'll probably be taking a nap
uhhuh
time to eat
no twelve o'clock is time to eat lunch
at twelve o'clock we eat lunch
Abe this boy at the co_op told me a real good thing to do with yogurt
you put cream cheese and yogurt and a little bit of milk
a milk shake
would you like a milkshake
that's what we had a Burger_King last night
okay I'll fix you one
that's a number six
it says it is three thirty
it says it's three thirty
no that's the number six
right
uhhuh see the little hand is pointing to the three when the big hand points to the six
that means it's half past the hour
that's difficult to explain
sure is
you want to make a pot of coffee
go ahead
I didn't say
would you like for me to make it
would you like some coffee Ann
yeah
okay I'll make some
I'll always drink coffee
this is rice
why don't you make it
why don't we start making it again
I'm going to wait until we get a glass coffee pot
you really spoiled us Edna
but your coffee pot makes really good coffee
no I think it's too strong
I thought it was good when we were camping
but it's too strong otherwise
yeah
see all the rice
he tricks Ernie
because sometimes Ernie tricks him
that's how they that's how they have their fun Abe
they play games with each_other
go ahead and have a few
would you like a few walnuts
just want me to fix you a yogurt milkshake
do you want some cheese and crackers
just want me to fix your yogurt
I'll get around to it Abe sooner or later
did you tell Edna what happened at Burger King last night
do you want a yogurt milkshake
Stan do you
what did you have_to drink Abe
you do
okay wonder where the blender is
why don't you just mix it up by hand
because I don't need one
you don't
no because it looks like it's going to be a real hassle
if it's not going to be a real hassle I'll go ahead and take it
you want me to do it with the mixer
that's a good answer
that's a good solution
that's called cream cheese
that's part of the ingredients for your milkshake
I'm glad you like it
I can't take too much blue cheese at one time
no I have_to do that in little bitty pieces
uhhuh
uhhuh
well good
you want another bite
do you want any more
of this
no of the blue cheese
oh cream cheese and rye bread are supposed to be real good you all want to eat some
I was being very careful
I cut it downwards
and I should have held the knife in a different direction
but maybe I should
but I knew what I was doing
I wouldn't cut myself
I was very careful
here I have about twenty scars on my hands
uhhuh do you want ta put the beaters in
you asked me to use the mixer to make your milkshake right
the blender the blender then
I'll go fast Edna
so you won't have_to listen to it very long
you're never that considerate when I'm using it
yogurt's part of the ingredients
your mixer isn't loud at all compared to mine
mine's
okay
yeah I'll let you push it
but don't push it until I tell you to okay
just a second
when the beaters are pointed down
okay oh that's too fast
it smells good
think it could take some more cream cheese
here's a thing to pick up a picture Ann
oh okay
you want to taste this and see if it needs more cream cheese Stan
oops I'm sorry Abe
what's it need
milk yogurt or cream cheese
honey
honey
oh that sounds good
he said
let's put honey in my milkshake
you have_to keep quiet
but I'll show you some pictures we took on our camping trip
oh
there's some more somewhere
okay I won't put any in yours
cinnamon
a honeycinnamon milkshake
okay
um I think that's really good
Edna you want little glass
no I'll taste Stan's
no you won't
at least not when you've been sick for two weeks
if she wants a little taste
you give her a little glass
I'll lick the bowl
that's what I'll do
okay
I'm still full from last night
so good to eat Mexican food
I just love it
need a glass of milk also
how does it taste Abe
taste like honey cinnamon
what else did I put in
tastes good
let's see yogurt
let's let Abe talk now
I need to go to the Earthworks
do you want ta go
you know what Abe

and I'm pretty sure you'll probably be taking your nap
it's past twelve
I'll show you what time it is
whoop
that winds it up
is that what time it is
it's quarter past
now it's half past
oh what a lazy hand
Abe you need more walnuts

in your milkshake
that's a good idea
hello hello
hi Abe what's your name
huh
what are you
a rock monster
beat me up
oh you beat me up
why don't we play with the monster later
Ann
could I have the monster
oh but it's a ghost on this side
is that Casper the friendly ghost
oh
say Halloween's over
but I have_to live
after Halloween I have_to have a friend after Halloween
is that just a ghost
it is weird to drink a milkshake that has kind_of little balls in it
little balls of cream cheese in the bottom
do you want peanut butter and crackers
who wants coffee
do you
who wants coffee
Stan
you want a peanut butter and cracker
or peanut butter and rye bread
okay
I hear a growl
there's something about fresh coffee
it's Abe
is that your tummy growling
your tongue
that's your tongue growling
Abe where's your tongue
where's that
huh
when you lick stuff
when you lick stuff
can you bite stuff with your tongue too
but you can bite your tongue right
didn't you bite your tongue this morning
Ann's really impressed with that kind of game
what
oh that show you saw last week
yeah that was such a neat show
which show is that
what's the name of it
the wishing game or something weird
oh I'd like to see that
it's what was that one
I don't know
Abe who's on the Wishing_Game
like a_lot_of people have been taking baths
but strangely enough not a bath is missing
okay Ann that's a long enough description
oh that's great
oh I was isn't that neat though
the whole show's like that
does Abe like it
yeah because they split this one guy stands with a guitar and goes from scene to scene
Abe why don't you drink milk and let Edna hear the sound you make
will I be scared
that's funny
he gets so tickled when he does that
what makes that sound Abe
in your throat
what's it called
do you have a word for that sound
it's called gulping
but you can gulp without making that noise too
does anybody want a University_Of_Minnesota
second one they've sent me
throw it away
we're going to go see gymnastics
what
which big book
the one on the floor
is that the one you read about the elves
the story of the elves
yeah
is that the book with the elves in it Abe
just one elf
do you remember what its name was
what was the story about
some goats
Billy_Goats_Gruff
I didn't know elves were in Billy_Goats_Gruff
are they
no not elves I don't think
no elves are in the shoemaker
the shoemaker
oh the little shoemaker
was there a story about that
what happened with the little shoemaker Abe
do the elves come to see him
oh have you met a mean elf
have you met a nice elf
you have
seven of them came
something come I think uhhuh
at our house
that's right Santa_Claus and all his elves
oh that's really nice
you have met an elf
that's really neat
he might be ready for The_Hobbit man
I know
I'm so surprised you remembered
what other stories are in there Abe
there's not a shoemaker in here
it's probably The Elves_And_The_Shoemaker
we performed that as a play one time
yeah right that's the story isn't it
what's this
which ones are the elves
where's the shoemaker
oh
why are they the shoemakers
are they on the table too
what are they doing on the table
why do you think they're the elves
why
oh
they're smiling aren't they
what else do they do
they make people happy don't they
right
did you tell Daddy about the devil
they are
did you tell him a story about a devil
no
one day he just asked me
Mom do you like devils
it was right after you told him about the elves and the shoemaker
so I said devils are mean
yeah silly cat
what about witches
I know
that's a pretty picture
uhhuh did we read this story
what was it about
look
the hundreds and thousands and millions and billions and trillions
what is this one about
I know it
what's it about
what are you looking for
the Billy_Goats_Gruff
that's a really nice book
Stan
yeah what
it's not under the Billy_Goats_Gruff unless it's under the
probably
oh three billygoats
here's how this works Abe
you turn back here
and you find the three Billy_Goats_Gruff and it says to turn to one one eight
uhhuh what's this
what happened in that one
did the billygoat talk
you want me to read it to you all
man I really like that story
Daddy said he would
I really got into this story last night about this volcano down in Peru
the kids all talked Spanish
so I started talking Spanish
and Abe just looked at me
oh I can turn off the tape and turn it back on
yeah
fine yeah do
Daddy's gonna read you a story
okay I'm gonna turn off the tape and read a story
remind me
I like to read Peter_Rabbit
it's a really boring story
who read you that one
that is a nice one
but God it's dumb
um
could I look at your book a second Abe
I want ta see Billy_Goats_Gruff
The_Elves_And_The_Shoemaker is a nice story too isn't it Abe
I said that the elves and the shoemaker is a nice story too isn't it
he said the adults were the elves
and the little elves were the shoemakers which makes sense
because they're playing with all of the tools aren't they
oh that's right huh
that's what I meant
the elves were at the door
do they look like elves because they were all friendly
you want a peanut butter apple Abe
don't turn the tv on
Minnesota football's on

I thought you did like those but you didn't like the other part

okay just a second Edna oh
Edna had to go get her kitty cats
you can talk if you want to though
let me see
her kitty cats are running all over
and she has_to go get them
is she there
I bet that she'll call you later after she gets her kitties
because she wants to talk to you
I know
she had to go get her kitties
not quite
just a little while
you are
who's not naughty
oh horses are so nice
do you need to go pottie
no
do I need to go pottie
no do you
okay let me help you
okay
it sure is
you want some balls that are in that closet
let me see if I can find them
nope I can't find them
I don't see them
Mom do you know what balls Abe's talking about
tennis balls I think
oh these balls Abe
did you show Daddy your new animals Abe
let me see
uhhuh what new animals do you have
wow
and there's the cat and the dog and the goat and the turtle
isn't it a goat
uhhuh
what race
oh that's probably right Abe
a lion can run a_lot faster than a gorilla
where did you get those animals
you wanted a buffalo
well sometimes things don't work out just right
do you like your gorilla and your lion
maybe you'll get one for Christmas if you ask Santa_Claus
oh
did you see the surprise Abe made me
wow
what a pretty picture
you didn't
I wish that you would make me a surprise
don't you love me
that's a good idea
would you like some popcorn
uhhuh ask Mommy if we have any popcorn
yeah Daddy can make it if he wants to
would you like for me to make it
would you help me
why can't you help me now
are you putting them up
where
okay here you go
you told me what
that you were going to help me
why
don't you like soggy popcorn
uhhuh
uhhuh
I didn't get very much
you're not supposed to use very much
do you know why
why
guess
right
is that big
which stuff should I use
the stick or the Bluebonnet
it doesn't matter
is this corn_butter
oh
no I think this will be enough
okay
okay I will
oh I uh I thought that we would have popcorn when we watched the movie
no The_Cowboys
as_soon_as another show is over
where's the popcorn at
I see
is that enough
just about
in just a little while
right
think it's ready to pop
I hear it
do you want to shake the popcorn
okay
you make popcorn at school
Abe do you want to tell Daddy what you told Brian today at school
is that right
what did Brian say
what did Brian say
that's not what you told me
no it's not
that's not the story you told me
well what else happened
oh you're being too silly
did you play outside today
what'd you play on
just walked around
if the weather's good we're going to have a football game Sunday
good
if it was warm it'd be alright
what
oh you're going to push my head off my neck
you have a strong head
you're just like a billygoat
you have a real strong head
tell Daddy about when the billygoat jumped on the fence
tell Daddy about the billygoat at the zoo
how come
he didn't reach what
oh
I really like dipping bread in soup
it repulses me
it gets so soggy
I hate doing dishes and feeling something sticky when there's a piece of bread in the water that I didn't see when I was cleaning off the plates
oh that's a horrible feeling
I like it better than rice
because rice all floats on the water
and it's like sticking your hands in quick sand all those little things
what Abe
I'm not Daddy
okay what are you gonna tell me
you're a goose
I've got a good idea
why don't you put on a pot of coffee
okay
what
what do you want to take to the movies
okay what do you want to take to the movies
candy
and Daddy
who else or what else
carrots
a sandwich
what are you going to do with acorns Abe
what would you do with them
you'd take peanuts
bananas
would you see the movie
or would you just be eating all the time
Abe what's on tonight
what movie's on tonight
yes it's Friday night
what movie's on
I'm here
what movie's on
what movie are we going to watch since Edna's here
what does Edna remind you of
right right
I was hoping he'd say that
what does Daddy look like
what does he look like
a peanut
go ahead
well put your head up
you're just too lazy
well figure it out
figure the problem out
find a solution
how are you
are you going to Indiana then
first before Christmas
what Abe
you're naughty
tell Edna what you like to be when you ring
a bee with a belt on
is that what you said Abe
what's that
what's that
you're just being so silly tonight
I can't believe it
you want to help me make coffee Abe
that was a pretty song
you having a parade Abe
we almost had a cat in our house Abe
Abe what is your throat doing
what is your throat doing
why
what are you doing Abe
you are
can we be in your parade
can we be in your parade
we can't
what instrument are you playing Abe
a horn
I can
I can't
the parade's all over
Abe don't keep that in your mouth when you move around
remember what I told you
if you fell on it it'd really hurt your throat
just when you're sitting or standing
you look tired Ann
I am for some reason
I don't know why
I am too
I know why my eyes hurt and my finger
your eye and your finger
two fingers really
how come
working or writing
doing that analysis
what Abe
do you have_to go pottie
okay
where're you going
oh
how come you have_to poopoo
I don't think so tonight
because to play bridge you need four people
and there are just three big people
you want to learn to play bridge Abe
how come
it's over on the table
are you going to let us be in your parade please
okay
oh now it's a parade hat
tell Edna what other kind of hat it is
that's quite a combination Abe
did you swing
wow hey Abe would you like to drink some water to see if you can get rid of your hiccups
take a big big long sip
being around you two drowsy people would make anyone feel tired
did you get rid of them
good
huh
hey mama
it's over on the table if you'd open your eyes and look around
