said Lampwick

Pinocchio held up the bag and to his surprise Lampwick grabbed it and ran away
that was the end of the candy
what happened
asked Jiminy Cricket
where is all your father's money
I lost it
said Pinocchio
right away his nose grew still longer
look at that nose
that's what happens when you tell lies
do you know that June
no you didn't believe it huh
you did not lose the money
said Jiminy
you used it for candy
at least take what is left and buy a little food for Gepetto
what do you think
you don't want to
you don't think he should buy food
as he walked towards home Pinocchio held the bag in front of his face as he did not want anyone to see his long nose
can you tell the rest of the story
no why not
well anyway here's the fox and the cat hiding by this wooden bridge here
do you see anything else there
what's this
what about that
uh oh
as he walked towards home Pinocchio held the bag in front of his face
he did not want anyone to see his long nose
a sly old fox and a thin hungry cat were hiding by a bridge
look at that little wooden head
said the hungry cat
he has a sack full of food
there's Pinocchio
what's he got June
no
well my fine lad
said the fox
you look like the kind of boy who might want to see a puppet show
a puppet show
cried Pinocchio
oh yes I certainly would
how can I get in
what's this June
can you tell me what this is
no you just want Pinocchio
I have a ticket
said the fox
if you'll give us your food I will give you my ticket
that is your sack of food isn't it
oh yes
said Pinocchio
another lie and his nose grew longer
see
what's this June
but he didn't care
he had his ticket
what does bunny think
a line of people were waiting to get into the puppet show
they got mad at Pinocchio when he bumped them with his long nose
better not tell any more lies
said Jiminy Cricket
you already have too much nose for a puppet your size
look at the people June
what's this
is that a little girl huh
can you tell the story June
what's Pinocchio doing
is he crying
hm
how about this book
can you read this one to me
what about this one
can you tell me where the train is
how about the doggie
uhoh I guess we'd better get Pinocchio back then
now let's see
step up step up
called the man waiting at the ticket stand
Pinocchio stepped up and gave the man his ticket
this is no ticket
said the man
it's just a piece of paper
go away little boy and take your long nose with you
poor Pinocchio had no money no food no ticket
he just sat down on a box and began to cry
look at Pinocchio
what's he doing
he's crying
just then a man peeped out_of the tent
the man was Stromboli the puppet manager
my_my
said Stromboli
a puppet without any strings
do you do anything but cry little puppet
I can sing and dance
said Pinocchio
show me
said Stromboli
what's Pinocchio doing
Pinocchio danced and sang
he turned cartwheels
he even stood on his head
look at that
then Stromboli showed his puppets to Pinocchio
he pulled the strings and the puppets kicked their feet
what's that
oh you don't need any strings
said Stromboli
come with us and you will be the star of our show
don't listen Pinocchio
said Jiminy
go home to Gepetto
but Pinocchio did not want to go home
he wanted to be a star
the show started and Pinocchio began to dance
look no strings
he called
everybody cheered
but the other puppets had strings and Pinocchio's long nose got caught in those strings
he crashed to the floor
everybody started laughing
suddenly Pinocchio was very unhappy
he didn't like to have people laugh at him
I'm not such a great star after all
he said
I want to go home to Gepetto
no no you're not going home
said Stromboli
you belong to me now
this birdcage will be your new home
help
called Pinocchio from inside the cage
let me out
but the puppets did not help
they couldn't move unless someone pulled the strings
but Jiminy could go get help
can you tell me the story
no
can you tell me who this is
Jiminy ran quickly to Gepetto's house
Gepetto
he called
you must come and save Pinocchio
Stromboli the puppet+master put him in a cage
and so Jiminy and Gepetto went down a dark street
Gepetto was carrying a lantern in one hand
they found Pinocchio in his cage in Stromboli's tent
don't worry my son
said Gepetto
I will help you
he took Pinocchio out_of the cage
suddenly Stromboli came running in
thief
he cried
that's my puppet
run Pinocchio
shouted Gepetto
and so they ran but Gepetto fell into a trunk and Stromboli came after him
I will save you father
cried Pinocchio
what's Pinocchio doing June
alright he went up the ladder and lifted the puppets off their place on the rung and lifted them onto Stromboli
Stromboli is underneath all the puppets there
and Pinocchio saved Gepetto and they all went home
can you read the rest of it
okay then Gepetto looked at Pinocchio and asked
what happened to your nose
and Pinocchio started to tell the truth and his nose got shorter and shorter
finally Pinocchio decided that he would never tell another lie
