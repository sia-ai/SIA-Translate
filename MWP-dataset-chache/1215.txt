let's see what else's in the here
these are different stories
I wanna look for a different story
oh here's a Loly Worm story okay let's go back and stick this one
the story is called the talking bread
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough
they are making dough for bread
you've seen me do that haven't you
yes I use a rolling pin when I make bread
that's the dough that's a lot of dough look at all the
they are kneading the dough
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes
balls yep bowls are like balls
then Humper Dink
that pig's name is Humper Dink put the uncooked loaves of bread in the hot oven to bake
that's the oven
they're putting the bread dough into the oven to bake it
okay what happens over here
after the loaves
look at all that bread on the wagon
there must be twenty loaves of bread there
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool
oh here you're right on Mommy's microphone I didn't realize that
mm mm mm fresh bread smells good
Mama Humper Dink says Mama

I must telephone Sargent_Murphy he said
the bread said Mama
sergeant Murphy

arrived in a hurry
he is driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle
cause he was in such a hurry
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread
Mama
