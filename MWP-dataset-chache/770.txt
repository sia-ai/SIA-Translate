I might
are we going to the football game with Mommy

you do
I didn't know that
we can go outside and play later on okay

how come
how come your shoes won't hurt after you take them off
okay let's get those shoes off wow
look at all the sand in your shoes
I won't

why
if I spill it you can sweep it up

that's okay
I'll get it later on

in a little while after Mommy gets home
then we'll go
uhhuh she went to school to get some things
some tools and stuff for her pottery class
you do
when you went to school with Mommy you ran around the room in circles
I bet that you got really tired
you didn't
Mommy told you that you would fall down if you kept running around in circles
did you fall down
that was probably a good idea
what's going on here
hi Abe
hi Mom

one of the stores was closed
but I got this
oh that's nice for engraving

Abe really wants to go Mom
do you want to make some popcorn Abe

giggle

that's a good reason
if you ask me to
okay bring it here
am I dry
come here and let's put your pants on

yeah I was
and then I got_to be as big as Karen
yeah and then I got_to be as big as Faith
and now I'm as big as me
yes I am
what
you are a silly boy
how come
because it was dirty
really
what happens is that when the air hits it it gets the moisture out and makes it dry
come here and feel it
is it dry
because he likes you
I don't know
sometimes I wonder
you do
do you like that
oh
where
there was a woodpecker at the feeder
well he'll probably come back
go ahead
okay
okay you turn it on
oh let's watch nine
okay go ahead whoa
somebody turned the tv on too loud didn't they
who did that
that's right
this is about the right volume isn't it
you don't
well let's watch just a little of it okay
maybe you will after
they are apples
yeah
we can't decide which to make pizzas or tacos
why don't we have both
uhhuh right
when are we going to make that
on Friday or Thursday
we were thinking about using that hot cheese on tacos you know in slices
okay you'd rather have pizza
okay
I'm glad Abe
how did you do that
it hurt
but it didn't break the skin Abe
how did you hurt your leg Abe
your knee
how did you do that
oh
I thought you fell down in the parking lot
on the rocks in the parking lot
what Abe
you miss me
well Abe I've been missing you too
you're going to come over to my house on Sunday
that's tomorrow
the kitten is really getting big
did you tell Edna who you played with last night Abe
Lynnie
did you have a good time
Abe didn't have his nap and didn't feel like being mothered
you got what
he took a nap at Lynnie's house
oh
oh did you take a nap while you were there
from about twelve forty five to two o'clock
she's beautiful really sweet
that's good
she likes you too Abe
Do you remember Janine
do you remember Janine
maybe you'll get to play with Janine tomorrow
will that be okay
good
you can walk around and pick up apples together
we'd better not talk about that
there might not be any apples
we'll come over early tomorrow
you miss me
good I miss you too
when do you miss Dad
uhhuh
she has long shoestrings doesn't she
all the way up
I know are they going to keep your feet warm in the winter
uhhuh
and picking berries
and waking up and cooking breakfast on the campfire
that's what I want to do the weekend of the twenty seventh
yes
and make some hot rolls to bring and warm up on the fire
that's a good idea you had Abe
see some bears
and find raccoons
and look for other animals' footprints
antelopes xxx yeah
I like canteloupes too Abe
when did you ever eat one
I've been trying to get you to eat them ever since you were born
still haven't eaten any
uhhuh see one tree doesn't have any leaves left now
oh this is just beautiful
would you like a grilled cheese sandwich
would you like your yogurt now
yeah yogurt now
yeah yogurt now
I'd like some yogurt too
no you won't
oh I can't have any
you can
I'd like just a taste
I've never tasted your yogurt
thank_you Abe
Abe you're getting so good about sharing your things
oh that coffee pot smells so good
we should probably keep that always you_know with water boiling in it or something
just have the smell generated throughout the house
uhhuh oh could you all bring it over tomorrow
you want us to bring that one or the sixteen cup
oh the big one yeah
food coloring
this is what he puts in his yogurt
just about makes my stomach turn
peanut butter
peanut butter and food coloring
Yuk
Abe that doesn't even sound good
Abe loves it
Ugh
what color is it going to be this week Abe
or today well tell us
you don't
you want yellow
he didn't ask for yellow
you want yellow now
you're supposed to stir it up Abe
oh you're licking the spoon I see
good idea to lick the spoon
well it looks better than I thought it would
what about my kittycat
you like it
oh I do too
she'll like you I bet too
she's beginning to like to play with people
Abe what color is your yogurt now
uhhuh what happened to the yellow
sure did
getting full
eat it all up
you have a mustache
what color do you think it is
how could it be white if your yogurt's green
I think you're being silly
did you tell Edna what was on the wall in the living room last night
in Lynnie's house
a what
a frog
on the wall
they have a frog in the bathroom holding soap in his mouth a night light of a frog and all different sorts of posters of animals
did you see the bobcat in the living room
how did they get the bobcat
oh they found the bobcat one day
and it had frozen to death in the snowstorm
so they skinned it
Mina's Dad has a ranch
now that's not a good idea
just if you need to protect yourself
otherwise we'll just let them live their own life
why would you kill them
he said we're not
oh we're not going to
we want them to do as they want to do right
mushrooms did you tell Daddy about all the mushrooms we found yesterday
really
where at
over on the volleyball court they're everywhere
I bet there were seventy five mushrooms out there
after all of that rain
are those toadstools or mushrooms
toadstools
they are
they look pretty smooth to me
go ahead
I think you're going the wrong direction
wow that felt good
what
you want to comb my hair
um I don't know if I can take this Abe
I'll tell you what I'll give you this part to comb here
comb this part here oh ah
there you go
um
okay
you going to be a barber when you grow up
what are you going to be
what do they do
gibberish
you have_to transcribe that huh
a potter
you going to work with a potter's wheel
oh
are you going to make pots
what are you going to do
that's his word for f a r t
did you tell Edna what you did yesterday
will you zoom all over the house
we wouldn't be able to see you if you were poo_poo_gas
course we'd be able to tell that you were around
we could really smell that
I think you're really being silly
you are
can I chew you
oh what a faker
keep it up
Abe what big teeth you have
why do you have big teeth
oh that makes sense
do you have big toes too
do you have a little toe
you don't
what happened to it
what happened to your little toe
hey that would be fun
what would you do if you were a bird
ride on the bird
do you know how big a bird would be for you to ride on it
I'd have_to be as big as a horse
Bilbo and the Eagle
yeah
I do too
will they keep your feet warm in the winter
yeah they're nice boots
you are
you'd really have_to have long legs wouldn't you
you're going to be fat
what would make you fat
it would if it didn't come out
hey Abe what if you didn't grow up
what if you stopped growing up and grew out sideways and just got wider and wider
in the what
in the sun
oh that'd be hot
I think Abe went bananas
I think so
I've never seen a banana poop in the pottie
I've never seen a banana walking or eating
did you show Edna the picture you drew at school
oh yeah on the door
oh that one
it's a see anemone he said
see a seaanemone
a seaanemone
what's a seaanemone
I don't know what that is
long fins
here
do they go swoosh like that in the water
yeah
right
what's the red part
is that part of the seaanemone
animal
he said anemone how
anemone
like a lizard
for all those people
you're going to make so many people happy
well it'll dry
did you finish
I think that's a different type of seaanemone
you_know you can really make a_lot_of Christmas presents for people if you make them pictures
oh I'd really like that kind of Christmas present Abe hint hint
okay you want to now
with your colore pastels or with your color pencils or with your color crayons
or water colors
I do too
you made a_lot_of real good pictures with that
really terrific huh
huh here are some walnuts you haven't eaten
you don't
I'm going to save your yogurt for you so you can eat it later on
it might have some chemical reaction by the time it sets
oh those are nice water colors
did you tell Edna who got them for you
didn't Terry
do you miss Terry
you don't
you're pretty straight forward Abe
you have any idea what you're going to paint
well here you know why
feel the brush
it's still really hard from the last time you painted
that's pretty interesting though Abe
those are really nice lines
I like them
I don't see how you made it as a matter of fact
because the brush was like a pen
okay now you can feel it
it's soft now
uhhuh
you got it out_of the red color
but it ended up being purple on the paper
I think it's the last time you used red you mixed it with purple
uhhuh it's also black
uhhuh
you can do it this way
uhhuh
what are you making Abe
give him lots_of pretty fins
oh he's making the fins now
yeah
those are really nice fins
they're all over the place alright
let me wipe these off so you can get the true color okay
whoops m okay
no the sun went behind a cloud
so there's a big shadow over our house
I thought you turned the light off too
oh Abe that's a beautiful anemone
you know I learned to call them anemones when we go to Florida Abe
we may see some of them
Abe's been talking about finding octopuses in the ocean when we go there
good luck
are you thinking about the jelly fish and the Men_o_War we saw once
the animals
the water paints the finger paints
oh uhhuh oh that's a pretty blue Abe
uhhuh why is it pretty
because it's dark
shows up better
wow I like that
purple's always my favorite
uhhuh
say I think you're getting too much water on the brush
Abe where'd the seaanemone go
where's your sea animal go
I know
but where is it
is it still there
it's going to be a huge one
oh is it going to fill the whole paper
I sure would like to see what you made
what are you making
oh I see a pillow
what
oh okay
I don't know
what are you going to get me for my birthday
what kind
will you tell me when you get home what it is

oh well goodbye
are you back from the store
did you get me something
what
we have_to wait until Saturday Dad
oh I want it now
Saturday
I do
I'm not
oh
did you have fun at the store
tell Dad what we did at the store
really
oh ice cream so we can share it
that's a good idea
are you going to have some now
no I have_to do dishes first
because they weren't done when I got home
did you expect them to be
uhhuh did you tell Daddy that you smiled big for your picture
that's good
that's good too
here you go
you were
you got medicine
how come
the doctor said that I should take it didn't he
it's called m
they're just little yellow pills
they're yellow
no you can't eat these
because_of all the chemicals that they put in it
well if they make me better then I'll like them
did you tell Daddy that you saw a little infant at the store too
what was she doing
oh she was just being a baby
her big sister was there too
oh a big baby and a little baby huh
she was just three weeks old
uhhuh
the baby
you didn't see the three week old baby
did you tell Dad that we walked down to Minnesota_Fabrics today
with four boys
there weren't any babies
are you a baby
why
I am not
that's right
but I'm not a donkey
so I don't need any hay
Abe told me that he was a chicken
oh yeah
what are chickens for
he said that it would be hard to have a pig in the house
you used to be a pig
what are you now
oh
what
oh
it looks like a candleholder to me
it's broken
it's not broken
it melted
uhhuh
it's a wick
you can't burn a candle if you don't have a wick
not exactly a wick is part of a candle
that's what you meant right Abe
oh
right now
you can go tomorrow okay
why don't we go read some books
okay go ahead
Abe don't
you ruined my lunch bag
oh I can put my lunch in the white bag huh
okay do you think it's big enough
you do
would you like to take a bath with me
would you like to take a bath with me
are you sure
okay you'll regret it not me
when
when
you took a bath after you ate lunch
why did you take a bath then
you don't need ice cream
you do
ask your mother
I think so
who's hot
oh
well Mommy's a girl
and we're boys
because it takes a boy and a girl to make a baby
if we didn't have boys and girls then we wouldn't have any babies
they do
today
Jean watched you when Mommy went to the store
did you make a new candle
did you know that Mommy knows how to make candles
with wax and coloring and different scents
no you put stuff in like food coloring
and then you mix it all up
what did you do at school today Abe
Abe told me that he played with Sarah
did you play with Sarah Abe
what did you do
plastic candles
oh
that looks like white
who wants ice cream
I do
uhhuh from Grandma
do you have a stamp
did you pull it off the letter
you open the top of the envelope
the envelope is the container that the letter's in
this one is big enough
I'm putting it in this one okay
Abe what are you going to be for Halloween
you're going to be Robin
bet that you're right
does Superman fly
I can make you fly too
is that right
okay I'll put you down
is today my birthday
oh that's so nice
what are we going to do tonight
are we going to do anything tonight
what about going to Jack and Karen's
okay we'll go there tonight
I think that we might be able to arrange that
let me see what's on your face
it looks like something froze on your face while you were outside
what do you think it was
I think it was probably a chicken
is that right
what do they do
oh chicken's eat a_lot
what food
chickens don't eat people food
what are you doing
are you going inside
okay I will
is that your cave
I will
I am
where's Abe at
you don't want me to say that
okay I won't
I sure do wish that I knew where he was
I sure do wish that I knew where Abe was
oh well I'm glad that I know where he is now
you're a nice bear
be careful
do you want to make me a cake
that sure would be nice
you can as_soon_as Mommy comes home
you wanna watch some tv
we will in just a little while
what can we do until then
what kind of cake are you going to make
really
that sounds like a good idea to me
what
you're going to stand on top of that box and watch tv
that's pretty dangerous
we will in just a little while
what can we do until then
why don't we talk
what did you do when you went to school with Mommy today
Mommy's pottery room was closed
what happened after that
you didn't
what else happened
did you go anywhere
didn't you go the Dinkey_Town
Dinkey_Town was closed
do you remember when Daddy honked at you
you didn't
oh was I going too fast
your panties has a hole in it
let me see
oh is Mommy going to fix it
is Mommy going to fix that hand
oh you want it to stay that way
hey
I have an idea
let's look at the pictures
and you tell me what's going on okay
okay we'll take turns
what were you doing here
what were you walking to
you're walking to a tree
what about this one
uhhuh that's right
who are you going with
uhhuh
she's at the store right
again
what about this picture
are you doing any tricks
what are you doing there
is that what happened
and you remembered that
do you know if it really happened
oh what about this one
oh what are you making it with
look and tell me what's in your beaver dam okay
uhhuh now tell me what you used all of those things for
uhhuh you can also build a beaver dam with all that can't you
don't you want to look at any more pictures
okay I'll put them up
what do you want to do
we will later on okay
do you know what
Halloween is coming pretty soon
what are you going to be on Halloween
are you going to be Robin
oh what are you going to do on Halloween
is that what Halloween is all about
you want to get candy after you watch tv
get me the schedule and I'll see what's on
are you going to get it
or do you want me to get it
it's right over there
let me see
I hear Mommy yelling for help
let's go help her
we're coming Mom
well the bananas aren't quite ripe yet
I got some good fish Dad
I'll show it to you
how about an apple
how about a pear
okay just a second and I'll get you whatever you want
okay hold on for just a second
let me finish putting the groceries away
what dropped
oh I think that you did that on purpose
you did didn't you
I'm putting the celery away
oh did you play in it
thanks for picking up some of the junk off of the floor
you cooperated
how nice
uhhuh and one middle full of peanut butter
okay
I'll put it on top of the peanut butter
eat that
and then we'll go
we have_to take our turntable back
because it doesn't work right
I'm making applesauce for Daddy's birthday cake
you made applesauce at school
did you eat some
it looks like he's getting into the tool box
he probably needs some tools
to fix something
just a moment please
hm
are you sure
you've got everything figured out don't you Abe
I just said that you have everything figured out
because you're such a smartie
what
yeah but I couldn't find the small one
it's hidden somewhere
are you done eating
that's okay
one piece of crust isn't very important
no do you want another sandwich
okay here's the grape jelly
because Grandma got a_lot_of grapes and made jelly out_of them
Karen is
oh I bet that she would really like that
are you about ready to go
okay I saw a garage sale on the way to the store
would you like to go to that
uhhuh we can go if you want to
we'll have_to wait and see
they might not have anything that you'd want
that's a good idea
but we'll have_to wait and see what they have at the garage sale
just a second let me use the bathroom
do you have_to teetee
I have_to sit down when I teetee
couldn't I stand up if I wanted to
teetee
wait in here instead okay
I'll only be a second
where's Mommy
oh what are you doing
and you're just going to sit here
oh really
are you
they sure are
what are they
uhhuh what else do you see
they will
you hope that they'll all scare me
why
why do you hope that witches and ghosts and goblins will scare me
I'm a good boy
they sure would if I ever saw any
are they going to scare you too
would Mommy be scared if she saw a ghost
both mommies and daddies are scared of ghosts and witches and goblins
why
they will
what will they do if they catch us
we better run fast if we see any ghosts huh
oh well we'll all go trickortreating together
so no ghosts or goblins will bother us okay
I just thought that we'd all go trickortreating together on Halloween
you don't
oh well Abe trickortreating is the name for getting candy on Halloween
when you knock on people's doors they open the door
and you say trickortreat
and then they give you candy see
trickortreat is just a name for getting candy
well it's just a name
Abe's a name
Stan's a name
Ann's a name
some things are just names
that's all
why do you think Abe is a name
why do you think that some things are names and other things aren't names
I don't either
do we have enough popcorn to make when Mommy comes home
let me see if we have enough
oh yeah we have plenty of popcorn
no we'll wait until Mommy comes home okay
we'll have_to wait and see Abe
I don't know if she's going to bring you anything or not
would you like to paint a picture
no
how about playing with your garage
okay go ahead
oh okay I will
where are they
okay
it sure is
uhhuh I won't fall down
so you don't have_to worry
here are your animals
let me see
I think that he's just a little bit wobbly
why don't you have him lie down and sleep
well maybe after he wakes up he won't be quite as wobbly
he probably needs a pretty long nap though
uhhuh they sure are
uhhuh why don't you wake them all up now
you do
what kind of game
I don't have that kind of game ready
what other kind of game would you like to play
why don't we play a acrobatic game
you can do somersault and stuff okay
you did
wow
did you go very high
and you jumped from that high up
oh do you ever climb down
oh do you ever fall
you didn't watch what you were doing and you fell down
did you hurt yourself
you spit to get the dirt out
that's right
after you spit were you okay
that's good idea
you should watch when you go to your tumbling class too
