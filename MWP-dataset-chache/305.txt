I used to have this when I was a little girl do you know that
I used to have this
this exact toy

oh sure
oh I can move it and make it more comfortable for you if you'd like
why is it bugging you

you didn't tell Jenell what we saw while we were coming here
what'd you see
when we came up the stairs what did we see
do you remember
yeah that is a book yes
do you remember what we saw when we were coming up the stairs
you have to tell Jenell
she'd love to know
what did you see
remember the lady on the stairs what was she doing
remember she was so nice to us
what was she doing the lady on the stairs what was she doing
she was cleaning
cleaning what
yeah why do you think she had to do that
was she very nice to us
did she talk to us
do you remember what she said
I don't remember
you know she probably told us to be careful right
so why
because she didn't want us to to what
I don't remember
we were supposed to be careful on the stairs
because she was cleaning them and she didn't want us to
yeah probably
yeah
I think you're right
because sometimes you know when things get wet they get really slippery
but I think we should definitely tell Jenell that there are very nice people
mhm
work here and let us know how to be careful
somebody in the bookcase what is he eating
a banana
he's eating a banana

what's he
what kind of animal is he
that looks like a rooster to me
why
why is he bad
what did he do wrong
he bumped his feet
oh well that must hurt
maybe he's maybe he's hurt
maybe he's not bad
