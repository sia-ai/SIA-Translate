well
Rachi and I went and tried to park our car
it was pretty hard to find a parking space near there
jammed up like anything
oi
Harold would you help her a little bit
um
what's a matter
there was long long lines of people
when you finally got in you saw five no five on each side ten like booths
little gay like little teeny houses
very teeny
just big enough for one person
they was what
they xxx
and they was too little
they was too little
did they let you take her in
yeah they was just big enough for one person
Rachi and I went in
and you push a a lever like a little button on the side
something you push down
I think to the right
and the curtains close behind you so only you are inside
and nobody can see what you're voting
remember
and then you push down the little levers
like one says Carter and one says
Ford
and who are the candidates for Congress
Senate
Congress
Neelea
and the other guy I forgot
but who's the candidate for this district
Nealea
one who's running for reelection
give me
congressman
the U_S Congress
oh I don't remember
was it O'Neil
I didn't even recognize
O'Neil O'Neil
was it O'Neil
yeah I was glad
I didn't even know we was in
I felt so xxx
thought we was in Drinan's district
no that's Brookline and Newton
um
what did you say John
I was probably taken off the
then at the very end
give me give me apple juice
at the
okay
at the very end then you press
after you vote for all the people you want to vote like one person for President one person for senator
you vote for different things
you then when you're all done you press that lever to the left
but if you press two people for President it won't work
would you want to press the whole thing to finish voting it won't work
it won't click
it'll be stuck
I think
well
is that right
unh
I love these mushrooms
so another words um voting+machines can't be void
only paper ballot can be void
Mommy look um look
and that's what happened
got some
what
look
Donald Duck's xxx
yeah here's Donald Duck
then the the machine wouldn't work
when you tried to press it off on at the very end of all your voting you have_to press one pin to make the machine click
and that way your turn is finished
but if you voted for both of them
what is that called Ima
the voting+machine
the polling+place
no what that I go in your box
oh this
uh meat and rice
you want some more
yeh
I want some too
okay me too
so if you didn't click
if you voted for more than one then at the very end when you go to press it down it won't click
and it won't click until you change it until you change it to vote for only one of them
Johnny did Jack teach you
that was cute

his teacher Jackie asked me where we got his shirt
mhm
he was wearing yesterday his shirt
yeah
so she asked me where we got it
she said her daughter gave a friend who went back to Israel a present of a Cookie_Monster shirt
so the friend wants to have printed on it in Hebrew or her daughter wants it
yeah
so the this is my best friend
I don't know
oh yeah
so she asked me if I know of any place where they print in Hebrew
in Hebrew
I thought what a fantastic business in New York that would be very goo
yeah
here it wouldn't be good
I told her to ask the Hebrew Bulletin
they'll probably throw her out_of the store
I don't doubt it
what did you say
let's eat
well just in general Carter xxx
who would you vote for
I'd vote on Carter
when we went to vote remember
do you know what Carter was before
he was a farmer
this is terrible
I mean
and know what he grew on his farm
guess
oi
please
you know what he grew on his farm
peanuts
really
that humor
so what huh
I still have a xxx
I re I remember when I was in second grade
they say he wasn't a good peanut farmer altogether
yeah
that's right
he left
no
he was never a peanut farmer
he's a broker
a peanut broker
he doesn't grow peanuts
he buys them from the surrounding farms
oh
and he sells them
I don't know which is I don't know what's true
who cares
a funny guy
he was a captain in a submarine
and he was also a Governor
that's true
he was in charge of the whole state but not the state of Massachusetts
the state of Georgia
cause every state needs somebody in charge of it
supposedly
John why don't ya why don't you eat your meat
you like that
I remember when in the second grade they had a mock election
they had a mock election today
am I right
oops
yeah who came in xxx
very interesting though
you had to push the little things and then you push you push the big thing
and then the curtains opened
and you were finished

I go uh for Ford
where Bill xxx and a what's his name
Salinger
Tome Salinger
Bobby xxx

what story is that
voting
we said I would say mine and then you would how it was when you voted
I ran up
practically nobody there
I thought it would be packed
but apparently it was just after the lunchtime rush
I went into the booth
I pushed all the levers on one line
I didn't no I didn't
I voted for
register of deeds
I did not vote for Mrs Hicks
oh you know I may have voted for her
she was the Democrat and I figured should I vote for the Democrat
and I I made I was propagandized by Smith's ads
no
what I did was I I stopped for each of the resolutions
I read each of the
I did too
and voted
and then
some of then had no opposition
I know
not the resolutions the candidates
yeah candidates
these was all democrats
I don't think there was a single Republican who had no opposition
that's right
whoever you don't vote for
well even if we voted for somebody else
xxx I don't think I voted for a single Republican
isn't the President
yeah
the only thing is that
let's say we voted for one person but all the other people voted for another person
the other person would win
no
I see how it works
I took my time on the resolutions the referendum questions
all finished
okay
you have_to urinate
you sure
I made individual choices on the first four spots
and on the rest I just went right down the line
I didn't even
most of them down on the on the botton was not um were running unopposed
that's true
Jimmy Carter would win
I just wanted to make sure last time
that what
I going in there
I don't think so
because they're working in there
