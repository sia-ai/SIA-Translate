Roman I don't like this your being mean
I don't like the way you're talking to people not only is it not informative it's mean
slow down
stop okay just settle down
should we tell Karen to go home
yeah
because I don't like the way you're not really behaving during this session
well she came to visit
yeah you know what your gonna lose a sticker
yeah this is a good example of bad behavior
no
can you tell Karen about our new sticker system
how does it work
why not
why does Mommy say you loose a sticker
okay we're gonna put these away now he's not really listening to language
this is treat and you don't really get the treat right now because we were hoping you could talk about this but your saying nothing to everything we're asking you
Roman what movie did you wanna watch
she's not asking to come she's asking you a friendly question about your movie that you wanna see
didn't you just tell Mommy that you wanted to watch a movie
no
can you tell her about why we have a movie as a reward
you don't really understand our new system
can you tell her about family night
no we're not watching tv instead
what do you wanna watch on tv
do you have a favorite tv show
no don't turn the tv on mister
because it's not time to watch tv and because your not behaving nicely a couple different reasons
you don't like this language business
well maybe we need to figure out how to change that because this is important learning about how you talk
what is in your pockets
what are you sprinkling
it's sand how did you get sand in your pockets
that's yucky Roman I don't want sand in my hair
can you explain how the sand got in there
it's magic is it magic sand
if you sprinkle the magic sand on me what's gonna happen
what's gonna happen
okay let's not do that for real though because I don't want sand all over the house and my hair

there you go
good job you got it
now what should we do with these eggs
what
decorate this table
okay
only some of them have stickers in them the ones that you found first
those are good because the two sides attach to each other
so when you found eggs at your grandma's house were they real eggs or were they plastic eggs
yeah
oh cool
the same as those
what was inside the plastic eggs at Grandma's
yes you did it
there we go
what about this one here
Roman do you like to crack real eggs open at home
when do we do that
when do we crack eggs
yes you do
when do you help Mommy crack eggs open
yeah you're right
sure
I think we need to keep this on the table okay
you can give that to me
nothing in that one huh I guess I didn't get to a lot of them
Mickey Mouse
what's Mickey Mouse doing on that sticker
oh
so who does that make it
hm do you know about Minnie Mouse

can you tell Karen about our sticker chart
do you have stickers at home
Roman
we just started a new sticker chart you know all about it
he doesn't want to talk about it
I don't know means I don't want to talk about it
would you like some help Roman

your doing a great job Roman
your decorating the table so nice
yeah
another one is it the same one
wow
you are right
sure
one of them has her eyes closed
why are her eyes closed
do you think it's fun to close your eyes
oh because they're laughing
uh oh I ripped it a little bit I'm sorry Roman there you go
maybe it's sleeping
alright
whoa that's cool how that rolled
these are all empty now you're able to roll these
and that's all the stickers

okay
hey you know what else is cool about our trip to Grandma's
we went somewhere really special the day before Easter
where did you go
think about it honey try to remember where we went
we saw bugs at this special place
you did what kind of bugs
we saw elephants we saw giraffes remember
where was that
we saw a tarantula
do you remember where we went
I'm giving you hints
we saw bats and an octopus
the octopus was kind of weird looking it was hard to tell that it was an octopus
we saw penguins
where was that that you saw all those animals
you did not get to see the octopus
yeah it was kind of hiding in the corner of its tank
wasn't that fun
what's that place called you silly
I was hoping you'd tell Karen about it because it was really fun
what else did you see there do you remember
a what the Snack Shack
yeah we went to the Snack Shack to get juice and doughnuts this morning
we went to the zoo at Grandma's
the zoo
why do you say no we didn't we went there together
what was the tarantula like at the zoo
you like spiders huh
the tarantula was in a dark room
the scorpion wasn't where was the scorpion
a light cage
that's right
it was a house
no
that was like the reptile house right
reptiles and arachnids
but your right there was a cat in that house isn't that weird
the black footed cat
okay you have_to tell us about it
do you need some help with the chalk
okay let me see
why don't we just use the chalk that's right down here
you want this chalk
we'll only take one piece out okay
yeah just one
yes one you need to listen there's plenty of pieces of chalk right there
well let's try it
can you try to make the body
that's an oval
pinchers
think about what it's tail looks like what's the stinger tail look like
oh I didn't really know that I was just helping
a little bit
where's the poisonous part
where is the poison in the scorpion
want me to help
oh you wanna make that a tail
isn't it kind of like curly here you do it
it has a like pinchers
oh is it scary it looks kinda like a lobster
leggies how many pairs of legs does it have
three pairs
okay
wow
whoa
are scorpions nice or are they mean
they're mean
why are they mean
that was mean
how is the scorpion mean
oh the pinchers are mean
what else is kind of mean look at this mean thing
shh Roman you don't need to cry I was making it even scarier
no
uhoh the chalk broke
stop this is not an example of good behavior should we erase it
no okay would you like to fix it
or add something to it
a bigger tail wanna use the eraser
here see if you can do it
okay good job you left the rest of it the way it was
you don't like the different tail you want a bigger tail
would you like to make the tail bigger yourself
do you wanna do it
like that
I'm not sure how to fix it the way you like it
oh that okay
is that a stinger
that's where the venom who should this scorpion bite
should we draw another animal that the scorpion will sting
what should he sting
uh can you make a spider
the spiders gonna say hey I thought we were friends
what's the spider gonna say
oh why wouldn't he like scorpions
the scorpion eats different insects
that's why the spider doesn't like the scorpion
mm the spiders probably right look the scorpion has both of its pinchers what's he gonna do to the spider
you can fix it
why do you have a whiny voice
oh okay I won't touch it
that's very good
and what about this one
huh what's that
oh I thought it was a jellyfish
oh do jellyfish sting too
no
actually we saw jellyfish at the zoo remember
they were so beautiful
what's this thing
oh which kind
that's excellent Roman
that's a that's a type of
this is a type of
web
right remember your exactly right the spider made a rectangular web and caught flies in it
and they jump on it like a trampoline and then they get all sticky
that's really good remembering honey
what's that
oh okay
the fly that gets caught in the spiders web
oh okay so is this a flies face
wow
ooh that's good because flies have really big eyes don't they
they have compound eyes
oh those that they have more than two eyes
wow
very good
what are these
little things that come out of their heads
oh very good
so you could tell a story about this whole picture couldn't you
what's gonna happen
oh you're gonna make the scorpion have stripes
do you remember the whip scorpion
what did he have that was different
it had a long whip like tail
it didn't have a curly stingy tail it had a long whip tail
you don't have_to I just wanted to see if you remembered it because you wanted to read about it you pointed to it and said Mommy what is this remember
very good
that was last night and this is now
very good do you think drawing is one of your favorite things
you do it a lot
you know what I think that scorpions have four pairs of legs
because they're supposed to be like spiders who have eight legs
can you count these legs
only six legs
uhoh
you're doing such a good job Roman
now are these stripes gonna make it a tiger scorpion
oh okay
did you see tigers at the zoo
you probably don't remember because they were sleeping
a lot of them were sleeping they were resting in the sunshine
there's two
two lions
we did see two lions that's right
one giraffe with the lions
a giraffe with the lions
that was the African savanna exhibit right and the giraffe was in a cage or a meadow
no that's what's nice about that zoo they don't have cages they just have open fields
what other animals did you see there Roman
yeah we saw a lota snakes didn't we
were they little snakes of big snakes
yeah
really big
were they scary
we saw anacondas and rattle snakes
did we see a cobra
no we didn't very good
flat cheeks
yeah are they poisonous
do you like snakes Roman
what
oh that's right one of those snakes squirts the poison really far right they don't even have_to bite something they just spray it
that's right we got a book out of the library about snakes
Karen asked you a question do you remember the question
what was it
do you like snakes
yeah
oh really was it a mommy snake
oh wow
yeah that was a python
it wraps its body around the eggs why does it do that
what do you think it needs to do with its eggs
kind of like a birdie
she had to make sure nobody eats the eggs
do you remember what a constrictor snake does honey
what does it do
would you like to be squeezed by a snake Roman
yeah
you think it would feel good
like a boa constrictor
that's very good I like these tiger insects
does the fly have wings
no
it's a type of fly
that doesn't fly
oh that should be easy for the spider to catch
they're not what are they
oh okay
that's good that you made that clear for us
I'm sorry
no we didn't mess up your story
we were just asking questions about it
no she did not mess up your story
you know what you actually weren't telling a story
we did not know that
why don't you start all over and tell us your story again then we won't mess it up
okay
okay
it would be hard to tell a story if you weren't talking wouldn't it
what are those that you're making
there what
the sun oh
I thought it was a spider
it looks like a spider
it's not
look at all those spiders on her back
she can't even look
oh wow
look at all those
what is she doing
you can't see the spiders can you look up close
and those are all baby spiders
she's carrying all those babies
isn't that funny
she looks like a monkey
what makes her look like a monkey
you know what I think her face really does kinda look like a monkey
it does
that's really funny that you think that
it says the babies hold on tightly
why do they have_to hold on tightly
so they won't fall off that's a really good idea
that's probably a tarantula
those are probably baby tarantulas
they're not I think they are they're not ready to leave their mommy yet that's why they're holding on tightly
what are you gonna make what picture can you make
you try to make a picture and we'll guess what it is
why why are you having a bad morning
you don't want me to guess that's okay
they key is to have a conversation about what ever your doing mister
hey I have a question Roman last week we were gonna meet and we didn't because did you go some place
no you didn't go any place
did Mommy go some place
no
you do not remember sitting in the car for a long trip
yes you do
ice cream it's so early
why did I say you could have ice cream
there was a little contingency attached to the ice cream do you remember that
it was you need to be cooperative today so I'm bribing you
Roman it's okay because when she bribes you you get ice cream
that's right
you wanna be bribed
you don't complain
but you have_to cooperate
okay well then I think it's kinda silly that you don't want to talk about why we were away because we were we all went away together
we drove in the car right do you remember what we did this weekend

remember this thing in your pocket it wants to record what you have_to say
if you just say no I don't know over and over again that's not very much data
data is information

do they read you books
no books
do you have a fish

remember that story with the little boy with round glasses
we saw Harry Potter at our house on a video
oh you haven't seen the new one
how about Finding Nemo
yeah
what happened in it
oh yeah
in the whales body
why were they in the whales body
because the whale was hungry
yeah
how'd they get out of the whales body
through the spout
right
yeah
oh because they were scared
there's a lot of dark ocean and scary fish
uh huh
the sharks
there were how many sharks were there in that movie
three sharks
yeah
and did they eat the fish
no
don't eat the toy
how many divers
I think there were a couple divers but only one caught Nemo right
where did he take him
the fish tank
back at his practice
he's a dentist
what
I'm not sure I understand your question
oh in the filter
cuz he wanted to make the tank dirty so the dentist would take the fish out of the tank so he could clean the tank
and when the fish got out of the tank they were hoping to be able to jump into the bay
so they could swim away and escape
it's a little little um inlet of water before it reaches the ocean
he always asks me questions about that movie
what did Nemo why was the daddy looking for Nemo
he loves him yeah
he did not want him to disappear
cuz he lost all his other babies right
