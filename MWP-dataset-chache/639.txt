you turn it
whoops not too fast
you can turn it over and do a different one
yes
lots_of different things
www
not too fast
a head of a turtle
now you can set this in different places and see what it does
each time you move it it gets a different design
I don't think it'll write your name but it'll make lots_of different designs
alright try
what
until this writes your name
it might do something surprising
let's make another piece of paper alright
alright
it's a little bit too big
make it a tiny bit smaller

not too fast
you need to go slower with it
isn't that pretty
that's enough

let's try it
it's a surprise
not too fast Adam because it doesn't work
is that a turtle

try it like that
that
that makes it wavy
it makes it wavy like on the ocean
alright

I could draw around it
would that make it any easier
and you could cut on the line
that's good
