alrighty put our happy vanilla back up here
hm I wonder
out of vanilla
you know what I bet you're right
the next time we go to bread and circus we havta get some more okay
because we do use a lot of it
so we probably
thank you sweetie
you have such a good memory
oops
oh I dropped a little blob of butter
which we havta throw away
and I'll throw our butter box away
you know what we could think about
we could think about what we should have for dinner tonight
beef stew you know what it's such a warm day and beef stew it should be colder to make beef stew because it takes a long time to make and it gets the kitchen very hot
so let's think
what else could we make something xxx
yeah
hm
I could look in the freezer I think I might have some chicken in the freezer
what could we make with chicken
we could make a chicken salad maybe
a lettuce salad I love lettuce salad
I do daddy not as fond of lettuce salad
you're right
he could eat the chicken salad but not the lettuce salad right
yeah that's true
you're right
what else could we put if we make chicken salad what could we put in it
hm let's look in the fridge and see what we have that maybe we could put into our chicken salad
we could put
we don't have any celery
we can't put celery in
we have carrots
these green beans are not looking so good
I think I havta throw these away yup
um we have apples
we have some grapes
oh thank you thank you
byebye old rotten green beans
we probably have onions
we could put onions in
let's see a little tomato pesto sauce
huh you know what might be interesting actually
let me see here
I think yeah we have oh let's see what's in here
we have a little chicken tikka sauce and I wonder if we could make a vinaigrette out of this although this sauce does not excite me so much but we could probably do that right
yeah
this sauce is not so exciting
right chicken would be good
let's see
let's go look in a couple of cookbooks and see we could do I feel like we have peanut sauce a lot
so maybe we shouldn't do peanut sauce
whada you think
right
should I get the camera
no no we're still in the kitchen
oh
I'm just coming in oh no look we're in here
we're here with a bunch a cookie dough
oh and cookie dough xxx
yeah
what are you eating
let's see
alright
let's think about this
come into the kitchen with me
we'll see if we can find anything that jogs our imagination
uh
yeah that would be a good idea right
okay so for instance
um
hm sour cherry vinaigrette that's interesting huh
do you think we would like a sour cherry vinaigrette on our chicken salad
well not so sour just a cherry cherry vinaigrette do you think that would be good on our chicken salad
curry chicken salad I don't know how excited I am about that
it could be good though
curry dressing
well I don't know whada you think of curry dressing
would that be good
you put some apples and some well daddy doesn't like raisins we could put grapes
pepper
some peanuts
we don't usually have curry chicken salad that could be exciting I think right
let's see which do you think sounds better
curry chicken salad which is kind of a yellow color and we could put apples and grapes in it or do you think you would like a cherry vinaigrette
whada you think
oh I see
oh that's good to know
alright maybe we'll do that then
excuse me
goodness gracious
who's in the green room
okay
alright
here I come
ooh Fed_Ex is here
I think I know what it is it's for mommy

so honey I don't think uh you didn't wanna am I correct in assuming you don't wanna go to ballet anymore
you don't wanna go to ballet anymore
we signed up for this ballet class at the J C C with this friend of Lily's but they didn't tell and the class is all for like three year olds and stuff
and we get in the class and the and I've taken a class with her there before where you know you just sit there and the kids are doing their thing and the teacher was like and it's in like a room with the door closed
and she and no windows or anything
and she's like parents aren't allowed in
crack up
like I put her in I left I hear screaming screaming
I go back in I sit for a little bit I leave screaming screaming
buhblah buhblah buhblah buhblah
like Lily's friend said and you know they're all in little leotards and tights and everything and her friend said that she had to go to the bathroom and the woman was like you're supposed to go to the bathroom before you go to class
with three year olds
she's three
right and so she's like yes honey
you felt better when I came into the classroom
yeah
um and uh and then she like points the other three year old to the bathroom and she's like there it is
and she's got a leotard she's like I can't do it
you know I mean so
fend for yourself
exactly
it was so ridiculous
I mean it was a cute they had like a little Hawaiian dance that was really cute and stuff but
whatever
I'm not gonna pay for her to like go hysterical every week
and then like last week I was like okay we have ballet I don't wanna go
yeah
whatever
whatever
not ballet
that's what one of the dragon says on Dragon Tales
who says that
Wheezy does that right
love it
she does that with her hand too
oh
that's funny
oh that's a good idea
yes honey
what
uhhuh
well but you know what remember last time mommy's glasses broke so I don't think I want donkey to climb on my glasses
well because we don't wanna buy yet another pair of glasses I think daddy would be unhappy if mommy bought yet another pair
I seem to go through glasses rather quickly
mhm
don't hurt me donkey
oh thanks donkey
yeah
sweets you wanna read a book
book
should we read a book
wouldjou like to pick one out
alright
we could also play dominos too if you want
wow
you'd rather read Dot
well okay
hi there my name's Dot
actually I'm princess Dot next in line to be queen of the whole ant hill
of course my sister Ada's actually queen now so I'll most likely be a princess for a long time
don't get me wrong I like being a princess
but to be honest with you I'd rather play around and be a member of my blueberry troop then perform royal duties
and besides Ada's a good queen even though she worries a lot
she's a whole lot better than she used to be I'll tell you that much
when she was a queen in training she used to get upset about everything
of course there used to be a lot to get upset over
you see our ant hill used to be in a ton of trouble
there were these big mean old grasshoppers who would come to collect most of the grain we harvested every year
we were all terrified of those grasshoppers
they barely left us enough food for ourselves for the winter
poor Ada
I have_to admit she was stepping up to the throne at a bad time
now my friend Flick he's a really cool guy
he's an inventor and let me tell you he can invent anything
once he made a telescope out of a drop of water that he put inside a rolled up leaf
anyway during the last harvest we ever did for the grasshoppers Flick invented a harvesting machine
it was really neat but no one except me would listen to him and see what amazing things his machine could do
maybe if they had things would've been different
one day we heard the grasshoppers arriving so we all ran inside the ant hill Flick was left outside with his invention
I told you Flick was cool but I didn't tell you he could be kinda clumsy too
he ended up knocking the entire offering of grain over the ledge and into the river below
now we were in awfully big trouble
the grasshoppers got really mad and even picked me up and threatened to squish me
ah that's an ant's worst nightmare
ah
oh my gosh a nightmare
don't squish me
no yeah she's just a little princess ant
don't squish her
Flick felt so bad he came up with a plan to make things better
what's donkey doing
is he eating your foot
really
really
oh it looked like he was nibbling on your toe
you're right
now he has a necklace on
wow
oh it looks like a stethoscope
well
okay
he decided to leave our island to go in search of warrior bugs to protect us
no ant had ever left ant island before
good luck Flick I shouted as he flew away on a dandelion puff
nobody believed he could do it nobody expect me that is
you just watch I said
he'll get the bestest roughest bugs you've ever seen
and guess what
he did
well sort of
the only problem was that the warrior bugs Flick brought back were actually circus bugs
it was a tiny mistake but it could still work out
at least I thought it could
Flick got the circus bugs and me and my whole blueberry troop to help him with his plan
we made a giant fake bird out of leaves and twigs
so when the grasshoppers return to get their food we would scare them by crawling inside the bird and flying it right at them
it was a daring plan and Flick was great
he was like the captain of our ship
blueberries ready he asked when we were loaded inside the bird
ready we shouted back
then whoosh we were flying
and we really scared those mean old grasshoppers
they thought we were go they were going to get eaten by our bird
but then we kinduv crashed
none of us got hurt but the grasshoppers figured out what was going on
and they realized we weren't a real bird after all
but Flick was really brave he had stood up to the grasshoppers and gotten the whole colony to follow him
and Ada helped him too together they fought off the biggest meanest grasshopper of them all
in the end those mean old grasshoppers were scared away for good especially after a real live bird chased them down
in the end the only sad part was that the circus bugs had to leave
P_T_Flea owner of the circus asked Flick to join them too
sure you can't tour with us he asked
but Flick just said sorry my place is here
anyway the circus bugs all promised to come back and visit us at our little ant hill
and I sure hope they do
in the meantime I think Ada has a crush on Flick
I mean it's always been totally obvious that he had a crush on her but this is the first time I've seen her let him hold her hand and stuff
I guess if I have_to have a brother in law Flick would be my first choice
yes
hm
anyway I've gotta go now I wanna practice my flying before supper
see ya later
what happened to donkey
hm
really
nothing at all huh
