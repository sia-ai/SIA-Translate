I was talking to your Mother
Adam did you go to school this morning

why does your tummy cry
Adam what are you peeking at already
to eat
you had two lunches already
why do you want something to eat
she has two
how many do you have
ten
she didn't tell you you could look in there
oh you're not peeking
don't you peek then until you ask her
well what's the difference in looking and peeking
did you show Ursula your art gallery
that's very nice
did you show her your basket
where's the hole Adam
where's one hole
oh you mean one place to put things
no not yet
what are they
so you can turn the train around in two places
did you tell Ursula what we did Sunday Adam
what else did you do
you did nothing
oh we need to use tracks to put it together
you have_to attach it with train tracks
the train track's in the box
what
it's a support for the track
what do you think that is
you could guess
well you're close
but it's something that goes along with the train
must be a railroad crossing sign
what did you tell me
a sponge
what do you think it's for
maybe to clean the track
mhm
the other set of wheels must have come off
perhaps the wheels are down in the box
what
two weeks ago there was a little doll that was made in Italy
oh
I don't know
are they two trains or just one train
the black tracks don't belong to the same set
because most of the train tracks that are outside are black aren't they
they made them this way
oh you know how to put that together
why don't you know how
what bag dear
why do you need a bag
they have brakes just like cars have brakes for stopping
you almost stepped on your finger

I don't remember what goes first on the train
what comes first on the train
what is that
Adam you put it under that place where the track goes up look
well it could be that way
no turn it around
on the side
this way
it says stop and go
for the cars that are waiting to cross the track maybe
well yes they do
when there's a train track across a street you have_to cross part of the train track
yes
because they have a factory
well sometimes perhaps there's something wrong with the train or the track
I don't know
are you doing it very carefully
that's right
I think that doesn't go there
it's stopped
no that's plastic I think
here's a piece that isn't broken

he's working with his father
he's making something
no
look at the things you can make
what is this
what kind of house
you have_to have wood
those are nice Adam
perhaps you can get some wood and you can make a bird house
well that's not really for trees
for making small things
what will I do with that
you do
I'll let you use this
it's called a level
for being sure that things are straight
it's a drill
you can make holes with it
let me see
I think I might have something
see
see
what are you making
why don't you want to cut it
see
it really works doesn't it
no you try it
don't put your fingers down there because it's very sharp
oh yes you can
no I don't want to do it
I'm not a little boy
no I'm not
which hand do you use
a drill
makes a hole for a screw
it's a file
look at the edge and you see something like teeth and when you pull them back and forth they cut the wood
here's a nail would you like to try
be careful you don't hit your hand Adam
I'll hold it
you do it
want to try it in here
ouch
you almost caught me
why would you hold it with that
you have_to learn
take your time
alright
see
well you have_to learn how
if you had a big what
don't hit my fingers
you do it
you do
you're always turning my beater
I'll hold it while you turn
it won't move
where's the fish
oh I'm watching the fish
the fish stopped
why did he stop
you turn it dear
a t+square for making things straight
first you mark with a pencil
I guess they were Cub_Scouts
cut what
why
why
oh you can't put it back on once you've cut it off
well I can't finish it by myself
maybe you can drill a hole too
on this part
alright
turn around
no not on the floor
cut what
yes that's sharp
you'll cut your fingers
no I'm not going to do it
did you try marking with this
no
I have a blue one
why don't you write with it first
I'll hold this while you draw a straight line
but you have_to hold your pencil against there
oh well there are lots_of things that are hard to do that we have_to learn how to do
watch your fingers
don't cut your thumb Adam
oh no you cut it
well then perhaps you're not big enough to play with the tools honey
oh you're going to cut yourself
you haven't cut yourself yet
are you sure
you've got_to be careful now
hm
a wrench
screw it
no
that's right
that's the way you screw
now how can you unscrew it
if you had to unscrew how would you do it
you hurt yourself
you could drill a hole through that
I'll hold it and you turn I've seen carpenters do that have you
sometimes I watch them build houses and make furniture
use your hammer and take it out
now you can drill right through there
you can screw that on
where's your screwdriver
mhm
did you look behind you
very good
why did you knock it
did you try cutting that
you could turn it over and cut a door in it
you're sleepy aren't you
are you going to take a nap tomorrow
yes
watch your fingers Adam
pull it back and forth
what
okay
no dear
I can't use that while you're there
turn that
how can it be an old hole when you just made it
that has_to be a new hole
what do you need to open it for
there
what are you going to put in there anyway
what would you want to put
that's right
you can't
why not
are you getting a runny nose
can you pull it out now
that's a level
to see if something is straight
some water
where's your saw
you can make a door that opens
can I take a message
can you cut along here Adam
shall we do it together
that's it
there's a door
you did
a car
is that a garage
I think you have a car up there on the shelf that might just fit in there
on the top shelf
on the other side
maybe Paul took it
you what
yes
I don't think he really has it because he's upstairs sleeping
here are two little cars
one named Joe
and what's the other one's name
what was that you were doing Adam
two little birdies
how does that go
what are two little birdies

just what's on the paper is changing color
green
you take another color
I'll change
you take this
you eat yourself up
why would you want to do that
it's true
you can eat yourself if you want to
I just don't know why
I should think that's hard
you're going to eat yourself up
why are you going to do that
you can
you're telling jokes on yourself
that's what I thought
Adam are you still sleepy
you're just yawning
what made you get up so early

I'll hold this
there it is

careful so you don't hit your hand
hold it straight
what do you want Adam

what is it
I think perhaps something is missing
I think she's right
what's missing
I don't know what you'd call that
