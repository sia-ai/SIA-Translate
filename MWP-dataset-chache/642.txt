no just on the door
no dear on the door
it's easier for Mommy to keep up with with the door
let's have the door for the special place for the darts
that's the what
who makes the rodger gun
you only call it what
a rodger gun
I don't feel like reaching way up there
am I that tall
am I that tall
Mommy
Mommy
uhhuh
see
are you going to be tall enough
promise not to do it again
I still can't reach it
I'm afraid that won't be sufficient
did it
good
it's not up there by glue
no
she said no just like I said no
no
it works like a plunger
no it's not a magnet
why do you think it sticks
that's not the reason
see if you can find out why
it's not glue
it has air
I surely don't
what do you think happens when I push down
yes just like a plunger that's right
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there
maybe he could keep two
can you tell me what makes that stick
I don't talk to you like that
it wouldn't stick would it
why
the what
the dodge
what is the dodge
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun a rodger gun
I don't know that I've heard of anybody with Rodger as a last name
you didn't hit her
are you sure
what
that's his nursery school teacher
how many do you have
get on the other side honey
you get on this side Diandra
close the door Diandra
a mule
that's what the expression is
it's something you say to
yes you say it to a person to help explain something or add color to what you're saying
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target
oh is that why you missed
alright now
again

I think so
whatever you'd like to play
Old_Mac_Donald
what part of the house do you live in
upstairs
upstairs too
he says he'd sharpen scissors and knives and gives you a year's guarantee

the lowest sound
see
all the other ones should be higher than that
a racing car
where is it
oh I see
but you went away for awhile didn't you
do you want to tell me
no you didn't tell me anything about it
for the sound
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out
that shows where to put your fingers
do you think you're finished with the banjo
do you know what they are
those aren't cigarettes
that's right
I brought you that from Switzerland
you can open it this way
maybe we could do it on the table

nothing happens
I think something will happen
I think something will happen
that's right
let's make it all flat first
now fold it up
I don't think it will close if you put too many
yes
did you learn them in school
did you tell Ursula what you do at school
www
oh that's delicious
I wonder what happens if you mix these two
what do you think it will make
it will come off
you can wash it off
well don't waste the clay
look at that
it's like a rainbow
you can keep it
that was for you

why is he crying
grapes
okay
write it on something
how much do they cost you tell me
with a clock on it
how much do they cost
what time does the clock say
okay
ten cents five cents and one cent
you could just stand it up
there's a bunch of grapes
they'll last a long time
if you only give him two every day
maybe he'd like an apple too
do you
no I like this one thank_you
that's right
a what
a carrot of course
oh
you made a good one
yes just like you did
you roll it and roll it
is that right
oh yes
it's going to be a huge carrot
it's going to be a huge big carrot
yes
over there too

no I think you've seen everything
if she said yes it must be yes
I bet you need what
you do
I didn't bring one
I think you do need a string
mhm
well you can use a piece of my paper
alright
I don't have glue but I'll give you two pieces
hold it up so Adam can see how it looks
look at it
you can make it

oh
I have quite a ways to go
alright
that's not a banjo that's a guitar
Paul
oh what is it now

I don't think so
