wee perfect
we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit for the aunts and the uncles
all were assembled except Uncle Norm
who called us to say he was stuck in a storm
meanwhile my mother was getting out yams
cranberry jelly and honey baked hams
when mom wasn't looking we stuck olives on fingers
and said they were puppets and grand opera singers

while dinner was cooking we played dodgeball outside
our tummies were growling can we eat yet we cried
the timer then sounded the turkey was cooked
Mom opened the oven she sniffed and she looked
when what to our watering mouths should appear
but a marvelous bird which caused us to cheer
it's a big turkey
right
its skin oh so golden the drumstick so juicy
the stuffing was fluffy thanks to Aunt Lucy
Dad slid out the bird it weighed thirty pounds
he turned and he tripped over one of our hounds
xxx up in the air the turkey did fly
oh my gosh the turkey's flying in the air
right over the string beans
he's saying oh catch that turkey
over the string+beans and straight for a pie
my brother and I made such a clatter as we leapt and caught the bird on a platter
alright said Grandpa get on with the carving
can't you see that these people are starving
Dad spoke not a word but went straight to his work
he sliced up the turkey and turned with a jerk
in front of our house we heard beeps of a horn
a trucker delivered none other than
Norm
with a wink of his eye and a twist of his head the party can start I made it Norm said
we all took our places the food smelled so great
we started to dig in but Dad said to wait
we're thankful that everyone is together this year
in our home and our hearts where we hold you so dear

Frog ran up to the path to Toad's house
he knocked on the front door
there was no answer
Toad Toad shouted Frog wake up it's spring
xxx said a voice from inside the house
Toad Toad cried Frog the sun is shining the snow is melting wake up
I'm not here said the voice
Frog walked into the house it was dark
all the shutters were closed
Toad where are you called Frog
go away said the voice from a corner of the room
Toad was lying in
oh my gosh
he had pulled all the covers over his head
Frog pushed Toad out of bed
pushed him out of the house and on to the front porch
Toad blinked in the bright sun
help said Toad I can't see anything

I do you're right
oh you're right maybe if you kiss it it will be better
thank you very much feels better already
mhm
but I can't see anything said Toad in the bright sun
don't be silly said Frog
what you see is the clear warm light of April
and it means we can begin a whole new year together Toad
think of it said Frog we'll skip through the meadows we'll run through the woods we'll swim in the river in the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars
you can count them Frog said Toad I will be too tired I'm going back to

Toad went back into the house
he got into the bed and pulled the covers back up over his head again
but Toad cried Frog you'll miss all the fun
listen Frog said Toad how long have I been asleep
you've been asleep since November said Frog
well answered Toad a little more sleep will not hurt me
come back again and wake me up at half past May
good_night Frog
but Toad said Frog I'll be lonely until then
Toad did not answer he had fallen asleep
Frog looked at Toad's calendar
the November page was still on top
so Frog tore off November tore off December January February March xxx came to April
Frog tore off the April page too
then Frog ran back to Toad's bed
Toad wake up it's May now
what said Toad can it be May so soon

Toad looked at the calendar and the May page was on top
why it is May said Toad and climbed out of bed
then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring

Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea
Frog drank the tea and then he said tell me a story while I'm resting
alright said Toad
let me think of a story to tell you
Toad thought and thought
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
perhaps that will help me to think of a story
Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
why are you standing on your head asked Frog
I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad stood on his head for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
xxx well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
right because that could hurt your teeth
right
right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
it's true
yummy yummy yummy
that's one red tongue you have
then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
he has a headache
because he banged his head against the wall oh no
well he has a headache now he hurt his head
right
I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
would you like me to tell you a story Toad
yes said Toad if you know one
once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
a Frog and a

the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
but the toad couldn't think of a story
he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
the end
how was that Toad said Frog
but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
right

Toad put the thin button in his pocket
he was very angry

our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
Toad ran home and slammed the door
there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
oh said Toad it was here all the time
what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf

every morning as the sun peaks over the horizon a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light
this is Pride rock
home to my good friend king
who is that
that's king Mufasa
and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had come to Pride rock to celebrate the birth of their newborn cub Simba
as part of the celebration I had a special duty
I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead
then I lifted the future king up high for all to see
the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down and the zebras stamped their hoofs with happiness
what animals do you see
xxx you're right where are the monkeys
here they are and what else do you see
uhhuh
and what else
the elephants and do you remember what this is
what kind of animal is that
I think it might be a mandrill
think so
not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled life's not fair I shall never be king
who's that
that's Mufasa's brother Scar who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba he said
Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
you should have been first in line
I was first in line until that little hair ball was born he said and Scar stalked out of the cave
that's Zazu
he's a bird right
uhhuh
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
look Simba he said everything the light touches is our kingdom
Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance
what about that shadowy place
that's beyond our borders you must never go there Simba
but I thought a king can do whatever he wants
there's more to being king than getting your way all the time
everything you see exists together in a delicate balance
as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope
we're all connected in the great Circle of life
later as Simba headed back down the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride rock
my dad showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
Scar looked slyly at the young cub
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise of the northern border
well no he said I couldn't go there
oh he's right it's far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
hello
er
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on I just heard about this great place
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
they led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
Simba looked around and gasped
this is it we made it
but before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands and right now we are all in very real danger

Toma Toma

okay do you remember any of their names
why are you so what's so silly
what's so funny Banzai
Shenzi
and the always laughing Ed
Banzai grabbed Zazu by the neck and plopped him down
xxx hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
just when it looked as if it were all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with one swipe of his big paw
if you ever come near my son again he said
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
Simba peered up at his father
I was just trying to be brave like you
well their home is back in the Pride lands but right now they're just looking at the ah at the stars right
are they twinkly
sparkly
do you still have all three rings
mhm
wow nice
Dad we're pals right and we'll always be together right said Simba
Mufasa looked up at the stars
Simba let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars
great kings of the past look down on us from these stars
so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
meanwhile the hyenas received another visitor
an angry Scar showed up at their lair
I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them he said
Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared
be prepared for what Banzai laughed
for the death of the king said Scar
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
now you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly
well he has some hair on his head
mhm
aha
Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
they've just a tiny little tiny bit of hair
and ears too they have ears too right
right
hm hm hm
xxx goodness
from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
Scar appeared quickly at his side
stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
I guess he'd have_to jump
Mufasa plunged into the gourd and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him the nape of his neck and pulled him onto a nearby ledge
but suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear long live the king and let go of Mufasa
Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede
later Scar found Simba hovering over his father sobbing
it was an accident I didn't mean for it to happen
what am I going to do
run away Simba said Scar run away and never return
