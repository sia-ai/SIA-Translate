how about a little cocoa milk

uh with some whipped cream in it
cocoa milk
no cold cocoa
yes or no
okay
that
no whip creme's on the table and you can do it yourself
you can
sit down on your chair and honey you can do it
let Dad show you how to do it exactly the right way
no no no
first you first you know what we do
xxx push it
okay
first we shake it up
nope
first shake it up real hard
okay
and the press it
no
let's wait till you get the whipped creme I mean until you get until you get something to put it on
this'd be better hot
you can squirt it yourself
okay now turn it upside down
and then then you just give it a little squirt
you hold it with one hand and squirt it with the other
yeah
got the idea
now with your finger on the side you just press it from from this side press it
I don't know if there's gonna be enough in there
well okay that's all
that's all
I feel like having something with this on top
well there isn't hardly anything
I'll have some
you have ginger ale and whipped cream
oo barfie
oh
well after seeing that house that Betty last week I just never wanna be in a house like that
why
oh it's it's just too much work
too much just to think about even if she doesn't do any work on it
what's she doing
pretty messy
I guess she had about two thousand
you have one already don't you
I'll take this
here
wipe it off on this
here
no give him that one
you gotta wipe it off
okay
wipe it off
that's right
um this
she she put about three thousand dollars into this um quilting business and she hasn't made any money on it
and she uses the basement for
the whole house is like full of little projects that she's started
little rugs and things weaving
nice rugs
yeah really
not not really that great
I would say just mediocre
when she's losing money does she realize it
does she realize
well she'd like to regard as xxx
why did they bring water outside
the teachers have water to drink
do you drink it too
where do you have your snack
outside or inside
oh
I see
do they bring tables outside
or do you sit around on the steps and have your snack
oh no
I'd better get a
that's a little baby bug
just a little baby baby bug
do you really think xxx was serious about xxx
cocoa
if you wanna drink it
I don't even really want you to
no you don't mix the two
you're not you're not gonna need eat anything
find out
that's just chocolate soda
eh
I don't think it's gonna be too bad
chocolate ginger ale soda
the thing is if they're serious about leaving then they won't put a real fight to get that rent increase stopped
I think they I think they prefer not to
it's the matter of of the amount I think
yeah
yeah they h w what'd they charge for rent in nineteen seventy five was the first release that they had in a long time
I just don't know
no the inference from the letter
yeah
that
they had a ten dollar raise
when they came they were pay they were paying hundred and twenty dollars
hm this apartment was hundred and twenty dollars
no whatever apartment they was in
oh
and they had a ten dollar raise the first the first year
they had a studio a studio
yeah they had a ten dollar raise the first year
in other words every year it's been ten dollars
yeah
I feel sorry for some of these people that that are on like two hundred dollar fellowships or something
how're they gonna live
especially the ones that have three kids
yeah
you're you're sweet
oh
thing is
like everybody of course is going to join some kind of a
or sign something saying they don't wanna pay more rent
no xxx
big deal
no it's a matter it's a matter it's a matter of having some uh
legal
legal reason
yeah well you know it's that K Elliot
I would love to show him up
yeah
my my feeling is it's just given him aggravation
yeah
want me to try it
see how I like it
worth the satisfaction giving xxx
oh it's pretty good
tastes good
I like it
having provided that that there is some justification
yeah well the thing is we just can't accept it without at least putting up a fight
