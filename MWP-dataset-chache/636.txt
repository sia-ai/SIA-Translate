the duck didn't get hurt did he
oh he doesn't know where he's driving

on the car
oh yes I don't know where that is
what light
oh yes
I'm sure it must be on
you let him use that while you're driving the car
yes
I guess he was just measuring the string to see how long it was
you don't want anything in there
this is a real microscope
microscope
don't you want to look through here first
mhm
we need a small mirror
no a tiny mirror
we need something to look at
we could use a hair

I didn't bring him

let's put these up first
I don't bring water in my bag
why
I couldn't carry it
it would spill all over
yes
what did you do
no
because then you can't paint
no no he's not bothering you
he's just looking
maybe Adam would like to paint his popsicle sticks
here they all are
dip the brush in paint lots_of times so it's one color
you could do all those colors
roll it around until you get a good color
oh yes
put it back in the yellow
you get nice thick colors
