do you mean take the knot out
or untie the knot
okay
yeah see
we have_to get the bottom fixed and we're in good shape
do you think it's gonna work alright
it's almost ready
okay just a second I have_to finish this
okay let me see the knot
what are you going to do when you get all this stuff
that's a good idea
I think so
tie it to your chin
I can fix it
so it won't fall down without tying it to your chin
I don't know
we'll have_to find somebody
Jean downstairs
okay you have_to start all over
huh
okay remember
the square goes in the corner
this one goes right next_to the square
uhhuh
uhhuh I think you're right
where does it look like it should go
no
uhhuh
with the long edge you have_to get the long edges together
no that's not the long edge
here let's feel them all
this one's long
and this one's long
that's the longest one
uhhuh see Dad he did it
he sure did
do you want to try it again all by yourself this time
I'll help you just if you need help
I'd like to watch you do it all by yourself
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
and look what you've made
that's pretty clever
why of course
I have a game to play if you want to
here are some things that belong together here
the animals all chase the rabbit
yeah I've seen them run before
who's on top of my head
what's a giraffe doing on top of my head
he's finding a home
do you think he's going to live on top of my head
what am I gonna do
would he have a hard time keeping his balance
what did he say
I didn't hear what you said
Daddy was talking to me
I would say
Mister_Zookeeper a giraffe needs a home
I'd say
Mister_Jungdeman this giraffe needs a home
he likes tall trees
and then what would the giraffe say
I know what they could do
they could both get on the same boat and go back to Africa
why would he want to bite a people
he's fast
let me see where is it
yeah Daddy look Abe made a house
let me see
that's a nice house Abe
Abe I'm gonna give you some wood okay
so you can make stuff with it
here
that's red
you'd rather it was blue
well you can repaint it
you can get your watercolors and paint it
oh did you want me to get them
why don't you come put this puzzle together first if you're through playing with it
and I'll get your watercolors down
yeah I'll help
you aren't remembering how to do it
oh you're making things with the pieces
I thought you were trying to put it back together
I didn't know you were trying to make pretty designs
hey okay I put the square in the corner
and I put the large triangle up on top of the square
and I get a small triangle and put it here
I get a diamond and a triangle
thank_you thank_you
surely do you want it with your other puzzles
I'll put it over with your other puzzles so you can always remember where it is in_case you want to play with it
okay let me clear all of this stuff off
well you know you can use all the colors you like
that's what I was doing
what are you doing Abe
you're just painting
I got some free orange juice today Abe
I got some orange juice today
oh boy
what things
you know why
there it moves
I was gonna say that last time you painted there was a_lot_of water left in here
and it sort_of stuck like glue
uhhuh
well you know if you don't like that color you can put yellow or green or purple
okay
it sure did
do you like it
you want to make a puck out_of that
you need a big saw for that Abe
you need a large saw to do that
I can make you a puck at school one day
would you like that
yeah I will with your wood okay
you mean to cut it all out tonight
would you like to
I don't know
I think since it snowed so much today that they haven't been cleaned off
okay we'll work on it okay
all the big kids in the two bedrooms have pucks and you'd like to have one too
well I think we can work on that
yeah tonight
the baboon show
no I said chimpanzees
and Mommy said baboons
and Mommy was right
and I was wrong
what did you say
yeah because they aren't mean
they are mean aren't they
I thought that baboons were mean
well if they're trying to protect themselves
they do are you through watercoloring
oh you just wanted to cover up that one red spot
I thought you wanted to paint the whole block
you could paint every side different
I'll get you some new water
you're welcome
you're welcome
what are you going to do with that Abe
what are you going to do with that
yeah
you don't know yet
you just want to wait and surprise everyone
do you have any idea
where
what are you doing Abe
oh I see
so many pretty colors on that block
me too
what's it going to be Abe
oh I hate having colds
the thing I hate worse is having a sore nose
put some Mentholatum on it
it's in the bathroom
or Mycitracin it's out here
I think I'll go with the Mentholatum
I'm gonna use Mentholatum
what do you think
do you think you are a very big dinner
don't drink that water
that's really dirty
a rainbow block that's beautiful
you look like an artist
you have paint all over your body
here
maybe while we watch the baboon show we could eat some ice cream
what do you think of that
no
you could have a chocolate milk shake
what did you say
here's the other piece of wood right here
are you gonna hurry
I'm ready
I've got ta draw on it first
you want to make a puck right
how big should a puck be
okay pucks are round right
and I've got a compass
do you know why
because compasses help you draw round things
watch see
what
we don't have_to draw on the inside after we cut it out
you can paint it okay
leave them out
give it to Mommy
tell her it's all done
what's all done
they're for cutting wood
oh leave them in there
they're very very sharp
no it's a tool for big people
that's right
you leave it right there though okay
let me see how this works
are you about ready to cut this
okay we have_to cut with this right
this is really hard wood
it's really going to dull all the instruments
it's really too hard
yeah that's right
let's get you some water
she'll be so happy when you tell her
that's real neat
oh
you're getting hot
how come
when what happens
oh
well why don't we stay in here for a little while
and then we can go out and play okay
maybe
what
what kind of game could we play
oh you mean when we come back in we could play a game
now
I think they're melting
it's hard to see with all the moisture on the window
oh
play what
okay get your animals
oh say I have an idea
why don't we build something with your blocks instead
would you like that
two boxes full
okay
what
oh we sure don't
why don't you put it back in the house
what are we going to do at the grocery store
are we out_of food
oh almost I don't know what I'm gonna do if we run out_of food
I'm gonna be so hungry
oh is that the kind of food we need
what about sausage
what about potatoes
we are out
if we get some will you eat some
well you've got_to eat some potatoes before you grow up like me
didn't you know that
yeah
did you call me a dingle_turkey
you called your bunny a dingle_turkey
what did he do wrong
man was Mommy home
is that what she said
and what did lovey say
oh what happened next
oh
yeah those are number blocks huh
oh put all the numbers together and make a long train
okay why don't I make one train
and you can make another train
and we'll see which one's fastest okay
that's my bucket full of blocks
thank_you
I don't know
we'll have_to fix them
do you like them like that
you'd rather have the lenses in
what are you doing
it sure is getting long
where's the caboose
oh the orange one's the caboose
that can be a z or a n right
uhhuh
right
okay
what a nice train
I know
I'm gonna make a short train
just because I like short trains sometimes
what
are you done with your train
oh
oh what's the same as here
oh
yeah
what number
what does it look like
it could be the number one
if you have two of them next_to each_other it could be the number eleven
a guitar
how are we going to make a guitar
like what
if you're done with your train you have_to pick it up
are you done with it
okay pick it up
okay I'll help you
it sure is
that
that's a leopard or maybe a cheetah isn't it yours
maybe it's Greggy's
so does Abe_Duncan
Abe_Duncan also has lots and lots_of blocks
let's pick them all up
man let me sit down here for a minute
I got tired
putting up a train is hard work isn't it
let's not make too much noise
because Jean might get a headache okay
you can ride it now if you want to
you just have_to be careful not to make too much noise
do you want to make something with your blocks
or do you want to pick your blocks up
I'll pick these up
I wanna make some thing first
okay
alligators do
we do
go get it
go ahead you can do it
I'm not worried
hey I wouldn't color it all up
that's enough okay
yeah but that's enough
you can't get those off
that's enough
if you want to make a real alligator you have_to make it on paper
we don't want to color the blocks all up
it is
well I'm still working on my tower
yeah when I tell you to you can
no I think not
I'm not done wait until I'm done
no it's not
you know why
because I'm not gonna let it fall down I hope
I won't
boy it's getting tall
okay knock it down
oh_no Abe knocked it down
okay build something else
I won't
I think I'll make another tower
if you want to
wow you made his tail
who is
how come
you don't know why he's mean
but he is
your pencil will keep him from what
how long until I leave
oh well I'm gonna leave in a little while
and I'll be home in a few hours
Mommy'll be home before me
but I won't be gone too long
you are happy
do you want to knock this down
okay wow
you knocked another tower down
thank_you
sure go get it for me
thank_you do you want some milk
cold and hot
why do you think you're getting cold and hot
good
I wanna knock something down
let me knock it down
oh is that what I'm supposed to knock down
it's all finished now Dad
knock it down Dad
okay there
where
what were they doing
they won't
that's good
the what
maybe
I doubt it though
if they're nice they won't bite us
a zoo book
yeah
we haven't
why don't we color it then
you think you can
you hold it
hold what
I think I can handle that
that's a popsicle mold
are you going to watch me do dishes
did you play with coffee cans at school today
did you play with coffee cans at school today
what did you do with them
did you really
I have some empty coffee cans
do you think you could show me how to make a drum
okay what equipment do you need
paper what else
what
tops
and what else
you don't need glue or paste or anything
is this too large
you do need glue
okay here this is a good size
let me see if we have a top for it
boy I can really smell that bread
looking for a top to this coffee can
it apparently got lost somehow
yeah do you have everything
colors
do you need the scissors
okay what else do you need
paste or glue
okay what else
do you want this sandwich
okay show me what to do
I'd really like to learn how to make a drum
are you sure you don't color it first
okay
oh
uhhuh
now I see
that's really clever Stan
do you see how Abe's doing this
making crisscrosses show Daddy
that is good
okay what do you do with the paste
on the back
I see
say do you think that before we put the paste on we ought_to measure the paper and see if it's too long
look it's a little too long
do you want to get the scissors and cut it before we put it on
we won't be able to put it on the floor
because the paper's sticking out
and we won't be able to put the top on
because the paper will be in the way
do you think we ought_to cut it
okay let me get the scissors
okay let me cut it
and then you can put the paste on
I already did
look this paper was too long and too short see
it doesn't meet
so what we have_to do is put this here and then paste it in two places see
like that
I have_to measure it
I think at school you must have had premeasured paper
that would really make it easier
is that what happened
okay I think we're all set
okay yep it fits now
uhhuh we'll have_to wash them off when we're through
you don't think we need paste
who said that
Claudia did
or did she say that you don't need glue
oh it looks like you've done a good job putting paste on there
do you think you have enough
let's try this and see
and you do it this way
you just wrap it around
it looks almost like a roll of toilet paper doesn't it
it fit Abe
you just put it on like that
what a neat drum
it's pretty
oh that's a nice drum
are you ready for a hankie
I mean for a washrag
okay
you're getting all dirty
that's okay
I can wash the washrag
are you finished
yeah thanks for doing the table for me
did you tell Daddy we played with clay today
what did you do when you played with clay
a bone
what kind of bone
oh
what did Mommy make

on what
a new creation peanut butter and yogurt popsicle sandwich
did you tell Dad about the long snake we made
I did
what did you do with it

Abe look what I got for you

come over here I'll help you
a long sleeved shirt
right over there
are you going to play hockey with that
you're doing just fine
come here and I'll help you if you want some help
Abe I'm sure they're both out there
it's over there somewhere
you're going to have_to start remembering where you put your toys when you're done playing with them
where is it
it's right over there
go give this to Mommy
just what I needed
thank_you
okay
no that's right
it goes in here
there you go

Abe I can't find your hockeystick
last night
try out in the hall
Mommy was right here it is
good shot
right through the goal
Abe are you through with your yogurt popsicle

it still tastes the same when it's melting
do you want to finish it Stan
let me see how much is left
oh I don't want it thank_you
anyway Abe give it to Mom
you are going to play golf now
okay I'll make a little cup
you made it a hole in one
try it again
good one
a hole in one
okay you missed that time
you found a bat that you made
oh that's my bat
what's it doing on the floor
yeah
the balloon you made me
I took it to school and I hung it on the wall okay
uhhuh
you sure did
good I'm glad you like it
a quiet golf ball
is that one loud
you mean like a tennis ball
you want a quiet tennis ball
oh that is really quiet
be careful with your stick now
don't hit the tv
wait what were you doing
oops there it is
have you ever played golf before
do you play golf at school at all
did I tackle you
okay there you go
where are you going Abe
oh
sure there you go
what are you doing Abe
they did
we can fix it if you want to
what are you doing Abe
I thought you were going to do something
it's right here see
no I didn't see it's right here
we can fix it
I got a splinter
yeah she took it out with a needle
yeah
can I put this right here
that's right
oh I know
I'll rip it and put it right here
not the gun
that's pretty nifty having a tag on your old gun here
oh I know
I was just using old in a different sense
what
wow
can I help ya
I think so
come here and I'll help you
you know what Abe
you left your cowboy hat at school
oh that one
do you know where it is
oh I think that's Amara's that's out there
yours is in here somewhere
okay you can go out and look for it
oh did you find it
is that yours
it doesn't have Abe written on the back of it
I'm pretty sure that it's Amara's
what do you think
there's a rag on the floor
you can use it
right behind you
does that look like your hat Abe
hm
that looks pretty fine
tell me about it
use what
a piece of what
we could put a piece of wood on here
how come
why do we want a piece of wood on here
to make it stronger
I think I have something that might make it stronger
I have a dowel that might work
just a second
okay I'm trying to find something to fix it
here I have something
this
look it's exactly like this
except it's a little thinner
see this will fit on it just perfectly if we saw it
I have_to measure it to see how long it is
can I see your carving tools Stan
sure
sure
do you know what these are called
carving tools
because you can use them to carve wood
and that's what we're going to do carve this wood so_that it's the right length
be careful
Terry cut herself with her carving tools
did you know that
Terry in Texas remember
sometimes she isn't very careful
Abe we don't want you to get cut
let Mommy do that okay
you can use these when you get to be seven years old
no I'm twenty four
that's a_lot older than seven
look at Daddy
no he's twenty three
do you want me to cut it
maybe
yeah just a second
I'll let you use it
if you're real careful it won't
it's still sharp though
yeah let me get a ring going all the way around
that way we can break it instead of sawing all the way through
okay your turn
what
oh do you want me to help you
sawing is pretty hard work
okay let me try it
I think we'll just try and break it
those are Abe see how pointed they are
do you want to try it
does Daddy
uhhuh
Abe bring the box over here you can help me okay
hold this
hold it real tight
are you holding it
huh
a ring
what would a ring do
he means a ring around the wood
so_that you can break it instead of sawing it all the way through
oh I see
I won't
I'm doing my best okay
are you holding it for me
you have_to hold it tight
we did it
he sure to sand it down
I will
where's the gun at
do you want to put the wood like this here
we sure could
I already did
we need what
we need a thing that could work
what
is that good enough do you think
how am I supposed to do it
I'm supposed to do what
Abe don't you think it's good just like this
well what do you want
you want it to end right here
so you want me to cut this part off
do you still want this part right here
which part don't you want
show me
touch everything you want me to cut off
what
Abe do you want me to help you for a while
Ann I'll do it
Abe show me what you want
one that's just that long
where do you want it
on this side
okay I can do that
not now I have_to use it
we can't cut that one
because you always run around the house looking for your long stick
so we're not going to cut it
come here
why don't we paint a gun
do you want water colors or felt tipped markers
okay
okay
I sure will
okay ow
Abe you're going to have_to put your trucks away
I'm sorry too
I should have looked where I was walking
I didn't break the skin
thanks for being concerned
you'd make a good doctor
would you make a good doctor
did you tell Daddy what you and Cherry and Amara were playing today
playing what
dying
Cherry died
and they put her on the sled and took her to the doctor
oh did she get better
that's good
tell Daddy when she got better
that one's smooth that's right
a long gun
and that's called a rifle
you can paint that and put your name on it
and then we'll put tape all around it okay
uhhuh
what's your idea
that would be a good idea
and what could we take to roast on the campfire
marshmallows
what else
uhhuh your heel protects your foot
that's how come it's nice to wear shoes
uhhuh are you going to paint your rifle
there it's not stuck now
oh I'll be small when you grow up
oh sometimes I'm little and you're big
yeah
it's too difficult
what type of paints
do you want to use your felt tipped markers
they're right there in that box
these scissors are as big as your arm almost
mine are just a little bit longer
you think that your arm is the same size as mine
let's see
nope mine are longer
oh but look mine's bent too
three year old boys do have pretty long arms though
oh
really
I guess it depends on how you define almost huh
you're closer now than you were a year ago
you're closer to seventeen than you are thirty five
okay
okay slowly but surely your colors are all disappearing
because nobody ever puts them back in the box
oh
I like it
it's really colorful
that little dot
hey do you want to call Grandpa and
if you go eat some spaghetti
because I'd like to read it to you
but I want you to eat some spaghetti first
well just go eat a little bit
see how much you can eat
you do like it
good
you can
you sure did
that was a hard climb
I'm really proud of you
let me watch you
what Abe
a wheel
what
I don't think so
oh this pen is the same as your pen
they're the same color aren't they
uhhuh they are a little different
Sesame_Street
why do you think it says that
good
Abe do you know what that's called
a Peadinger swinger
a Peadinger swinger can you say that
it's broken
it's broken
I have_to fix it
because all the strings got screwed up
what
oh you can balance yourself right there
what
what's it a picture of
looks like a unicorn to me
Abe remember yesterday you were pretending you were a unicorn
show Daddy how you did that
they do
what do they have
you could pretend you have a little beard
if you want to pretend that you're a unicorn why don't you get a kleenex and wipe your nose
it's running
you got what
what did you get from your book
for me
good
how nice thank_you
okay I will in just a little while
what are you doing Abe
from what
who gave it to you
who gave it to you
Susan
where
where does she live
what was it Abe
what was it you were looking for
another magazine
it would probably be in the bookcase and not in your rack
over there where all your books are
what
a hole's in your pants
let me see those are new pants do you know why there's a hole there
because your zipper is down
tell me what you're looking for
maybe I can help you find it
what does it look like
thank_you Abe I'll save it for later okay
what are you making
what is it going to be
oh are you going to go lasso a cow
I went outside to look for your rope today Abe
and I just couldn't see it
I couldn't find it anywhere
Abe's mother is
well on Wednesday I'm going to come and pick you up
will that make you happy
good
oh I don't know where that is
do you want to show Daddy this
what a nice flag
I'm just looking for a recipe
because I was gonna make some brown sugar brownies
so we could eat them tonight
do you really think Lovey would like some
who would
your teddybear
your what
would you like to
okay why don't you come over here and get it
a piece of candy
what are you making Abe
oh
who are you going to surprise
good
you're pretty lucky Dad
because Abe made you a surprise at school today too
oh boy
he just didn't have time to make me one
what
you left one of your sticks out in the hallway
did you find it
why don't you close the door
I could give it to little Sarah
do you think that she'd like it
can you put the top back on the pen if you're done with it
okay
that's what
oh do you still like it
is Todd mean
what's he do that's so mean
and that makes him mean
he's a mean cowboy
is he your friend
is he your friend
when you sort_of go
what do you mean
sort_of
oh that makes you happy
is he Cowboy x
oh are you Mean_Bart
okay
okay
that's a good idea
so you want to tape it
there
that's good because it looks like a flag
hurrah with it hurrah with it
oh
we saw flags like that when we went to Six_Flags
and we saw flags like that when we went to the football game
and they had a parade
where else did we see flags
we went someplace that had a_lot_of flags
Six_Flags
I could
why do I want to cut them out
well what part am I going to cut out
tell me if I'm doing it right
now what do I do
like that
Abe did you ever tell Mommy what you think with
remember

no I wish they did
we can buy you some liners if you want some
real special
for what
I had that sucker
but you didn't eat your spaghetti
so you don't get it
what
it did
too bad
we could
like your Sesame_Street poster
I am too
let's go
let me finish doing the dishes first
and then we can
hey you know what
I don't know what you did today
what did you do today
did you have a good time
oh I love cupcakes
do you like cupcakes
do you know what I have
I think I might have a surprise for you
I don't know
can you guess
look at what it is
it's a sucker
how long until I go to school
I'm not gonna go until seven thirty or seven forty five okay
down to Tom's
we'll have_to see if you're tired
I'll put you to bed if you're not tired
I'll take you to Tom's
you don't think you're not tired
oh you mean that you're not tired
oh does that mean that you're not tired
oh I wasn't sure what you meant
did you have a good time when they were here
oh what
when I wasn't here
oh I'm sure glad that I came home then
I don't like it when Abe's lonely
what else did you do today
you don't know
you didn't go outside
you just ate lunch
and then what happened
nothing
you mean you didn't do anything at all all day long
gee that must have been real boring
what's that
let me see what that is
part of your watch
I think you're right
where is your watch
you don't think it did
then what is this
I think that it is part of your watch
we'll have_to look for it
it's not
good I hope you're right
is that another piece
we'll have_to find the rest and put it all together soon
your watch
it wasn't
