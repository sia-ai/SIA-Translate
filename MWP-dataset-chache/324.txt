or a chimney
oh yeah we don't wanna cover it right because smokes gotta come out
hello Sammy
you don't want him what
batting at it oh okay
I know
alright I'll make my own though I'll make my own little thing right here okay
do you remember what we made before this morning when we were building blocks
what did I make before
well what did I make this morning that looked like this
a swimming pool yeah
here comes a big meat eater dinosaur
he could if he was that big he could push all the water out
those dinosaurs were pretty big
I'm going to put this on the dinosaur's head
if I make a swimming pool I don't want it to be knocked over by a meat eater
I wanna be able to go swimming in it
I do
because why
oh is he coming
okay let me make my pool very fast
I'm gonna make a big big big swimming pool
did you ever go swimming before Matty
at where
at my work
who would take you to go swimming there
um hm
what did you and daddy do there
have we gone in a long time
Matty what are you doing
do not bite your toes
aren't we playing here
come here
I thought the meat eater was coming to the swimming pool
no no but this is my swimming pool
what's he gonna do to my swimming pool
no how will I get water back into it
put some more water into it well okay
oh no my swimming pool is destroyed
he's way over here waiting he wants me to build it again
Matthew I had asked you to not bite your nails
do you want me to put the medicine on them again
what
you're just pulling them
watching
oh it looks like Ryan is building something too though
I'm building a bridge
cool
but I remember there's a story about a bridge
do you remember that Matty
what's the story
remember it goes who's that trampling over my bridge
do you remember that story
what's the name of that story
remember who was it that would go over the bridge
the goats
and who was underneath the bridge
yep
yep
so what happened at the end
they got rid of him yeah that's right
here's my pool again
get ready to join my swimming pool
this is me swimming in my pool
oh no my bridge
oh no Ryan's bridge got destroyed too
that is a ferocious meat eater
uh huh
do you want to build something
that's all you have your task that's all your task okay
okay well I'll build and you be the meat eater
but I was wondering if you remember what we might do after Christmas a place we might go visit
Matty why are you not listening to me
I'm gonna get the medicine
I have_to you keep biting your nails
oh it is
well thank you
I'm gonna bring it down
if you keep biting your nails it's going on
I know that nail is bothering you right now but we can't have you biting your nails so much
you what
I xxx I'm still building
do you remember where we are going after Christmas
Niagara on the Lake no probably not
but where are we going to go do you remember
it's where Stuart Little lives
um hm
New York City
yep
and what are we gonna do in New York City do you remember
visit where do you remember
oh it's that big thing coming
it is the meat eater
oh no
here comes the meat eater again
oh no
oh my
hey Matty when your grandma and grandpa were over did you guys eat a big big dinner
you did
what was the name of that dinner
the Harvest Dinner
what did you eat
chicken you ate chicken
and what else
you know what one time when I was little I went to Niagara Falls too
and you know what I remember seeing was a great big something with water
a waterfall
did you see that waterfall too
yeah
what was it like
what was it doing
flowing down
was the waterfall making a big splash at the bottom
what are you guys doing
I don't know if we are gonna play this game
I don't really like it just building and having my things destroyed
oh Ryan doesn't mind
well Ryan can build then
I would like to play a different kind of game because it's kinda boring to build and then to get destroyed
you wanna write on the board
Matty was just telling me about the Harvest that they had
oh yeah the Harvest Dinner cool
so it's all ready for the roof
I was actually though gonna send this picture to grandma
maybe I'll take out the picture
because there's a picture of you in here
you're in there
yeah
let me see
oh that is your picture
okay you wanna keep it in here then
but later at another time I'll probably bring it to work and copy it so that grandma can see it
but what if I get another one and you can have one and then I can also send one to grandma
she likes to see pictures of you
that's what I was thinking yeah you can have that one and we can get grandma a new one
what were you doing in that picture
hm let's see
what were you doing
I couldn't hear you what
spraying people
I don't know it doesn't look like that to me
looks like you were on a swing
let's put all of these away
because I don't know you're just kinda being aggressive with them
Mommy does not like aggressive games
do they have swings at your daycare
right inside
no
oh they're outside
so is your daycare outside
it's outside the whole building
wouldn't that be silly if you guys had to take your naps in the snow
oh no
yes you did
sleep on the sidewalks if they're shoveled you mean
maybe
do you want to play with your garage or play with your barn thing
oh my
what is that noise
you wanna play with with what with this
I'm not sure where the keys are for those
do you know
are they locked
all locked
what goes in there
oh cars
I'm not sure where the keys are but I'm sure we'll find them later
you wanna play with this
what happened
what happened to your toe
tell me what happened to your toe
oh no
uh oh
hey you know another thing that has been happening since we haven't seen Ryan is that you've had to go to the not the hospital but the
yes
how come
oh yeah
what do you do at the doctors
huh do you remember what happens when you go to the doctor
you kind of forget
how come
why should we give it to a baby
is it falling apart
yeah
do you wanna play with cars on it now though before we give it to a baby
no
yeah no
well let's see what happens at the doctor I'm trying to remember it too
we went to the doctor and does he look at you and say bugga_bugga_bugga
he does
he does
what'd he check
he checked to see if you say bugga_bugga_bugga
well let's see if this one fits
does it fit
oh my that doesn't seem so good
he flipped over huh
who's that driving that car
I don't know either
he keeps flipping over
tell him cookie monster be very careful
uh there he goes
oh he did it
he listened to you
what happens when we do the ball
whoa that goes far
what
oh you wanna do the ball again
you wanna see that one again
you think he's gonna flip over this time
no
so what did the doctor say when you went to the doctor
what did he say when you went
I don't remember him knocking over stuff
but I did find a car cool
uh oh he just stopped
I don't know
oh thank you
what were you gonna tell me
is that from Star Wars no
it's just a race car
I don't know what it's from though
it's very old
have you seen that movie Star Wars
yeah
you have it
what's your favorite part of Star Wars
do you remember
what would be your favorite part of the whole movies all the movies
I know what part is your favorite part
you used to watch it over and over and over again
what was the part that you always wanted to watch again
something with Luke
with his arm cut off
what happens how's he get his arm cut off
what does Darth Vader tell Luke
yeah I have not seen that movie
I am the father
is that is that what he says
I am your father
what does Luke say
and then Darth Vader says join me together
and we will what
and we'll rule the galaxy
and what does Luke say
that used to be your favorite part and you'd say never
I'll never join you remember that
yeah I'll never join you
are there any other parts in Star Wars that you like
what part is that
I don't remember that
I don't remember that part either Sammy
hey grandpa did something I was thinking about the past grandpa did something silly with Sesame do you remember
what did grandpa try to do with Sesame while he was visiting
what'd he do
what was he gonna do
and then what was he gonna do with that
what was he gonna do with the picture
make it into a puzzle
yeah
that would be neat
anybody need some gas
here we go
just you
nobody else is allowed to get gas
how come
but what if I need gas to drive home
you can just go to another gas place
okay but what if I don't have enough gas to get to that one
oh okay okay
that's pretty nice
thank you
so if he really really needs gas then he can come to yours
how about me
oh thank you that's nice
in fact I can't make my car go at all
could I come
I'll bring my bucket
can I have some gas in my bucket and then I can go back and fill up the car
thank you
now I can go super fast
what is that you're chewing on
a thing to cook
well this is kind of interesting it has a couple of different parts to it
what's this part for
okay and then there's another part too
oh this is my favorite part what's this for
I need some gas for my lantern
actually some of them do run on something called kerosene but this one looks like it runs on batteries
where can we go with this what is this for
camping
I can't hear you honey
for hiking or camping that sounds like a good idea
didn't you and daddy go hiking last weekend
do I have any gas
oh you filled up my car remember
I might need a little
can I have a little bit for my car
oh thank you so much
now I can get home
that's good
I drove in my car
but he was almost out of gas
yep and I need to put it in so I can get back
are you trapped are you trapped
what's that for
for you to sit on
interesting
does it work
is it gonna break
it looks like it might
oh good
now what are these for
is this like glasses or something
what are you supposed to do with them
okay
you do put it on there
but where's the rest
I'm not sure either
we threw a lot of stuff everywhere today trying to pick up
but you're right that's what goes in there
and you can make what
what can you make out of all these
a stink house
oh remember that book you were reading with daddy in the car
that was such a funny name of a story
it was the stinky
cheese man
the stinky cheese man
I couldn't believe that name
do you remember what happens in that story
oh they scream
why do they scream
they did not know his name was stinky cheese man
hey is there anybody in there
I don't know knock knock
is anybody home
I thought I heard someone cheeping in there
is anybody home
I'm gonna open the door I'm gonna unlock it
hello are you home
what're you doing
goodbye
but but I came to see if you wanted to go to the beach with me
no
what are you going to do today if you are not going to the beach with me
you're reading
so let's see where could this be plugged in
oh wait let me turn off this
what do we have this for Matty
do you remember why we put that why we started using this humidifier
because he was getting dried out yes
oh okay
if you want sure
he can walk around
should we take him out
okay
really
in the cage he just looks what Matty
oh I see he doesn't change much when you take him
but why do you think Ryan might want to see him
what would be the good thing about taking him out of the cage
oh I see
I do think he is very cute
yep that's true because we could compare them right
should we compare them to see how big he is in real life versus on the puzzle
where is that puzzle
let's see here so what do you think about him here versus in the puzzle
yeah he's quite a bit smaller
but he kind of looks cuter
another thing that's interesting what else do you see that looks different
if we take it out of the bag you might be able to notice something that I was noticing
what do you think about the color of him in here versus right there where he's walking
he looks a little different as the one right there yeah
I think he looks more yellow in real life
what do you think
you want to do the puzzle right now
well okay we'll watch your tortoise to make sure he doesn't crawl around too much
what's wrong with those
they're stuck together
I think because it's a new new puzzle
isn't it new
they just made it and we just opened it
now this is going to be a tricky puzzle I think because look at this
what about the colors on all these pieces
what do you think about the colors
they're not the same as that one but they're all the same as each other
see like is this part of the tortoise
is this part of the tortoise
a lot of the pieces look the same this is going to be a tricky puzzle
which way should we do it should we do it facing you
should we try to do it that way
do you see any pieces that might go on the top
see that's another problem we don't have a picture to follow do we
so I'm wondering we haven't seen Ryan since before Christmas time
that was quit a while ago wasn't it
so what did you get for Christmas
you'll show us
okay
what is that
a leap pad
well what does a leap pad do
can you show Ryan what it does
I have not seen one of those before
look at that
yeah
so it has all kinds of stuff
so what does it do besides read
what do you think
okay so this does all kinds of stuff
it can do stuff like read it can play games
oh wow
what's this story about
oh I turned it off
what's this story about do you remember
do you remember what happens to this girl
what else did you get for your birthday
goodbye we can play it later Boo
what else did you get for your oh not birthday did you hear me say your birthday
was it for your birthday
wow how do you work that
oh yeah that is very interesting
what do you do with it
oh is it on
I don't know Boo what'd you think
what could be going wrong with it honey
oh you know what remember daddy says that sometimes sometimes the batteries will get loose
do you think that's what's going on
it's still not working though
what do you think is wrong with it Matty
well anyway what's it supposed to do
oh it's supposed to make sounds
like so every time like if you were to hit that it would make a sound
wow let me see that
so what did you do on Christmas
tell me a little about that
yes we did have a tea set party
what else did we do on Christmas
oh well what is that
but but what do we do when there's no M and M's
okay
do you have some
you know you did get a_lot for Christmas
was it fun was Christmas day a lot of fun
yeah
so I don't know if Ryan remembers from when he was small about what happens on Christmas Eve
what did we do for Santa who was coming to our house
and what else did we leave him
did he eat the cookies that you left him
he did
he was probably very happy that you left him something to eat
yeah and where does he live
why does he get hungry
okay now we can see how this works
oh my gosh
that is interesting
so let's see should we get some for Ryan and then he can have some too
maybe he needs to see how you do it again
how do you do it again
interesting
I'm gonna try one then
I'll take a green one
so how does Santa get to your house then
okay
now what is the interesting thing that happens with Santa and time
yeah why does he have_to change back the time
why do you think he needs a lot of time
to get to everybody's house
yep
nope I think that's enough you probably had snack at school
we just had to take some M and M's out so we could learn how to use this again
so you know what I don't think Ryan knows about the play you were in
you were in a play
at your church
and what was your part in the play
were you little baby Jesus
what did you have_to do
you were a little sheep
for the play he had to turn them on and off
and what was my job
so what were the things we said in the play
did we talk a whole bunch or were we mostly just standing in the play
yeah it was just a couple stuff
well you had special things that you had to say that I could not say
what were you supposed to say when you were walking up
right and then we sang a song too
oh are some of them still stuck in there
here let's try let's try pushing them out
oh there the rest of them come
so you did sing a song
he did so good
you knew almost all the words right
remember what song it was
away in a manger
do you remember how it goes
do you remember any parts of it
good job you do remember that
you know another thing we did since we saw Ryan is we went to Toronto
do you remember what we did in Toronto
oh that sounds good
well that's pretty neat
what's that for Matty
yeah what do you use that for
in the car it took a long time
I didn't even know there was stuff in there
what's in there
oh nothing in there right now
uh oh is your hand stuck in there
are you okay
let's take it out
who are those people on the front there
Sully okay
and Boo okay
and Mike okay
yep oh you're right there's nothing in there right now
but what did we do besides get this when we were at Toronto
what was another place that we went
where did we see something very very interesting that was very big and a little bit scary
the dinosaur museum
were there any meat eaters at the dinosaur museum
you know maybe you could tell Ryan about those stories he might not know those videos actually
oh good so you're gonna show them to him and also tell him about them great
let's see The Big Freeze no I haven't
Spirit no but I heard that that was a very good movie
yeah
what do they do in that movie
interesting
well tell him about this one
do they
well what happens why is it called The Big Freeze
what happens in that movie
it gets very cold what did they do
why did they go on a journey in that movie in The Big Freeze movie
why did they go on a little trip remember
now who's Spike
how come they had to find him did he get lost or something
now who's that little guy
yeah but I don't know his name
I don't think they give him a name
okay so Spike is the one they had to go and try to find
okay
and did they find him
well that's good
oh what happens in The Land Before Time
this is a great video it's Matty's new favorite
what happens in that story
because Ryan does not even know why they were traveling
yeah
well it's the great what
they're traveling to the great
the great valley
why do they have_to travel to the great valley
did they go with their mommies and daddies
no just them right
did that guy go with them too
well did he try to get them then
what's this thing that thing
oh because I had not seen one of those before
you do
they're pretty cool
what happens what comes out of volcanos
what are you looking for over there
hey did you get this for Christmas too
this big thing right here
no
you wanna bring it out here
hey that's a pretty neat book huh
it pops up like that
do you know any of these guy's names
do you know that guy's name
no
there is someone who has a funny name though
remember the bird what do they call him
Terry Dactyl that's a pretty funny name huh
that's a pretty neat bird though
oh
yeah what are pterodactyl's kind of like they're a kind of what
that's pretty neat
yeah it's a very interesting very interesting book
I don't want to wake him up so do we have_to be quiet
I'm gonna turn the page I don't want him to wake up
oh that one kind of scared me a little bit
who was that guy
do you remember why why does Trixie do a good job in that book
what does Trixie do that's helpful
um hm she finds the little one's mommy you're right
you got a_lot of books over there
so I'm trying to think of what else have we been doing
I kind of like elephants
you too
blue
yeah
hey I was thinking about the game we played yesterday that was very fun
remember I'll give you a hint and then you can tell Ryan what game it was
remember there was an owl and an elephant in the game
remember what were we pretending
you don't remember the game
the owl remember I had the owl first
and then I got the elephant second
you don't remember that game
no the cat game we played later
yeah remember we were pretending that we were cats hiding and who were we hiding from
the poachers yes
the poachers you gotta watch out for them
well why do you have_to watch out for poachers
you know why what do poachers do
they grab people
yeah it's usually animals
they don't grab people usually
Elisiah's secret yes
now that's a funny part
I bet Ryan does not know what Elisiah's secret is
what is her secret
she can
what does she tell them
she does
wow
so what happens when she tells here secret
it comes and takes her powers away
but how does she get her powers back
oh Shamomambomo
yeah
well why does he give her back here powers
well what does she do that she does a great job with at the end
remember she saves something
she saves the elephants yeah which Ryan would like because he said he likes elephants
he would probably be very happy to see that
well he could see it right
what is the movie
oh just a new one okay
it's still in the movie theaters yeah
he doesn't know that name of it
what's the name of it do you know
the wild
oh I did hear about that movie but I have not seen it yet
we did something actually very interesting on Friday
we went to a what kind of game
remember what kind of game we went to
a hockey game
wow
that was so fun
um hm
do you dive in there
you and daddy dive in the diving part
oh that's what I was thinking because I didn't know if you knew how to dive or not
you do go under water and I do too yes
we actually went swimming in Toronto too didn't we
did I go swimming though
just in the hot tub right
you and daddy went swimming in the big pool
so where was your hockey game at that you went to
at the college too
oh for Christmas
well there's one thing that we could show Ryan that you did get from grandma Sharon and grandpa Dale
Ryan will probably find this very interesting cause you know he probably does not know how to play this game
oh well I'm just gonna do good things then
do you get to pick if you do good things or bad things
how does it get decided whether you are gonna go up the ladder or down the chute
so she's gotta slide all the way down there
what happens to this is the one that we keep landing on what happens to this boy
and he broke the ice
yep that wasn't very safe the sign said no skating
well why do you think they did not want him to skate there
because he'd go down the chute
I like this one we like to try and get this one
what does he do to that cat
the cat loves him right
you wanted to help a bunny if the bunny was hurt
yeah that's right that would be nice
oh but what is this boy doing with the cat
oh no
right there he gets scratched by the cat
do you think the cat likes having his tail pulled
no probably not
the cat was probably angry but you're right where does this boy get scratched
yeah in lots_of places
this is mommy's because this one's kind of funny
what's this girl doing
a headache
you think her head hurts
yeah maybe her head would hurt too
how's your headache you had a headache this morning
yeah what was he doing that he should not do there
he's not putting his boots on yep
that is a good one
what one
well what are those
you don't like them
you don't like beans
I don't really like them either
daddy probably would eat the beans though
I would eat the beans too
whoa that is healthy
now let's look at this last one and then maybe we can do something different
yep so how do you actually play the game
if we were here we can't actually play the game because it would take too long but if we start here what do you want to try and do to be the winner
and where do you want to try to be at the top here huh
yep you go up
so we've played this game a couple of times
who's usually the winner
yep sometimes you would win sometimes I would win sometimes daddy would win
it was fun I like that game
oh is that part of your puzzle
okay I put your puzzle right there and we will work on it later
that's going to be tricky so we'll probably have_to have daddy help us okay
yep
oh okay sure go ahead
oh well maybe we could have a pretend tea party
oh I like tea parties
you wanna bring over your tea set
oh so do we need all the plates then
how many did we get
I do think it's cool
how does it work
oh yeah
oh that's interesting it can go on there even
oh look at that
um hm
you did
did you like it
on tv
yeah I don't either
they have movies and they have just the show honey
we never saw the whole movie
a magazine
cool
so they have a magazine see I did not see that
very interesting
yeah you were showing me that
I think that's really neat
oh wow
oh look at the front of that one
oh that's pretty neat
is that a little bear
okay
ink pad okay
oh
what do you think we should play today
do you want to put together your big puzzle
remember we were working on that the other day
do you want to do that
I put it away when I cleaned your room up but we can show Ryan because he never saw you do that
oh which one
which one's the broken one
oh I think it's missing from this puzzle too
oh it's this one right
oh
yeah can we still use the puzzle though
how do you how do you put this puzzle together anyway
what should we do first
A okay
an A
you'll have_to point it out to me
that's an A
okay
for apple you're right
so where's the B one
huh this is the B one then
what're you supposed to do with that
oh yeah
good job
okay and now what comes next
well that's kind of far away honey
how about over here because you want to have it be for when you're talking on the tape recorder okay
and if we're too far away you won't be able to hear
or how about right here
okay where's our C then
well this is so you can look at them all
is this a C
oh
how about this one
oh how about this one
how about this one
so C is for what
yeah
do you like carrots
yeah
I do too
yeah
lettuce
yep
we didn't think that he would like it but then what did you do
see
so what would come next
A B C
what's D
which one's D
is this it
how about this one
how about this one
no
C
or is it
yes the one you need isn't it
now how are we gonna put this in here
that's a broken piece
well how do you think we should do it
oh is that gonna work
it works but you have_to be careful
alrighty so where's that one
hum think that goes in there next
what about that one there
it doesn't fit
yeah
oh which one's E
oh you found it
oh where did we see these guys
yeah
do you remember going to the zoo
what was something that one time when you were going to the zoo who do you usually go to the zoo with
usually with your daddy
yeah
do they have a_lot of animals
yeah I like elephants
they're pretty big huh
okay
oh you found that one fast
alright
do you know what a G looks like
I think Ryan might be able to help you
I think it's by Ryan
does that kinda look like a G maybe
yeah
do you know what those are on there
G is for what
yep
grapes are pretty good
do you eat grapes sometimes at school
sometimes for snack
do you eat them
yep
sometimes it depends on if you feel like it or not
and what comes next
good job H
H oh H where are you
we miss you so much
where's H
H
hm where could H be
how about
H
H is for hat
there you go
so let's see
Q
oh yeah
H
what comes after H
oh my gosh should we find I
oh look look look
one of my favorites
do you remember when we got ice cream in Toronto
oh yeah
did you have a fun time
that is a pretty neat suitcase
do you put all your clothes in there
sometimes
when do you think you could use that again
yeah
go get what
go get the map for North Dakota
oh because you want to show that you might use that when we go to North Dakota
it's pretty far from here
yeah
do you know anybody who was born in North Dakota
that is so funny that you were born in North Dakota
wow
I didn't know that
that's pretty neat
do you remember what you used to do in North Dakota
anything about remembering about North Dakota
be a baby
yes you were you were a baby
so you could probably guess that maybe you cried like babies do right
and you probably drank milk in North Dakota right
oh you want to show him something else
do you wanna do that instead
he hasn't seen that
you can show him that
the magnet set
oh you got a magnet set
he might not even know what magnets do actually
no
do you want to show him magnets and show him what they can do
no

what are things that you can do with magnets Matty

cool
I really like magnets a_lot
do you remember one time when we first got your magnets and we walked all around the house and then we tried to see what the magnets would stick to
do you remember
what would the magnets stick on
oh just stay here
you can't remember where
let me see on the fridge
yep you're right on the fridge that's where they work
is there anywhere in here that they could stick to
is it working
you're sure that would stick
let's see
nope
metal
oh it's gotta be metal
is there any metal things in this room
what do you think could be metal
could be
is it working
no
how about
glass
but glass is not metal though glass is something separate
that's why it's not sticking to the glass
sometimes cars or trucks can be metal
you wanna see if one of your toy cars can do it
okay
where're your toy cars

anything else in there that that might stick to
does that red thing on that car
