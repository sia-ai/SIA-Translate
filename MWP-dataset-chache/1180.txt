yesterday we went on a class trip to the museum of natural history
we were very excited
Gaspard and Lisa please try to stay out of trouble our teacher said as we got on the bus
on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits that we should see
Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us
the museum was very interesting our teacher showed us everything
butterflies monkey tigers elephants and even the skeleton of a whale
but the exhibit of extinct animals was the most exciting
Gaspard and
oh those are some extinct animals
Gaspard and Lisa
those are extinct animals which means they lived a very long time ago
mhm
it looks like Gaspard and Lisa doesn't it
yeah
that's right
Gaspard and Lisa our classmates joked you look like extinct animals
the museum may want to keep you forever
everyone laughed except for Lisa and me but it gave me an idea
Lisa let's play a joke on our classmates I said and I told her my plan
first we made two little signs and then we crept under the bars
we put the signs in front of us and froze like statues
I had forgotten to take off my scarf but our classmates didn't notice
some of them even took pictures of us
lots_of pictures
our plan worked perfectly
so perfectly that our class left without us
the lights went out and the door closed oh no
we were locked in the museum
what's to become of us Lisa cried
don't be afraid I answered we'll find something to eat we'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll leave
but the only thing to eat were dinosaur bones and in the dark they were sort of scary
it was terrible being locked in the dark suddenly the dinosaurs started growling
ah we shouted help
but it wasn't the dinosaur it was the guard's dog who came to rescue us
our teacher and classmates were happy to see us and boy were we happy to see them
yeah
okay
let's put this one back
hey
yikes
yikes
wow oh really wow
Nemo loved everything about school
he loved swimming there everyday with his dad
he loved his classmates he loved his teachers and he loved to learn
and he really loved field trips
even though on his very first trip he was fish_napped by a scuba diving dentist and brought to an office aquarium in Sydney
but that's another story
every morning Nemo's dad Marlin would take him to school
along the way Nemo always liked to ask his dad lots_of questions
what's a whale's tongue like
how many clown+fish can a shark eat in one gulp
why are we called clown+fish asked Nemo
we're not funny at all
Nemo saw his best friends Tadpole and Sheldon they loved to play tag and algae in the middle before school started
Mr Ray was on school yard duty that morning he was everyone's favorite teacher
Nemo and his friends had a special song they made up just for him
he's our favorite teacher hip hip hooray
before the big spotted manta we love Mr Ray
then it was time for school to begin the first class of the day was music taught by
Senor Seaweed
Nemo and his classmates were getting ready for the spring concert
Nemo played the conch shell Sheldon played the clams Tad strummed along on some kelp and Pearl played sand+dollar tambourines
Mr Ray taught science
today's lesson was your ocean home
Mr Ray called on Nemo where do you live Nemo
anemone I mean anemone
I mean
where does Nemo live
an anemone that's right
while the rest of us would be hurt by its stings Nemo brushes himself against the anemone every day
I guess Tad lives in the ocean
hm really I think just clown+fish live in an anemone
yup
hm that's interesting
then it was lunchtime
there were lots_of lunchroom rules
no inking in the lunch area
mhm
uhoh
yes I think that Tad Nemo and Sheldon are boys and Pearl is a girl
yeah
mhm
I think so yeah
mhm
which blue and green fish
oh
I think that is a boy
yeah
Nemo took out his lunch
I'll trade you my kelp sandwich for your algae pizza he said to Tad
yum said Tad
mhm
yeah
that's right
after lunch was recess yay
everyone had fun playing hide and seek but then Sandy Plankton got in a bit of trouble
it's like my dad always says says Nemo it's all fun and games until someone gets stuck in a giant clam
oh no
such a big big clam
once Sandy was free it was time for Nemo's next class
it turned out there was a guest teacher that day
Dory
hi Elmo she said waving to Nemo
Elmo isn't Nemo
Nemo's not Elmo
you're right
mhm
xxx no
that's right
Dory was teaching the class how to speak whale
repeat after me she instructed
that's good whale
what did you say the class asked eagerly
I just said hello said Dory
then it was show and tell time Pearl brought in a cool piece of coral she had found and Sheldon the seahorse had some big news
his dad was having babies
who wants to go next asked Mr Hermit
um oh Mr Hermit the crab see there's his little claws behind everyone
these are his eyes
see
today I have some very special visitors for you all to meet
come in guys
Anchor Bruce and Chum swam in
pleased ta meet ya said Chum
don't worry kids we don't eat fish anymore well we try not to anyway
after a quick question
uh Chum said that
I think so
that's right
after a brief question and answer period the sharks left everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief
all too soon it was time to go home
the students filled into the schoolyard to wait for their parents to pick them up
Nemo couldn't wait to see his dad and tell him all the fun things that had happened
they sand the rest of the Mr Ray song as they waited
he's our science teacher we think he's swell
sometimes we act goofy but he never does yell
aw shucks said Mr Ray looking pleased
soon Nemo's dad arrived how was your day today he asked Nemo as they swam home
dad it was awesome Nemo cried Sandy got stuck in a clam Dory taught whale I brought in the sharks for show and tell
I can't wait till tomorrow
Marlin shook his head sadly I'm sorry Nemo I can't let you go to school tomorrow because
it's Saturday
you don't go to school on Saturday
you go to school Tuesday and Thursday
that's when you go to school
that's right
