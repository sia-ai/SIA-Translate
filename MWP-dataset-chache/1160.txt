Corduroy
is Corduroy a little bear
what's he wearing
is he wearing overalls
yes
what color are they
xxx oh
late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
xxx a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
I'm going to help with our wash
Corduroy waited patiently then he suddenly perked up his ears
Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
pockets said Corduroy to himself
I don't have a pocket
he slid off the chair
I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash+cloths but nothing was the right size or color
then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
this must be a cave he said sighing happily
I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
you can come back tomorrow she said
I'm sure he will still be here
as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag a very bad Corduroy had discovered
before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
into the dryer
but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
poor Corduroy was damp all over
the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
it seems to me he should have his name someplace
he's too fine a fellow to be lost
as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
began his search again
he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
what is it
maybe it's snow he said
I've always wanted to play in the snow
he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
it's soap
gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
what fun he said with a smile
I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
this must be a cage he said
I've never wanted to live inside a cage
but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
oh he's sleeping
next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
I left something here yesterday she said
may I look around
certainly said the manager
my customers are always leaving things
Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
when he
when she heard the manager call her
is this whatchor looking for senorita
xxx yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
it's time I took you home
Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
why did you wander away she said
I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
that's his little pocket
I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
that's some thread
that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
wow
that's great
well you want Mommy to pick it out
oh you wanna pick it out
okay
you have_to carry your box
you want me to hold your milk
okay
what would be a good book to read

animals should definitely not wear clothing
animals should definitely not wear clothing because it would be disastrous for a
porcupine
look his quills are sticking right through his shirt
oh_goodness
because a camel might wear it in the wrong place
what's he wearing on his humps
hats where should he be wearing the hats
that's right
because a snake would lose it xxx
he's losing his pants
oh my xxx he needs to put his pants on
because a mouse could get lost in a hat
oh my gosh
because a sheep might find it terribly hot
oh that sheep is sweating he's so hot
he's panting
I'm so hot
because it could be very messy for a pig
that's right and he's his carrots fell onto his tie
because it might make life hard for a hen
a hen is another word for a chicken
yeah
oh my gosh he laid her egg in her pants
it's stuck in her pants now
whoops
whoopsie
because a kangaroo would find it quite unnecessary
kangaroo already has a pocket I don't think the kangaroo needs another one
I think it's a baby kangaroo
that's right the mommy
because a giraffe might look sort of silly
oh my gosh that's silly
and just one
like Daddy
yeah
because a billy+goat would eat it for lunch
oh my gosh that billy+goat is eating his own pants
isn't that very silly
yes that is so silly
because
oh my gosh it fell down
because it would always be wet on a walrus
he went swimming and his clothes got all wet
because a moose could never manage
he got his antlers stuck in his suspenders
oh my gosh
because possums might wear it upside down by mistake
xxx because possums like to hang upside down
but most of all because it might be very embarrassing
the elephant is wearing the same dress as the woman
haha that is so silly
hm hm hm hm
