that makes sense
but right now we're in the play room right
we're not in our music room
we're in the play room
what do you wanna play with
okay
I wanna listen
okay
I'll I'll tell it with you but you have_to start it because I don't know what story you wanna tell
what story do you think you'd like to tell
okay how does it go
how does it go
okay
you can't press the buttons on it while we're making the tape because then it'll stop the tape from working
but you were gonna tell me a story I wanna hear it I wanna hear it
well you have_to make up the story
we'll listen to it after
how does it go
once upon a time
okay
once upon a time there was a
this isn't a this isn't a tape that makes a story happen
we don't listen to it
we're gonna make we're gonna tell it a story and then later we can listen to it after it makes a tape of us
so once upon a time there was a
what
you don't know what story you wanna tell
okay
there was a girl named
and she had
right
now those stepsisters and the stepmother were they nice to Cinderella
do you think they were nice to Cinderella
no
what what was wrong with them
what did they do
they made her do her chores
and what were her chores
you don't remember
hey don't you have Cinderella
where is Cinderella
she's over there isn't she
go get her
okay
so when she would do her chores what would she have_to do
would she have_to clean things
okay
how did that go
oh that sounds like something that happened when the fairy godmother came around right
and they weren't gonna let her go where
they weren't gonna let her go to the
the ball
and who was at the ball waiting to meet meet everybody
that's right
so if the stepsisters and the stepmother weren't gonna let Cinderella go meet the prince how was she gonna get to the ball
well who came by
her earrings
she gave her earrings
and she gave her the pretty dress
how'd she do it
what was the magic words
Boo
wow
and she got the pretty dress and what else did she get on her feet
okay so then what'd she do
oh and who'd she meet there
what did they do all night
they danced and danced and danced right
but what did the fairy godmother tell her
she had to be home by when
when did she have_to be home
remember
she had to be home before
so the clock started to ring and it was twelve midnight and what did she have_to do
did she have_to get home
how'd she do it
uhoh
that's when she lost something right
wow
ooh you need a tissue
wanna blow
okay
well she l walked down the stairs and she lost her slipper and she went back home but who found the slipper
all the way home right
oh that sound's just the it's just the dryer working
so when the prince found the the shoe the glass slipper the next day what did he go do
that he didn't know right
he didn't know her name so he went to find the lady
now isn't that silly
isn't it silly that the prince danced with Cinderella all night lo long and he didn't ask her her name
what a silly guy
now he's got a problem right
all he's got is a shoe
he doesn't know her name
boy oh boy
mhm
mhm
I know she's lovely
yeah
mhm
I don't have a Cinderella dress for you sweetie
oh her nice mommy not her stepmother
yeah
Cinderella's kinda like the kind of girl who needs a nicer mommy right
did the prince ever find Cinderella
let me see
let me see
let me see
looks like a little smudge
you're talking about
so did the prince ever find Cinderella
it's a little smudge
well you know
she cleans everything all the time
she probably got a little dirty
when we're done telling the story I'll try and find a cloth to wipe her off
so did the prince ever find Cinderella with the sh the glass slippers
yeah
and what happened when they did
when they found each other
and they lived
the end
that's the end of the story right
you did a good story telling
you did a good story telling
you know
that was lovely
there's still some more tape

wanna make one up that you just make up
you're so good at them
oh what is that
this is this is called a um
what are these called
well if it was round we would call it a a snow globe or a water globe but it's a square so it's not a globe
a globe are round things but this is a it's a special little water
sparkles
what are those shapes
you don't know what shapes those are
yes you do
what shapes are those
yeah

sometimes b wings get broken but we can fix them
we can fix them
here
there you go
now you just you should rest a little while
how you feeling
how are the wings

but Cinderella has friends
Jacques and Gus
and Cinderella's stepsisters are cruel
Cinderella's fairy godmother makes her a beautiful dress for the ball

and then it pulls hands
hm
but what is it what is it really

I can't I can't pull
I can't pull

it's a big rope isn't it
oh no
now I got it
now I got it
whoa

where's your doggie
what about right there
oh I think it they went back

but wanna play with the little one
wanna play with the little one
wanna see what's in the toybox
go see what's in the toybox
just take it's just like your hamper cutie
there you go
slow and steady
what are you finding
what are you finding
oh it's that book
which book is that
to learn about a skeleton
and what else does it teach
yep that's a book that has all the different body parts right
well let's look at it and see what we know
okay
that's not the first page though
what's that
that's a little girl and what are all these people
yeah
I guess that's like her whole family right
okay well that is her insides
those are her that's her tummy right there
that's a he
that's a boy and that's a girl
that's a tummy and those are her intestines
and what else are there
there's what else does she have
well let's look at all the things things
she's got
what are these
what are those two things
well what does she see with
what does she see with
her eyes
what does she hear with
what does she what does she taste with
what's this
you don't know what this is
it's her
what does she talk with
oh Jilly you know
her mm
her mouth
I don't know
does is she saying something
what do you think she's saying
what do you think he's saying
no Jilly this isn't the type of book that has a story it's the type of book that that we ask questions and then you answer them
what does she have right there
it's her heart
that's right
and those are her
do you remember this
this you might not remember
she breathes with those
those are her lungs
you know what these are
kidneys
kidneys
that's right
she goes peeps
mhm
no
no
her poops come out of her intestines not her kidneys
those are her lungs and that's what she breathes inside her air
what's that
and what's a skeleton made of
sure you do
like all the dinosaurs
yes bones
what is she doing here
what about here
what's going on in that picture
oh she's wearing something here
who do you think those belong to
it belongs to grownups
those are grownup shoes
I don't think he's mad but he seems to be smelling something he doesn't like
what is he smelling
sure you do
I know that you'd like me to just read the story Jilly to you but this is not a story that just gets read
this is a story that asks questions so that the so that the children can answer them
that's inside his head
it's his brain
yeah do you know what he uses his brain for
to think
hm
I think they're just sticking out their tongue
no
I think it kinda shows that if your brain wants you to do something you can do it
so if you think really hard I wanna stick out my tongue you can do it right
see what your brain can do
what if your brain says I want to wiggle my fingers
can you do that
yep
what else is in the toybox
why don't you go check
mhm
whatcha getting
oh that's a good puzzle
I popped them out
what number is that
what is it
Jillian you're not playing very nicely
every time I ask a question you say you don't know
but I know that you know all the answers
it's numbers
mhm
well it's not number five because that's right here
it's upside down
looks like a one to me
where does it go
I've never seen anybody use numbers for ears before
they're numbers
yep
well one's a six and one's a nine
can you guess which one's which
well you turn them both one way and they're nines
turn them both that way and they're
sixes
but you turn one one way and the other one the another way and one's a six and the other one is a
what number's that
so whatcha doing
what's what's the oops
the puzzle pieces won't stay in
why not
oh it's a very hard puzzle
maybe it needs to go the other way
right there
very good
what color is that
well you gotta find its home
you gotta find its home
nice
which
very
very good
very good
now you got one last piece but where did it go
where did you put the one last piece
