they do
does that happen very often
are very many kids bad
and who else

you don't have_to have it if you don't want it
I want juice
okay it's coming up boys
I had a nibble of that
have you ever said that before
why not
why don't we call her now
what do you mean a map
oh you mean a shovel
very good Ross
and you go all around
that's home base
great
that makes it more interesting doesn't it
good
why do you need fresh air
oh really
why do you feel like
do you know what it's called
it's a saucer
do you feel like you're going to throw up
here we go right
Ross is listening to Abbott and Costello and he came and he said
so what did they do to him
did they take him away they're not going to hurt him
good
good
Abbott said he might still drink on the dead man and then the the sheriff said
why did you gun by him
gun him down
yeah
yeah
and then he said
I think I just dropped a bottle on my head
I don't understand do you understand
the other the next the second one that was funny there was Abbott sitting in the park
he said
I ams
they said
who cares
and he said
I do
when he shot the dead man
no he wished that everybody didn't think he did
okay now you're missing good jokes
whose idea was it really
Ross's
think so
did you have anything to say
why did you call
please don't rip it
okay go ahead and do it to see if I care
was it right was you did
what do yo mean how should you have known
you should use your head and think if it was a good idea
brain
daddies always tease their boys
sure
at school or at home
hey Daddy tell them about this and tell them that I gave it to you too
where do you want me to put these up on my door
right on your door
okay I'll take them to work and tell them that my son made them them for me okay
what are we going to do next
I don't know
maybe some reading
we haven't done reading for a long time
let me think
we could try to learn work on a book
okay
put some of this over here
what is that that's a little pelican
a Mina bird
my turn now
I'm going to go like this
I can
what
ready
I said
those are Rossy's
you keep Rossy's and you keep mine
I've got_to jump you now
oh very bad boy
yeah very sneaky
no you can't do that Ross
after you jump you move and you have_to jump again if you want want to move again
you just jump over him and that's it
that's all you can do you can't go any further
because that's the way to play it
that's next turn
you do that next turn
but you won't have a next turn because I'm going to cheat and jump you
I'm not going to cheat but I'm going to be sneaky
watch this
one jump two jumps see
there's a sneaky way to get me
I'm not going to tell you
no you can't do that
that's not a a possible move
you can't move backwards until you're a queen
a King
yeah right okay go ahead
I'm not going to give you any help
they're kings and queens
want me to give you a little help
you can put this guy here
you're kind of trapped right
you're trapped
yeah if you moved him up here then that would be bad move
you you have_to leave him there so it blocks me
I'm sad because no one brought me a present
yeah
is that right Ross
Marky that's not fair
what does that mean
doesn't he say bomit
yeah he says bomit
Ross you just make your daddy's life hard you know
gee Ross I've got a_lot_of work to do
do you know what I mean
is that pretending
no that's not pretending
what were you you pretending
I see
then he fell down for real by accident
yeah and it was an accident
it was an accident
Mark
what Mommy what
are there six more shows
the third eye
five and six more shows
no wait
how many more shows
that's not right
how many have they had so far
and how many are left
right
and what are there names
number
good
how many
ha ha ha
he said there are two more left
oh
jump Mark jump
Ross
don't push him don't push him
are there six shows
in all
how many in all
that's what I didn't want you to do
ow
I didn't push you
Ross do you know how to put the Under_Roo's away
yeah just drop them in the right place
did you do a good job on it Ross
okay
do you want to have any tapes
yeah
but I might leave anyway
so what are we going to do have tapes or not
how come
okay good
Marky has_to have him first
well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will will find it
where Mommy and Daddy can't find it
well how are you going to remember in the morning where it is
what do you mean
Ross let's talk about whether you should give Sean the sword
now why don't you want this
to be friends with another boy
you what
but um okay I understand what you are saying
but then how is Sean going to feel
well think about how you feel when other people have you ever ever been a kid and they don't play with you
other kids won't play with you
how does that feel
you don't feel too bad in that situation
just find another kid to play with
and then don't you need more that one kid to play with
what if no one with play with you
no one at all
what if your brother won't play with you
brothers always play huh
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play
that's smart Ross
he's a smart+alec isn't he
so you think Sean should've done that because no one was being being nice to him he should've just left
that's a good idea
so you don't ever want to be nice to Sean huh
how come
well how about Grandma
are you ever going to be nice to her
she pokes you
she doesn't always poke you
she likes you Ross
grandma really likes you
she buys things presents for your birthday
what if she promised not to do that anymore
what if we got Grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then
no but what if she really stopped it
no wait Ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her
but you're going to get old someday too
well how old is your mommy
because you should learn how old your mommy is that's how you you should know
your mommy's thirty eight
when you write on the the Mothers Day present for her and on her birthday present you have_to to know how old she is
okay
are you going to be mean to old people
just because Grandma is old are you going to be mean to her
think about it
you have your own body
kind of but sometimes you have_to think about other people like like Sean and Grandma and
no one makes you and you shouldn't yell
because people I'll tell you the reason
do you remember about about God
do you remember God
okay God wanted people to be nice to each_other
you don't believe in God
okay well then what makes you want to be nice to other people
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you
and you wouldn't have any more friends
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids
think about it
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody
let's think about a world where everyone is nice
I'm not bossing you
I'm asking you to use your head
you don't want to think about other people huh
you don't think about being nice to other children
well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids
okay I'll tell you the rules
do you want me to tell you the rules
then I should tell you beforehand
okay every time you go to a party with kids
listen let me tell the whole rules
I'll tell you the whole deal
whenever you go to a party with kids you have_to be nice to all the kids
when you go to school you have_to be nice to all the kids at school
and when you go on a picnic and a Boy Scout party you have_to be be nice to all those kids to and you'll have_to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the Mall you have_to be nice to everybody
Ross that's not nice to your father
your father's heart is going to break Ross
yes
that's it and there'll be no more Father for you
well then you'll be nasty to her and her heart will break
but they're too old and you don't love them
well but if you don't love them if you want to just be nice to me I'm not really old and I don't poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so I wouldn't die
you do
but you didn't want to talk about my things I was talking about
it's not with your body
Ross it's not your body you're doing things
because you have a good little heart
you want to really listen to the answer
wait a second
wait
it means that there is an answer to your question
are you ready to listen to the answer
in your heart you know right here where your heart is
you're not listening
right in here is your heart
if you have a good lovely chocolate heart then you want to be be good to other people
if you have a mean hexy heart sketzy heart
do you know what what sketzies were like
then you want to be mean to other people
are you a sketzy
yeah
why
the Grogg in Raggedy Ann
now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then you'll go and you'll help him
you don't have a warm nice heart
you don't to be a friend of brothers
see I know you love brothers
okay no more talking about it
I'm not going to boss you ever again
I'm finished bossing
I know you have good warm heart and you'll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore
so that's the end of my bossing you
really
that's a dirty trick
are you going to try to do things so_that they'll make me mad
no okay
no that's not the dirty trick that's not the deal
the deal is that I just stop bossing you and you do the good things for yourself
hey Daddy xxx
yeah he's short and ugly
isn't he ugly
he's the ugliest of all those guys
he looks like a mer+man
mer+man

what is this thing at his feet
Ross said he has short legs and I said he doesn't have short legs
it's only when his legs are pushed up
Ross you sound like you have a cold
do you have a little cold
how should you know
because you know how you feel
you know how your body feels
you can't feel your body
you must be really sick then
boys that can't feel their body must be real sick right Mom
because what will I say
ask me my name first
how should I know
how did you know that
oh
no because you knew I was tricking you
why do you want me to ask you
okay what's your name
you tricked me
okay now you ask me what my name is I won't trick you
I won't trick you
ask me again and I'll tell you the same
ask me again and I'll tell you the same

Mark they're in the Toyota
the real ones are in the Toyota and the big ones are out
oh the big ones are out here
now the the big ones are in the drawer
are you going to leave it on
I hope so too
what do you mean
there's not more you have_to take
there's no more you have_to bring
no bouncing on the bed
if I see anybody bouncing what will I do
I don't want to go to school
daddy I know how to open my door now
I'm not going to drive
I'm not going to kill myself
what did you say Marky
I don't know
you said I'm going to push the button down or something
no
I'm not going to drive I said
do you know how to drive
Ross tell Mommy the whole background to this about how there's there's a friend of yours who thinks there is Fire_Bird and all those
and Flier_Bird
okay who's this friend Ross
who are you talking about
hold on a second
Barry Barry
is Barry in your grade
okay you sit here and tell me the whole story
you don't want to to do it lying around
okay
now what do you think Barry what happens with Barry
what did you figure out
and I said Maybe it's true
maybe there is a commercial
and you said May be
maybe what
the third one
what is the third one Ross
the third set
okay what are the first two sets of He_man
what what are the other sets of He_man
what set is this Ross
yeah you already said Battle_Cat
okay and what's the other the second bunch
what does it mean in_between
how do you know that it's in_between
how do you know that it's in_between
why isn't he
why isn't he in the first bunch
why isn't he in the first bunch
why isn't Fakir in the first bunch
Fakir
yeah why isn't Fakir in the first bunch
he came out when did he come out
uhhuh
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch
he's the last one of the first bunch
but where do you see him
where do they and when they make ads where do they put Fakir
they don't add him anymore
and what is the third bunch
and what is the third bunch
but don't you think that Zoar might be Flier_Bird
what does Zoar do
what would he be
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch
what are they
supposing I didn't know about them
oh you don't me to tell you you don't want me to tell
but you know something
Ross that you didn't figure out
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back did Fakir ever get in those
are you sure
is Fakir in the second bunch
so they never put Fakir in any of the bunches
yeah the did
you made a mistake Ross
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak Fakir into into those pictures
yup they did
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that
how would that prove it
where are we going to find that
you mean at the toy store
I know how you can tell
the toys have numbers
issue numbers
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers
you can compare the numbers
but the interesting thing is that Ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why I just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy Barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys
I'm sure that there will be a third wave
you mean roots
an orchid
isn't he a terrible little brother
why isn't he as bad as I think he is
but he does understand some things
I do understand
do you understand Mark
yes
he does understand
what does he not understand
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things
no it makes two infinities and eight
and that is an unreal number
that's a fantasy number
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number
because you could never really get there in reality
in reality you can get to infinity
right because you'd have_to live forever
yes
so it's fantasy
infinity is fantasy
good_night
good night Mom
what was the hardest part of your day
okay what was the hardest part of your day
come on in Mark
can we take our backs
sure
after you come back then you'll go to the movies
let's take the other car other car because we might need to to carry big things
it's Ark
it's a boat
it's a good question right Ross
okay now ready to come in
and we can't take the toys
no but can take your belts off
do you do good jobs
what's the best job to have
but is there anything interesting about it Ross
yeah Ross I did
they were messing up the car
I sure hope Todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it
if they do we'll have_to tell them about the exciting part they missed
one of the guys disappeared just like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz
who
oh really
how about Marian
Marian didn't do it
you go one two three four five six seven eight
you you count that way
people would get very confused if you went that way
it wouldn't work out well
you could make it up too if you want
do they still check you for lice at preschool
Ross was pretending he's a servant he said
at your servants
at your servants my King
instead of at your service right
which one is it
at your servants or at your service
at your servants my King
the real word is service
no why Ross
from your service my King
right
that's cute Ross
what is a servant
what does a servant do
kind of like a slave
but a nice one huh
and the king's not mean to him right
and what else
we're the kings
we're the kings up here and you're our little servant
I'm the one that
you can't have any blankets servant
okay you can have a little blanket servant
if you're good
there okay
we're the the kings right
but I'm the one that has glasses
what happened here
maybe it felled
good Marky good
he really is doing well isn't he
when you were a little boy three years old there were were some things you could do better than what Marky can do now
like you could tell long stories about Star Wars
no and why is that
and when do you think they're going to stop
okay and how about when Return of the Jedi is finished
I see
but then we won't have any more toys
we'll have more toys we'll have as many toys as you want
Mark
you can have as many toys as you want
isn't that true Ross
Ross you mean advertise
but you don't want the baby why didn't they have babies Ross
they didn't grow them
why
did they stay inside
what did it say
did you read it
what Ross
what about it
I understand
then how did you see it
oh yeah
what does it tell you
yes
which bears Ross
yes
are they just the same size and everything
how can it drink milk
I see
and are they the same color as the Mommies
how come
I see
you mean in Mommy's tummy
real inside where there was blood
that's nice
and that's where they came when they were babies
right
is that where they grew
well then did the Care Bears grow their babies
inside them
but you said they didn't get fat
oh
I see
neat huh
so they can't have any babies on the show huh
where did you get the name for the little bear
on the back of the box
and the name of the bear is what
skyscraper
trust him
my_goodness
that is quite involved
they call skyscrapers skyscrapers because you know how big skyscrapers are
wasn't that a joke about Little John
is it the same kind of joke
do you think it's a funny joke
what if I called you He_Man
it would be a joke
it would just sort of be a because you're not really a huge muscle+man yet
what if I called you Darth Vader
but what if I said that I was just playing a game would it be funny then
but it would be like fantasy then
it's hard to tell the difference between humor and fantasy
up in your weapons drawer
no I'll do it for you
we can call the Weapon Drawer the Small Pieces Drawer
how about that
let's get our covers up right
covers
covee covers
I'm not feeling very good am I
