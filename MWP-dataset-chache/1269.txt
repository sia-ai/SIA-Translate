wait to catch the ripe plums on their pointed spines
when their spines are loaded they run back to their den
there to feed there to feast
there to slurp and when
all the plums are safely stowed away in tummies
and seven porcupines have said seven yummy yummies
one by one they rattle out of their earthly den
to stand beneath the plum trees catching plums again
whatta this remind you of
who else does that

this one a banana slug
don't take a banana if you picnic in the jungle
for it's in the deepest jungles that banana slugs are found
and if while you are sheltering beneath palm or banyan tree
you put your peeled banana down beside you on the ground
you might miss make a mistake
when you pick up the peeled fruit to chew
and take a careless chomp from a banana slug instead
and if you do it's true to say the taste will never go away
and even if you suck a mint
or chew peanutty bread
or lick a lolly scrub your teeth
swill onion soup or bite a peach
or try to rinse your sluggy mouth with fruit juice from a jug
your gummy gums will never let your taste buds or your tongue forget
the savor the full flavor of a fresh banana slug
see all those banana slugs

this about moon frog
the moon slid down the sky the froggy whispered soon
if only it comes close enough I'll leap unto the moon
the moon slid lower still
the froggy paused then hop
his long legs launched him at the moon and landed him on top
the moon sailed smoothly on
along its starry course
with froggy proudly riding like a jockey on a horse
he rides the moon
did you ever see a froggy who ride on the moon
you don't like that one
why not

octopus
okay
when Ozzie octopus is sad
an easy thing to be when you are cold and lonely
at the bottom of the sea
when Ozzie octopus is glum

and soon starts laughing happily
and shaking just like jelly
with all his eight legs tickling his octopusy belly
