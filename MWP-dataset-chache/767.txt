they look like bulls to me too
remember the bull on Greatgrandma's farm
remember when we went out it the woods to look for strawberries
remember how the bull pawed the ground and looked real mean at us

that's Grandpa's book
you can read it if you want to though
do you want to find pictures of cows
here are some cows
