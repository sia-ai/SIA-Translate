okay what's this book called
Franklin
rides a bike
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing
but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels
in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
we're going on a picnic said Bear come on
Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
aw that's kinda sad isn't it
yeah
what's xxx wearing
a helmet and
a backpack right
right
that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right
yeah
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered
and he fell into the
oh no
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
what are they on here
a bridge
that's Rabbit's bike
that uh is Bear's bike
xxx uh oh oh my gosh Honey you're absolutely right
you're right
you know what the purple one must be Fox's
right oh my gosh you're good
I didn't even realize
right
you're right and the blue one's Bear's because Bear is big right
right
right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
xxx Franklin sat on his bike
it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
he felt very unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got_to the third rung she fell into the sand below
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we xxx
then you fell
but I caught you right you didn't really fall
Franklin remembered when Beaver when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
it's easy said Franklin just do it
Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
I think she's swimming underwater
are you gonna swim underwater one day
yeah
with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
he couldn't hit the ball at all
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
xxx he's playing baseball
like Daddy's team right
well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
xxx he wants Fox to do well right
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
that would be great
right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
Franklin put on
padding
he lined the walk with old pillows
I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
Franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
way to go cheered his mother
Franklin was thrilled
finally he was riding his bike all by himself
I can do it he shouted
Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
look at me he called
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
not everything is as easy as it looks
sure
sure do you want Frog and Toad

at our house my mom baked three kinds of pies
pecan and pumpkin and apple surprise
mm Daddy likes pecan pie

at night we were nestled all snug in our beds
while visions of turkey legs danced in our heads
and the very next morning Thanksgiving yippee we got up and watched the parade on tv
are you gonna watch the parade with Matthew this year on tv
relatives arrived from near and far
by taxi and airplane by train and by car
my brother came up the basement stairs lugging the kids' table and folding chairs
we counted and polished our best silverware
well you mean the little turkey
I think that's her hand
and then that's the napkin and then that's a little turkey napkin ring
right she's gonna put it down next to the plate right
yeah
we counted and polished our best silverware
and set the two tables with patience and care
the turkey went in and as more cousins came I laughed and I shouted and I called them by name
hi Danny hi Donny hi Paula and Vicky
hi Casey hi Kathy hi Brenda and Ricky
