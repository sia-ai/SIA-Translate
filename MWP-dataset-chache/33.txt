or or monsters
why do so many people every night what
well that's because there's the there's the parkway over there and they wanna make sure the people can ride on it see the parkway over there that's those big lights
another reason is so_that people can make sure that they can move around in their rooms
and Mrs
Scott has hers on because she's afraid of robbers
that's about all the reasons there are
yeah that's it
yep and now we can see the little dipper do you wanna see the little dipper

to Hungary
do they just keep on changing like that
that would work pretty well wouldn't it

you could send one of the daddies to when its time for me to teach classes and things at school you could send the the other Daddy down
I'd just stay home and play with you
I'd get fired you're right
that wouldn't work out too well
