uhuh
uhuh
how many cars were there
uhuh
broken on both sides of the car
mhm
it was really ruined
uhuh
this was something and we were we weren't really talking about cars but Marky was yeah I think yeah said something about cars and I said broken old cars
but the use of
speaking of cars
wasn't quite right because I wasn't I didn't continue to speak of anything else about cars
we had just finished talking about that particular car
what do you think of this place Mark
now Mark
oh Ross what did you say then
Ross said a funny thing you know that
we forgot to tell the tape+recorder
remember about I asked you whether daddy was
I asked your daddy whether your daddy was mean and you said not just fair mean
remember you said
when there's a purpose
I'm only mean when there's a purpose
is that really true
mhm
yeah
fifty nine times
where does he hit you
Mark
is it true
is that true Ross
Ross is that true
I want to hear what those nasty words are
tell me what the nasty word is
yeah
it's this stereotype kid who is driving me crazy
he's started like he hit me back
yeah
hit me back
that's how he started
it started
you know when this fight started
when Marky and Ross came into the family
that's when the fight started
before there was Mark and Ross there was no fight
mommy and daddy lived in peace and quiet and love
then came Mark and Ross
and first one hit the other and the other hit the other and the baby and the alligator
now when you knew when you knew Mark was coming and you were already saying dirty words
peace peace and quiet honey not piece of quiet
peace of mind
no
yeah
no we didn't that's right
okay
so
stop it first
okay Mark
if Janos says stop it you have_to say stop it right now
put your feet back right now
I'm going to drop you off the cliff
I'm going to drop you off the cliff
not a joke when we're traveling
we can't do xxx
don't take it as a joke
Ross don't you dare play
eyes straight ahead like little soldiers
straight ahead
okay
you see that big forest out there
you see that big forest
you see that big forest out there
do you know what kind of big animals are out in that forest
okay Ross
I can see you now Ross in my mirror
I can watch what you're doing Ross
I can see you in the mirror now
look
if we have an accident and then it's because_of you Ross
how are you going to feel
you want that to happen
and what do you do now
hm
look around and see everything what we didn't see during this life time
right
that's right
that's a good answer
well you'll see it actually a couple of more times because we'll go back up and you'll go down again
any way I was telling Agi on um the fourth of July they have a big celebration
uhhuh
in in Washington D_C
it's a big deal
so it's actually pretty good time to go
we don't want to hear anything about Feetman
because if you tell us about Feetman then we're going to have_to hear about Armman
why not
maybe we need an armman
I see
never playing Barr and just only playing Feetman
I see
why did I let him do that
that's no fun
that's not fun to do it all by your self
you played Feetman a lot
let's make Feetman and Barr get together
how about
okay let's make a new game
okay
it's called Feetman Barrman
why couldn't do it together
Ross
why not
you're not answering me
you refuse to answer or refuse to play Feetman and Barrman
why
we'll come back and see it
yeah
that's sort of fair
just a year huh
it doesn't seem right
three years you played Barr with Marky
you have
he wouldn't
I think that Mark it's time for you to play Barr some times
okay

oh you're not going to have babys
okay
what are you going to do
you're both going to have a job

but I got a better idea
here let me figure out a way
you get a big house
really big house okay
then Marky has got a girl friend and they're going to have some babys and you have a girl friend they're going to have some babys and then when you go on picnics you'll have about eight kids and a couple wives and it'll be a huge big family
private marriage
it's not as it's not going to be as fun
you in your wedding
comes
okay
you don't have_to have a big wedding
no
you can have a private wedding
a private wedding
yeah
yeah
you can get a girls that don't like to kiss much
yeah
some girls don't like to kiss
what for
you're going to you know what
you're going to change your mind
you're going to he's going to change his mind isn't he Mark
you're not going to get married either
you're going to find when you get older that you think girls are really cute
you should see
you're going to be chasing all around after those girls
you bet
yeah
no
nuhhuh
you just wait and see
not like William though huh
chasing girls
no
you want to wave hi to mamma
don't you guys love your mommy

Celia is nice
Celia is a nice kid
and Madeleine's cute
and you can't marry them you know that
because you can't marry your cousin
you can't marry your cousins
they wont let you
what
the rule book wont let you
that's right
it's against the law
that's right
it's mostly against the law to marry almost any body if they're not
no I don't ever think you'll get married
right
you're just going to fall in love with a_lot_of girls that's all
it's more easier it's easier not more easier just easier
