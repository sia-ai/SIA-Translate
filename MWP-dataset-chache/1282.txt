supposed to read the first chapter of our book for homework
let's see
good I'm not done with mine yet
I don't know how I don't even know how to do it
oh good for you
use one format sheet for each
alright so what I hafta do is make a sheet like this I guess
hm
yeah
the diseases of people we serve
are you doing math homework
is that math homework
oh
I thought it was math homework
no by lifting up the little paper remember
um as big as the paper
can I see
bring it over to me so I can see
oh
hm
what's so funny
oh that stuff in there
um not bigger than the page will ya
um big as three inches
this about this big maybe
um one inch
about this big
no one
two is like this three is like this four is like this five is like this six is like this
ooh that's little
I like it though
I hafta get a pen and I hafta call Grandmama and tell her that we're not coming today
because we're gonna be going there another day
we're gonna be going there um Friday you're gonna go to Grandpa's office
hm put the circle in the air
I can't see you
where are you
oh there you are
why would you do that
yeah
ooh that's a big circle
that's a big circle
so what I need to do
activities and xxx
that's
speaker
Tigri wants some water
yeah it's good I bought it today

yep

don't you do that were you gonna dump it
put it on my head
okay I'm gonna call Grandma
okay
okay
what are you gonna draw now
something else in the in the sky
hi
how are you
good
oh just looking at my homework you know I didn't I missed the syllabus that week remember I was telling you that I thought I missed that paper
but then I found I ended up finding what I needed but then I got it today and it's like all this stuff that I didn't do
I mean I got it last night but um
I don't know how I missed it you know I really don't I was like kinda mad about it because it woulda been so much easier to have it
xxx but another girl didn't have it either but then I just felt like I don't want the teacher to think I was like you know
flaking off like I yeah like I wasn't doing the work or that I didn't I would lost it or you know what I mean or whatever but
there's nothing I can do about it right
it just that I just didn't get it
and uh she's just I don't know she's really weird about paperwork and stuff
she's just like oh yeah whatever we'll get to that and like she never like makes a big thing about it
so yeah anything we hand in or anything she hands to us she's just very aloof about it I don't know
and on here you know it's like it's got all these readings to do and all this stuff that I haven't done so anyway
yes and we have a quiz next week so
yes
and there's a lot of stuff
oh yeah that's a good idea
that I will do that that's a great idea
I didn't even think of that because I was like oh man I'm gonna be away all weekend how am I gonna get anything done xxx
because I assume like oh I'm not gonna be doing anything
um I'm excited about this weekend
it's gonna be so good
what is the uh I forget what the topic is or what the plan is
name of it
yeah that's what I remember but I'm like I don't even know what it is
but they start like on Friday right
and do you go and like register and stuff when you go go in there
or it's more casual
yeah
yeah
who does
oh oh oh at seven thirty that night you mean
yeah
and so what should we bring
yep
okay
okay that's good
yeah because it will probably be cold
yeah I think it's gonna be pretty out there I'm excited
good I hope it's nice weather
oh that's good
good
I hope it is good
yep
I will bring that and I will bring my homework that's such a good idea
um so yeah we're not coming today
as you probably figured since I hadn't called you before
but it's just such a better idea because
you know
it's just gonna be a lot of driving around this weekend
um but I'm waiting to hear from my uh friend Gwen because she said she could babysit for us tonight
so we could go out to dinner
yeah so I'm just hoping that she still can and
sent her an email
mhm
so
will you tell Dad that um I will plan to be there around three thirty
um I think that's probably the time I'll get there at on Friday
and then I will have
either Harry call down there or whatever because I don't know what his story is
he'll probably just
yeah Thursday they are
mhm
yeah he can I don't know if
you know what what his plan is what time he has to work until or what you know
so I gotta talk to him
you think Dad will be upset about today
oh okay
okay
alright
yes
did he plan on them staying over or
did he plan on Harry coming or do you know
okay well I'll talk to Harry anyway because maybe if he wants to go out then he can just get them in the morning
or he can go after work if he you know he probably he'll probably do that but I just don't know
alright
alright I'm gonna go
and I will uh meet you at Dad's on Friday
alright I'll see you then
okay bye

good job Violet
yeah yeah yeah
oh good yeah
yeah it's really good um the class you know the people in the class are sort of tough
yeah
and she yeah she does it's just like there a lot of them are working you know in the field and they're just sort of
and I understand I mean and it's good to see that point but they're just sort of
you know tough customers it's like they're always like well you can't do that you know because of this or and it's like
I don't know it's just and I I'm I'm grateful to hear that but I don't feel like I'm gonna make any friends in that class
you know
yeah
right yeah
right yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah well that would be nice xxx
um yeah that would be yeah
um so xxx the reason I'm calling you is xxx is well besides that is to invite um you and xxx um and of course xxx if she's around I don't know what your schedule is
um but and this is very late notice because I had this thing for Violet's birthday I wanted to mail it out and I of course always said oh I gotta get xxx address and I never did
so it's next
oh how funny
oh good okay
so it's next it's Tuesday next Tuesday which is the fourth
and it's from three to four thirty
um at our house
okay great
and uh it's gonna be like an animal party so if he can come dressed as an animal
that would be good if he can you know or else whatever you can make up a tail or you know I mean we have stuff here too just make some little ears or I don't know whatever but because they're gonna she wants to play zoo and stuff and
and uh
yeah well it was so funny
yeah because when we were planning I said okay Violet we're gonna you list everybody you want and then when she came up with the idea of like okay everybody should dress as animals and xxx you know we'll take turns being the zoo+keeper and
and then she said oh xxx gonna love this xxx
yeah and wait what did you say Violet that he would come dressed as
yeah that's her birthday her actual birthday
what did you say Violet
oh yeah
she said oh he'll probably come as a dolphin or a dragon
xxx oh well cool so you already have something
oh and he xxx oh totally yeah
oh yeah
yeah three o'clock to four thirty
yeah and then you'll get to meet my husband because he's gonna be here
yeah so that'll be exciting
yeah xxx
yeah I can hear you yeah
that'll be perfect
yeah so
oh good
yeah
no we're pretty you know we're sometimes we're we have nothing and then other times you know it's like you know how it goes you get it comes in waves like of things
and then you don't have anything so um
cool well I'm glad I xxx I uh got you I was panicking before because I was I couldn't find your number but then of course where did I look in the address book
you know xxx I'm like why don't I just keep every number in the address book like
I know
apparently so
so good
yeah we should yeah
yeah yeah
how's your class going
yeah
uhhuh
yeah I do too
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
xxx you right yeah
oh good
that's funny
yeah I could I would I can see getting into that too you know
oh yeah
totally
yeah
right
yeah we were talking about that last night and she's like you know you can just you know teach about anything you know and and I was like yeah you know xxx
great we're gonna teach about like palm reading you know and Tarot cards and all that would be so funny
so yeah but it's just overwhelming the other part of it is that she's so enthusiastic and I write down every single thing she says
and it's so funny because everybody's like you you know don't have_to take notes you know she's like you don't have_to write this down and
another lady came in and she said you don't have_to write this down and I thought well I'm writing everything down because
I'm gonna forget and like I need to know everything you say because you know I feel like she's just like a guru or something you know
I mean I can't imagine that she's just going around doing all that stuff and nobody even knows about her
well some people do in the field
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
I know
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and she is and she's so good too like dealing with people in the class because you know there's this one lady of course you always get this one person in class
Harry and I were joking about this the person who just you know hogs the class with like xxx loads of stupid questions and like personal you know well my father you know
oh yeah just like they just really need to they just really need to get out you know and get a friend I mean it's that's the bottom line
but anyway she's really good at like being you know sort of
you know not overly like delving into it but you know being you know nice enough but also really cutting her off a lot of times
and because she knows you know that's how it's gonna get and and it's just really cool to watch because setting limits you know
and just saying okay well thank for you that and um don't worry about that right now or whatever you know like because
people get crazy
oh my god yeah
yeah
yeah yeah and even it was we had a speaker come in and like I was so disappointed because I got there you know
