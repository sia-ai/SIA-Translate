there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs all so convenient

Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham
it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red
the knife crumpled up and hurt him
he put his finger in his mouth
it is not boiled enough it is hard

Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife
it's as hard as the hams at the cheese monger's
said Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka isn't that a funny name
the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table
let it alone
said Tom Thumb
give me some fish Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish

Mommy
Naima is very congested
you can probably hear that
even Mommy is congested

it's a thing to ride on a surf board
and let's see what else do we have here
this boy is also on a surf board

here's the lifeguard
I think most of the magnets are actually in the car
how about a dump truck do we ever see a dump truck at the beach

and there's a radio
how many sand pipers do you see
at the beach

one
two
three
how many dolphins do you see jumping out of the water
right there are two dolphins jumping out of the water
when we were at Craigville beach
we saw a I don't know what you call it a special kind of truck for beaches
it was actually it was scooping up the sand in this part of it
and then it was putting it through like a sieve almost and it was taking all the garbage out of the sand and also flattening the sand
it was kinda like a road roller for the beach
do you remember that
that was one time when we were at Craigville beach
there's a car is there a truck at the beach today
this is a pickup truck
you know there might be a couple of other uh beach magnets in your room
somewhere although I don't know where exactly
on a surf board
because it's a fun way to ride see you can make them ride
wee she's riding the waves on a surf board

the life the lifeguard watches people who are in the water and makes sure they're safe
is she riding the waves

what's this magnet
oh that's the radio magnet
what
the other kid
oh here
that magnet's in the living room

where in the living room

well because this was something that you were playing with a lot in the car
we could go and get them
if you wanna play with them
this one
okay
climb on board and get to town
there's some trucks there
that truck
this is
this machine
this smashes things see this thing

I think that's a building that's being built there
see this is gonna be the second floor of the building and this might be the first floor of the building
and this is the second floor of the building
and this is the floor
and pretty soon they'll build walls
around all four sides
one two three four
they're going to build four walls
one along this edge
one along this edge
one along this edge
and one along this edge and then it will be a building
did you know that buildings usually have
a regular building usually has four walls
if it's square
that's a square isn't it
or maybe it's a rectangle
I think that's more like a rectangle
