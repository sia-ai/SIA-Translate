no_no the bang bang like that when you touch it that's
right that's the lightning the thunder is the noise that you hear
oh it makes a clap
clap of thunder
right
right and then the air moves

makes you warm and makes the flowers grow and keeps the earth warm
keeps the earth warm
it makes the flowers grow during the day the flowers open up their leaves and the sun comes on their leaves and makes them so_that they can make um sugar
flowers make sugar okay and they use the sugar the flowers eat the sugar and get bigger and bigger
okay and then the bees come and they take that sugar and make honey okay
a honey comb yeah right
the bees
right
okay but the flowers do the big work flowers do the hardest hardest work because they take the sun's energy and make it into sugar and that's called photosynthesis

very good Ross
right Okay that was very interesting
so I can have the light from the back
why
although it is true it's nice to have this light come from behind
it is not is isn't
you don't like my explanation
easier on my eyes right
but was my explanation really a bad explanation
no but not whether my idea was a bad idea
but when I told you the reason I put it up there was to get light from behind
did you think that was really wrong
what was the real reason that I did it
okay thank_you
where do you have_to put your legs up
yeah
I'm not telling
no maybe they're for me and I'm not telling
well maybe they're for Grandpa and Grandma
I'm not sure
I want to go outside and see the witches
what
what's so fare about that
yes
and what's fare for you
so_that the part that's fare for me is that I don't have_to do too much
and what's the part that's fare for you
oh you get to do some
ahhah
I'm falling
is that a good deal for both of us do you think
okay but I thought you were going to talk about another problem you and I have
you forgot about the other problem
what is it
what is that other problem
it had to do with the telephone
yeah there was a problem with the telephone
upstairs in my room
no
there was a little problem we had
what was it
and you hit Marky and so what's the problem
and what other problem was there
what
no what was bad about it
yeah and what else
and what else
and you still haven't apologized to your Grandfather
so there are three bad things
first that you hit Marky
okay four count them
to Marky you didn't apologize to Marky
okay and then third
yeah
and four
no that wasn't that's not something wrong
going to your room is a punishment it's not something you did wrong
okay you want me to tell you what the fourth is
you didn't apologize to Grandpa for not talking to him
you still haven't done that you could do that still
no he didn't do that
and there's one more of the thing that you did that was wrong
is that you made it so your father couldn't talk to Grandpa
five things
okay now which of those can we fix
of those five there is one that we can still fix
daddy
okay
two of them you fix one of them right now
yeah
okay what about the other one
how do you fix that one
when are you going to do
which one
what do you mean maybe today but really tomorrow
ow my foot is falling
you promise you will do it tomorrow
promise
okay and what other promise did you make for me tonight
no no you made another promise to me earlier tonight what was it
it had to do with the Lego blocks
what was the promise
no it had nothing to do with that
you made me a promise remember the little Lego blocks
you made a promise to your father
okay did you do it
ahhah and are they all fixed and put back
do you know what happened
Marky took them together apart again
okay
no no your promise is that you're going to get those blocks back
that's your promise
you understand what a promise is
well that's another problem
now remember what happens if you don't fulfill your promise
what's supposed to happen
okay so is that ready are we ready for that
jump over
okay then after do you promise to put the blocks back together
yeah promise promise
do you promise too
okay
sure honey
something happened to Santa Claus
yeah I guess he needs to be blown up again
what hole
no I didn't find a hole up there
okay honey there wasn't a hole on the very top
well just wait a second Ross you just tell me here's the hole
it's not a hole
that's just maybe it's broken
maybe that's where it's broken
it's not broken
not not broken Ross you're just wrong it's that simple
I want to play Santa Claus
you mean that hole right there
there's no hole
there's just no hole there honey
okay let Ross touch the hole Mom
here's the hole
let him touch it
I found the hole
I found the hole guys
okay we we're pretty sure that Santa Claus is broken now
we're pretty sure Santa Claus is broken because somebody jum hit him too hard
no that's where Dad took Ross out_of the bath+tub and put him on the bed when he was all wet
why what do you mean even when they're dry
oh that's true
do you want more milk
honey you don't say
just my second one
it was my second one
and I don't want anymore
you say
it was just my first and I want one more but it was my second and I'm finished
is that right
girl isn't a baby either
didn't you forget something
this morrow I don't want to take my shoes
why
these are for boys
of course that's not a good reason
right
that's how he put it
uhuh
it was a huge balloon uh
it wasn't a little Heman
oh that's great Ross that's great
Marky did you see that
at
they did
at Children's Palace uh
when did you guys go to Children's Palace
oh you went you saw them on tv
oh the add
do you want toys Ross
right those toys you want are for Christmas so why should we go to Children's Palace
we already
oh well we'll go after this Christmas is finished okay
I want a real real bad monster who steps on Heman
your amigo
oh they don't have amigos any more
amigos they're not going to get for a awhile only if we're lucky
they stopped carrying amigos
isn't that horrible
just like they stopped showing the Phoenix dirty trick right
is that fare Ross
do you want some of the potatoes
right
why can't I
you teasted me you tricked me into that
right
do you still play with Brian
sometimes
how come you learned learned it from him
he does
do you ever play with him at all
who do you play with now
yeah who do you play with now
and
and
Austin and Maria Lane no
and who else
Jeannie
Jeannie
okay
that means you didn't go outside
it means don't go
we cuffed outside so we not outside right
we no
we didn't go outside so cuffed means didn't go
how about we cuffed go outside
what do you say
uncuffed go
ahhah uncuffed means yes
oh uncuffed means yes
well that's nice
and the word what is the word
that means that
uncuffed right
and what if I say to you do you want some chocolate what do you say
that means no
and what if I say do you want ah some toys for Christmas
what do you say
uncuffed good very good
tell the whole story now
uhhum
uhhum
well where where are the meat
where is the meat
in his tummy
yeah but in meat eaters where's the meat
so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter eaters don't have any meat
Ross that can't be right
that doesn't make sense
all animals have meat are full with meat
meat eater means they eat meat
dad
yes Marky just a minute
what is that
bologna and um mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not Marky
oh
it's not butter
is that butter
no
they're recording
that's okay
um Ross it doesn't make any sense
to say that that the plant eaters don't have any meat
is this butter
because their bodies are made of meat
your body is made of meat
only if you eat meat
you have meat in it
yeah you have meat in your body
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat
you see you gotta understand something okay
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body
muscles
muscles muscles are meat
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce
that's not meat is it
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen
no it'll go no your going to make apple sauce arms
no
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in_case you want seconds or thirds
which one did you say
what's the difference
hum
it make more sense
good Ross
do you want some milk
oh I'm sorry honey Ross spilt some water
what happened Ross
tell the whole story
well what's you say
yeah go ahead it's okay
tell the whole story
and it feels like I was shocked
shocked
I feel something in my neck and it feels like I was shocked
it felt like I was shocked
uhuh
what
sure they can
but how do you get a headache that shocks
you must be sick
how about Mom
is she sick
okay
Marky said get out his way I'm playing Robin
get out_of this way
let's go eat breakfast
to sleep
oh right yeah he needs a nice soft bed doesn't he
okay
what
how'd you learn to count by
you learned to tell time
uhhum
heh Ross
is that twelve o'clock midnight or is that twelve o'clock noon
if it's late at night is it midnight or is it noon
right midnight Mom
oh
I don't know to eat some berries
yeah
why did the bear cross the street Ross
right
could you play
mom makes good toast
why Ross
right a pony has four legs
very good
I want to interject that um this I believe that this comes from you telling him that you didn't even want to hear him asking
not tonight but other times
there has been quite a deal made over asking
sometime I do I don't even want to hear you ask for it
yeah and
and so he asked could I ask
yeah and it sounds like a politeness form but it actually has a very obvious function may I ask can I get away with it
well he may have I doubt I doubt that explanation
I can't imagine but he you know
certainly certainly it could be supported it could be supported
