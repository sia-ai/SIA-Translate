eating hummus also keeps you healthy

alright
you know I'm not sure this kiwi's ripe it's very hard
I'm gonna see if it's ripe
it feels hard and a
ripe kiwi I think shouldn't feel this hard
but I'm gonna slice it and I'm gonna try it and then I will tell you if it's
okay to eat
cause it needs to be ripe
before you can eat it needs to be ripe
because eating things that aren't ripe
will sometimes make you sick
I think it's alright actually
and I'm gonna put some banana in there too for you
oh it's going to be so delicious
it's going to be so scrumptious
yes
look at that
fruit
bowl

you think it was a new one
yes when you pooped in your bathtub we had to throw away your watering can
cause it
got
too dirty to clean

you can't use something that has poop on it
sometimes you can clean things that have poop on em and sometimes you can't
in this

how's the kiwi do you like it

ouch
yes I went to a meeting at the food co_op
that was
let's see that was not last night that was the night before last
that's where I was
I had to talk about what kind of food we're going to order
what kind of food we want the truck to bring
that's what I was doing
well because
the co_op is a group of people who have_to pick out things and have to decide things
and talk about the reasons we're gonna do things one way or the other
that's kinda what a meeting is usually
the food co_op yeah
you know who else was at that meeting
you know xxx from play+group
her Mommy was at that meeting and so was her grandma
they're also in the food co_op
in fact they invited us to be in their food co_op

well I think you didn't realize that you needed to poop
page seventy two is completely missing
page seventy two in this cookbook is completely missing
well cause some pages are missing

you wanna see that fly flying

well we do wanna let them go outside
well they belong outside they don't really belong in the house
sometimes they come in the house by accident
and sometimes they come maybe because they smell food and the door's left open just a crack
just like in the cat book
yeah
people sometimes leave doors open by accident and then cats can get out
flies can get in mosquitoes can get in
let's get this bit of green food off your nose there

brocco hummus
actually b is the first letter in brocco hummus
buh buh it makes the buh buh sound
that's just the sound that letter b makes
yep I'm right here
yep I don't see the fly where is it
I'm not seeing the fly
you worried about the fly
you don't really need to be worried about the fly flies don't really bite
most of the flies that come in the house anyway they're not the kind that bite
yessie
okay
okay
nice xxx xxx you wanna drink some water
Daddy's gonna get you some water I think
little cups
you can use this one
it's a big cup
xxx that xxx it's kinda old
Sleepy_Bear's got his
booties on
you wanna come look at books with Mommy now
on the bed
oh you want fresh air you know the other the windows are also open
I think there's plenty of fresh air in this room cause both windows are open
are you recording
yes I am um
there's some food that still needs to get stuck in the fridge in the kitchen
okay
that's all that needs to happen
you wanna read
xxx go down and make my phone call
but I have two to make
yeah that's fine that's fine
you wanna read Snow_Day with me
okay
a bocka bocka bocka
are you being a chicken
a chicken who says bocka bocka bocka bocka bocka
let's read Snow_Day and then
um then we'll go get jama for you
cause you you need a pajama top
and then
after you get your pajama top on
Mommy will brush Mommy's teeth
Daddy did a good job didn't he
you started to do the zipper
which zipper
does the big pillow have a zipper
oh I guess I didn't know that you can show me afterwards
yes I am
what's going on in this picture
there's a snow+storm happening
take your hand off the microphone though
there's a snowstorm happening
cause there's snow coming out of the sky out of the clouds
mm weather watchers had been predicting a big snow+storm for days
uh what kind of a truck is that
that is a snowplow
it's doing what to the snow
what did you say it was doing
factoring the snow
it's pushing the snow
those that part of the snowplow pushes the snow
mm so that the cars can drive you're right
cars can't drive through this kind of snow
so the plow is taking the snow out of the streets
even before the snow stopped falling town work crews were out with their trucks to begin a long hard job of digging out
mm
oh we skipped a page
look at all the houses and buildings and schools and there's a church
they're all covered with snow
all the buildings and look I think that's a snowplow over there
it is
and do you know what these are
these are electric wires
they're carrying electricity from
building from one building to another
or maybe those are telephone wires actually
hm those might be electric and telephone wires
the wire that you saw at Craigville beach with Daddy and the ducks that you saw on the way
you remembering seeing those things
you saw a wire in the sand huh
did Daddy say it was he thought it was for a phone that they used to have in the lifeguard's chair
I think that's what you told me that he said it was
remember we saw a lifeguard today at Douse's beach
she was wearing red pants
and a red swim+suit
xxx she was a lifeguard
lifeguards sometimes wear red
yes they do they like to go in the water with swimsuits
well lifeguards are there in case anybody has trouble in the water and they need help
lifeguards are there to go and and give them help if they need help in the water
because if you don't know how to swim sometimes you can have
uh difficulty in the water swimming
and you need some help you need someone to help carry you
but you're not gonna have that problem cause you'll learn how to swim
there's the plow again I see it
it's orange
I also see a whole lot of school buses covered with snow
dyou see them
right there
all the school buses are covered with snow and they're not taking the children to school
because there's too much snow
yeah
that
mhm
that boy is holding a teddy+bear
that's a family who is waking up and looking out at the snow
and finding out that it's a snow day
oh boy everybody's having fun here what's everybody doing
you tell me what do you see
she is
about to throw a snowball at
that kid
and that kid is throwing a snowball way over there
they're having a snowball fight
that means you make balls out of the snow and you throw them
snowball fight
that's a game it's kind of a game that kids play
big kids play
cause it's fun to make the snowballs and then they throw them at each other and they go phwack
phwack
thwack
oh the dinosaur the dinosaur's tail sounds like thwack you remember that
yeah
oh did that hurt
aw
I see some kids building a snow+man
the kid in the red jacket is making a snow+man
that's a huge snowball I think
that maybe they are building a an igloo
out of snow
or a snow fort
I think that's she's carrying some snow to build a wall there
it's fun to build things with snow
it's just a fun thing to do that's all
and I see a lot of kids who are sliding on sleds down the hill
in this picture
that sled is being pulled by a mommy
mhm
oh they're going to see Tahoe on the way home
I think you're remembering when it was winter and Mommy pulled you and the sled up the driveway and you saw Tahoe
was she barking
yeah
she was a young dog then
dyou know that bird sound right now
those are morning doves

I don't think
sort of a joke
sort of
you can see his new car you've never watched him drive away in his new car
you've only watched him drive away in his old car
he's waving to you
because he's waving byebye
baddy baddy baddy baddy

it has a different noise than the old car
byebye Daddy with his new car
what this
or this
or this
oh this
that's a clothes+pin
it's a special kind of magnet clothes+pin
did you like using clothes+pins this morning
that was fun
we could actually bring a few to uhhh xxx and I mean rather to uhhh
xxx and xxx house this morning so you can keep practicing
would you like to do that
we could bring some doll clothes and you could hang them
mhm
I dunno if xxx has legos
you wanna see what his toys look like
yeah he might have some interesting toys
he's a little toddler but he still might have some toys that are fun to play with but I do think we should bring our own toys
well because I don't know for sure if his toys are gonna be fun to play with because he's littler than you
because he is sixteen months old
and you are how many months are you now
let's see is this June July
March April May June July
four months
so sixteen weeks plus twenty
no twenty four months plus four
you are twenty eight months old Naima
you're twenty almost twenty eight months old and xxx is sixteen months old
I'm gonna
I'm gonna bring some grapes to play+group
oh that would be very interesting I wonder what his high+chair looks like
well we're not going to xxx house
xxx and xxx and xxx are probably going to come to xxx house just like we are
we're going to xxx and xxx house
yeah we could ask xxx to show us
we could ask xxx to show us
and you know what they live near the South Yarmouth library
where we used to go
to listen to stories
remember xxx who used to be there the librarian
do you remember her
she used to sing welcome welcome everyone now you're here we'll have some fun
xxx used to be in that story group
library group
remember that
yeah when you were a littler but you weren't really well you were a baby when you started
but then you were a little toddler when we still used to go there
you used to do trot trot to Boston trot trot to xxx you better watch out or you might fall in
remember doing that
at the library
and you used to do it with xxx sometimes too
let's see
and who else was in that library group do you remember the other
when you were a bigger toddler
or when you were a little toddler
you're a big toddler now
well
you did go to a toddler group after we stopped going to that library group
where Jane used to come and read stories and then there was a craft
you did that a couple of times
there were a lot of children there do you remember
I don't remember we only went to that twice I think
so I didn't really learn their names
if we have time we could go to the South Yarmouth Library after our play group and see if they have the Bear Family book and check it out
would you like to do that
I thought so
Waldo is in that book
is Waldo the Grandpa bear
maybe you're right
I thought he was I thought he was Uncle Waldo
you want some more grape
with a towel
do you think bears use towels
I think they might just shake themselves off likes dogs do
because it's easier than having to have a towel
they do what
what do bears do
bear potties
bear parties
or bear potties
which
bear parties
bear potties
oh
bears actually don't use potties at all do they
they just poop in the forest
and the baby bear poops in the forest too
or in the meadow
because animals don't
animals don't use potties except cats who live in the house use uhhh cat potties
yup
um I don't think that animals do that's a rule for people
that they need to wash their hands when they poop or pee
after they poop or pee
well animals don't usually do that although cats and some animals do clean themselves up after they poop or pee in the potty
I am looking for
oh there's pictures of pee+pee and poop in that animal pee+pee and poop
well you tell me what do oops
something came tumbling out of the freezer because our freezer has so much junk in it
I might pack some other lunch things for you because if we have lunch with Daddy then we'll need to have more stuff
you spilled some milk just now
oh okay that's not a big deal
I'm not worried about it
I'm gonna clean it up anyway
this cheese that I'm gonna pack up for
no not for xxx for you to eat either at snack+time or lunch+time

what else are those children doing
should we add some words to these books
we could write some words
oh do you remember who made these books
yes we did
why are they home+made books
because we made them at home
we need to snap these
get these snapped
is that in your way
let me adjust it a little for you
well I'd kinda like to leave it on you for just a little while while we're taping
recording
let's keep looking at the books
what do we see here
should we write the names of these animals in the book
I guess we need either a crayon or a magic marker to do that
you wanna learn how to write
because why
oh you don't
I see
let's see if I can get this off
a boogie+board
was there a girl with a boogie+board at the beach
I thought we were gonna go get magic markers so that we could write words in those books that we made yesterday
you're gonna learn how to write okay
okay
okay
I see with the magic marker okay
uhhh oh let's get the magic marker
you know we could use crayons
why are you upset
yes I'm getting the magic markers
you want some paper

crayons are good
and we certainly have some
you don't want what
oh

yeah this is paper right here
yeah there are ants in the kitchen
I don't like ants in my kitchen okay
so here's some crayons
and you want to learn how to write some words you said

practicing is good too
that's a yellow crayon
isn't it
oh you're taking that page out
okay
alright
well you can still write on it though look it's good to write on
why don't you write on that
well you need to write on a hard surface like this
that's a nice hard surface and you could put here you could put this down
you could draw on that one
what color um crayons should I use to write the names of the animals
okay
okay orange
should I write eagle here
you can just leave that alone okay
just leave it alone just ignore it
that means don't pay attention
okay I'm gonna write
eagle right here
do you know how to spell eagle

oh see it
or you wanna practice
using the clothes+pins now

oh did that clothes+pin break
alright I'll see if I can fix that
well it's broken right so why don't you give it to me and I'll see if I can put it back together
okay
you didn't think it was delicate I think
but it was a little bit delicate
okay
what are you doing
you're putting clothes+pins there
how about putting them on this side now
because there's more room here
hm
it's not easy is it
you did it there
should we do it together

I think that's the other part why don't you give that one to me

I think you're doing a pretty good job actually

I like these new clothes+pins they're so
new and clean and they're in these nice colors
blue and white

don't step on that please
because I don't want you to step on it

can you just why don't you practice by just putting a clothes+pin on that line
can you do that
do it the same way you do it on the box you have_to hold the top of the clothes+pin
push

we can't put it up right because the twine is too small
if it were thicker twine then it would stay up right I think
