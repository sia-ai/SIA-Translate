okay
we are here to launch the new rail line through the mountains of Sodor sir Toppenhat announced
today we open the big big bridge
what wonderful news everyone cheered
the mountains were beautiful
the people of Soder couldn't wait to visit them
xxx there it is
what's that
it's a big big bridge that's right
everyone wanted to see the big big bridge
it had towers so high that tops touched the sky
and the valley beneath was so deep that when you were on the big big bridge you could barely see the ground
Thomas was excited about the new rail line
this is really a special day he said happily
look who's this
is that Henry and then Henry chugged up to Thomas
the big engine frowned
I don't want to go to the mountains Henry said nervously
it's windy up there very very windy
Henry didn't like the wind
Henry didn't like rain or snow or hail either
we're a big engine Henry Thomas said you shouldn't be afraid of a little wind
but Henry was afraid
that made Thomas a bit afraid too
look at there's everybody who's this here
that's right
Gordon xxx
Gordon Henry Thomas hitch up your coaches called sir Toppenhat
it's time for your first trip to the mountains
Percy and James were glad they didn't have_to go to the mountains
they were afraid to cross the big big bridge
there's nothing to be afraid of Thomas insisted
in a voice loud enough for Percy and James to hear
it will be easy to cross the big big bridge
ah who's that
that's Thomas
xxx Thomas and Henry chugged to the platform Gordon the express engine was already there xxx xxx excuse me
his coaches were full of passengers
Annie and Clarabelle were soon hitched behind Thomas
hurry hurry they called
but they
who's that
that's Thomas and that's the conductor
that
this is sir Toppenhat
that was very good
and this is the conductor
all aboard
cried the conductor
Sir Toppenhat turned to the crowd and waved his hat one last time
toot+toot Gordon whistled
follow me
in a burst of steam the big blue engine was off
soon the trains were rolling through the country+side in a long line
Gordon took the lead
here's Gordon
behind him chugged Henry and then because he was the smallest came
who's that
that's Thomas that's right
well all along the way people came out of the house and cheered when they saw the trains go by
at the foot of the mountain Henry slowed to a crawl
these mountains are much too high he moaned
I can't go I'm afraid of heights
don't be silly Thomas said bravely
I'll be right here behind you
but Henry didn't budge
he was nervous
that made Thomas nervous too
c'mon Thomas gently pushed Henry
we have_to go
the brand new tracks were smooth and shiny
but Henry barely moved along them
the truth was Henry didn't want to reach the top of the mountain
because then he'd have_to cross the big big bridge
if Percy and James and Henry are all afraid thought Thomas maybe I should be frightened too
finally Thomas and Henry arrived at the top of the mountain
there it was what's that
xxx that's right a big big bridge and there's tracks on it too
you're right
and it was high
it was windy up there too
very windy
I won't go Henry declared
but we have_to cross Thomas said bravely
our passengers want to see the mountains on the other side
hurry hurry Annie and Clarabelle cried
the coaches were so excited that Thomas had trouble keeping them in line
Thomas searched the tracks ahead
Gordon was nowhere to be seen
he had already crossed the big bridge and rolled into the mountains beyond
Thomas and Henry were alone
I'll go first Thomas said at last
then you can follow me Henry
if the wind blows close your eyes Henry said that way you won't see anything scary
here
what's this one say
click_clack click_clack click_clack Thomas began to cross the bridge
that's right
there's a click and a clack
he's a train crossing the bridge
the big big bridge
yes there's a click_clack because he
there was a gust of wind and it made him nervous right and he closed his eyes and then his
because he xxx he wasn't paying attention to where he was going
his wheels came off the track
right
xxx you alright Thomas Henry called
I'm stuck Thomas said glumly I couldn't see where I was going and my front wheels have jumped the track
just then Gordon returned and he frowned when he saw Thomas stuck in the middle of the bridge
go find Harold Gordon xxx cried to Henry
relieved Henry backed down the mountain to find the helicopter
Thomas kept his eyes closed he was too afraid to look
but inside his coaches the passengers enjoyed the wonderful view
finally Thomas heard the whir of rotors
xxx there he is Harold was here to rescue him
slowly Thomas opened his eyes he looked at the blue sky above and the green mountains all around
