look at her she's all dressed up isn't she
you know what
she's strolling her cat in a baby carriage isn't she
that's pretty silly huh
okay well Charlie she stops to pick a flower
and what happens
it sure es
look at how surprised she is
she's just amazed isn't she
it's hiding behind a tree isn't it
I guess he doesn't want her to see her
what do you think
look
she's running to tell somebody
and who does she tell
policeman an another kid on a bike too
he's got a tricycle doesn't he
member Courtney's tricycle
member at the party
there's the kitten
they see it
she looks a lot happier doesn't she
but you know what
that kitten is not going to cooperate
look it's running away from them
see that
and she is angry because the kitten's gotten away and the policeman didn't catch it the little boy thinks it's funny doesn't he
what are they trying to do Charlie
they're trying to get the kitten to come to them
you know what
I think he's all dressed up in a costume
what do you think is under there
what do you think
goodness
should we see if we can turn the page and find out
you know what
oh we missed a page
he went into the sewer this cat
and they went into the sewer after it
xxx an the kitten's on the other side watching them go through
what's that
a shoe and his pants huh
that's underneath his costume
and then he comes out_of the sewer
and the cat's just watching them huh
and then he runs away
they look very unhappy don't they
more huh
oops did you know what they're in Charlie
what's that
do you know
they're in the water
at least it looks like water to me
I think that's what they're in
and he's helping her get out
and they fall straight in the water altogether don't they
look how happy the cat looks
he looks really delighted huh
wango
right into the water
and there goes the cat back into the sewer
whad do ya think happens
out they get
they are furious
they just cann't believe how that cat has had them on
and who catches the cat
that little boy does huh
what kinda boots has he got
well they're big cowboy boots
I don't know why she's angry at him Charlie
does she seem to be angry at him
oh I guess he let the cat go away
and the cat got onto the policeman's head
right
he still doesn't want them to get him back in the baby carriage that's what I think
what do you think
look Charlie
now he's way out on a limb isn't he
oops they finally caught him and he's angry and the little boy's angry but these two are happy
they think they've done a nice thing don't they
oops
oh
what happened
he got the boots
oh
you're right
his shoe fell off didn't it
yeah
and what happened here
the branch broke
see the tree branch broke and they came tumbling down
my_goodness now it's all changed around
now the little boy is in the baby carriage isn't he
and the cat is walking behind
and he looks tired out
should we just finish
we're almost to the end of the story
should we just wait and see what happens at the end
she goes inside right
she tells him to wait a minute
and she brings them all out some milk and cookies
now she's dressed up like a nurse isn't she
is that a good story
that's a good idea
let's fix that thing
yeah it does
but you hafta try for a minute
yeah
that's right
hm
where did this come from
oh I know
I think that that sets the car up
so_that if we get the tire out
we could change that tire if we want
you know whatcha hafta do
you hafta unscrew it first
that's a boy
look at that
yeah almost
that's a boy
yeah
it is
you could do it with your fingers
do just the screw part
try lifting it up Charlie
an see if it comes up
not quite
try doing just the screw part
can you do just the screw part with your fingers
that's a boy
yeah
it's hard work isn't it
you try doing it with just your fingers
other way
other way
other way
that's a boy
I'll betcha it comes out now
there you go congratulations Charles
you did it
that's fantastic
now in_order_to fix it you know what we have_to do
take off one of these tires
I think we needa use the screw+driver again
there you go
do you know what
let's tip it over on it's side okay
that'd be an easier way
now you can do it
there you go Charlie
yeah perfect
look what came off the other side too
you hear noise
you didn't hear anybody
you're doing it right
I think it needs maybe a little bit more screw first
that's a boy
good for you
good for you
you can lift it out_of it try and just lift it out
you did it
that's terrific
wanna do the other side too
did you know what I think Charlie
I bet you could take the whole car apart
there you go
very nice work
that's kinda fun
yeah
how about unscrewing this one
do you know what then we could do
we could take out this whole section here
you don't want to
oh okay
what would you like to do
now um okay so you wanna put a wheel back on
is that what you wanna do
what's that
goodness
I wonder where that came from Chuck
something I don't understand
either place
which one do you want him to sit at
there you go
well then you'd better move him over a little bit huh
you driving better over there
you're right
you're right in front
you're right Charlie
he doesn't fit very well to be for driving
you're right Chuckie Chuck
it's not very well designed for that
what's in there
the engine
you betcha
no that goes in the back part
you know what I think you need for that
what's this
can you take that part off
the engine part
you don't have_to unless you want to
so I guess you won't do that
yeah you know what Charlie
go at it from the front
go go this way and then do it
I think that'll make it easier
look you have_to turn one way or the other way until it gives a little bit to see which way it goes
there you go
that's a boy
yeah
there you go
yeah
now you can do it with your fingers cann't you
just like the tire there it goes
bravo Charlie
yeah you take the whole thing off cann't ya
you know what that means
car cann't run can it
got no engine
you know what that's for Charlie
that means when you put the tire back on
you can sc you sc use the screw and the screw screws into that thing and it stays in place
wanna try it and see if it works
you want me to hold the tire on for you while you put the screw on
yeah
try that
here
other way I think Charlie
gotta screw the other way
yeah
look
see what happened
that's what's keeping the screw on
but the man fell down
which man fell down
oh he sure did
can you see him up straight again
you know what
these little places right here
are where you're supposed to put the people
and they don't fit in front of the right in front of the driver's wheel if it were a real car you would put them in front of the driver's wheel
you're right
so it cann't move yeah
what about that one
should we do that one tool
but you know what you hafta check inside first
why don't you open up and see if the bolt is there
that little yellow piece
oopsie
we're missing the little bolt
how about if we put that one in that square little hole there
xxx I'd say that's good
except it's gotta fit in doesn't it
does it fit
good
uhhuh
now what're we missing
you betcha
yep
that's a boy
that's the right way
you've got it
we're fixers yeah do you remember the name for people who fix cars
member in in Trucker Joe
who are the people who fix his truck for him
do you remember
mechanics
that's right
that's what we are mechanics huh
should we put that one back in too
okay just right
and what holds it on
can you find it behind you
what's behind you
where's the one that fi holes that on
we gotta have sumpin to hold on the engine though
we have one
the screw holds it on that's right
but we're missing it
where is it
that's for the wheel
but where's the one that holds this one on
I think maybe you should
oop
what do you think
is that the one
it is holding on
but Chuck you know
okay now
oh we do
okay
the which part
the hammer part Charlie
is that the one
oh okay
you know what I think that's supposed to be for
I think that's supposed to be for holding the car
up while you fix the tires
that's the way
those are all the things the mechanics use huh
this is a screw+driver
right
that's a wrench
oh we forgot a whole side of the car
uh oh
better take em out for a minute
because you know what we have_to look at inside
find out if the little yellow bolt uh nut is there
better look inside first don't you think
not there

it's just like a real car
hm

we had to change the tire on the highway
you were there
there you go

what about the other tire on the other side
these are the drivers
huh
okay
there it is
oh
what is that called
right
a what
a backer car
what's that
oh
that's called a jack
it holds the car up
right
so_that you can get the wheel off better just like when real cars ha have
hm
I think you just need one
I think you did that right
that's very good
no
they
people xxx
when they put cars up they only do one end of the car
here
is that going in okay
no
not really
ah
I'm not sure if that's what really what it is
but
it could you could use it for that
what
do you want me to help you you mean
so you can get done faster
okay
which ones do you want me to take apart
you tell me which ones
the wall
you mean I get to do all that
okay
I'll try
you show me how
okay
do I unscrew right here
okay
okay
here
I'll start unscrewing this
you want to help me finish it up
after I do it for a little bit
okay
thank_you
oh
wait a minute
I gotta do a little bit more
it's still tight
okay
now you could do it
do you know how to put this car back together again when you're finished taking it apart
oh
I think that would be the hardest part
putting it back together again
huh
okay
yeah
oh
we've got one more wheel back here before you can take the sides out and and other screws here
want me to do this one
or do you want to do it
you know what this part of the car's called
well
it's a screw on this car
but on real cars it's called a hubcap
well
it's not really a hubcap
but it looks like the hubcap part of a real car
yeah
it's a plastic screw
yeah
that's true
I think that goes from the front the
that's the uh windshield I think
do you wanna finish taking that screw out so you can take the side out
oh
and there's the trunk
here finish that one so we can take the side out
oh
boy
and then
now you can take it out
oh
oh
look_it
it's all falling apart
oh
I don't
how are we ever going to get this back together again
here
yeah
I think you gotta go the other direction
you're making it tighter
do you have a car like this at your school
oh
can you take the cap you go in apart just like this
oh
oh
I see
gotta unscrew that
oh
it even has a motor
wow
and
and uh here's a screw here honey
and the those are the the headlights right
that's an awful big screw+driver
I think the one that you have at home would work better
mhm
right
do you think it would
is it really lost
or is it just someplace with your toys
you gotta go the other way
in what car
uh
really
oh
I think this is a really nice toy
yes
I do
I don't know
let me see
that's unusual
I don't know what that is
oh
I see
it slides out
you know what that was I think
I'm not sure
but I think that was just a spare
I don't know why that was there
that's funny
here it is
oh
boy
yeah
uh
you're almost done really
you know what I'd like to do
I would like to put it back together
cause that would be a real challenge
I could help you
would you help me a little bit
alright
why don't you finish that
it's not finished
and then we'll start putting it together
your Uncle Ricky used to take things apart all the time when he was a little boy too
he one time he took apart a whole radio
and he didn't know how to put it back together again
well
he just got a screw+driver and started taking it apart
and Grandma Betty got very angry cause it was a good radio
oh
I don't think anything very serious
but now he knows how to put things back together again
okay
looks like that's about it
isn't it
are there any other other screws on there that you could take out
I asked you a question
are there any other screws that you could take out there
yes or no
right
you're right
there aren't
hm
that's a wrench
that
you could have used that for some of them but uh
some of the screws did
but instead you used the screw+driver
okay
let's figure out
does this look like a car
it doesn't even look like a car anymore
oh
boy
um
no
that doesn't come out though
okay
I think this is the top of the car because this is where the people sit
I think
okay
now
that means we have_to put the headlights in front
right
or in back too
that's true
this is the trunk
over here
I think
it's not
alright
le let's see here
oh
boy
do those have_to go in first
let me try
okay
oh
no
they need to be the blue ones
the blue ones are the thin ones
yeah
alright
would you rather look at the book for a few minutes
and then we'll do this later
cause they want us to read a story from that book
do you wanna do that
sure
well
I don't know if there's any words
xxx me see it
bring the bring the book to me please
oh
that's a tape recorder I don't think you should touch that
would you bring me the book please honey
it's in that big box up there
number one it says on it
I put
I don't think I could even get this back together if I tried
okay
let's just look at that for a little bit
and then
okay
let's get on this
we have_to be on the mat
come on the mat
sure
uhhuh I'll try
would you help me
oh
you don't
huh
okay
it's called The_great_cat_chase
a wordless book by Mercer Mayer
what kind of a name is that
what's that
yeah
okay
this little girl is is rolling her kitty in a baby carriage
do you trunk that kitty's a baby or just a pretend baby
yeah
is that little girl wearing real little girl clothes
they look kinda funny to me
it looks like they're her Mommy's old clothes
do little girls usually have purses like that and big hats
no
that's pretty silly
she's playing dress up
just like you do sometimes
uh oh
what's happening here
what happened
what's that kitty doing there
hm
hiding
that's right
the kitty ran away while the little girl was picking a flower
and she goes
oh_my_goodness
see
she's all surprised
and the kitty ran behind the tree
and he's hiding
and he's even smiling
isn't he
pretty funny okay
and the little girl's all upset
isn't she
and what is she doing
who is she gonna go talk to here
is that a real policeman
that looks like a little boy dressed up as a policeman
and he he's blowing his whistle
and she says
oh no
oh no
my kitty's gone
and the policeman what points to the
yeah
and says
there's your kitty lady
the kitty was found
and the policeman's walking over here to start to get the kitty
but does that kitty look happy or sad now
mad
right
and what happened to that policeman when he tried to catch the kitty cat
I know
cause he tripped and fell on his shirt
it was too big for him
what kind of shirt is that guy using wearing
Batman shirt
just like the one you're gonna get
yeah
okay
so
now they're gonna try to catch the kitty some more
and they're walking up very quietly saying
here kitty kitty kitty
is that how people call kitty cats
they hit them
is that very nice
to hit kittys
I sure wouldn't like that
no
it is not really nice to hit animals
people don't do that
only mean people who do that
so
here's the kitty
and he's walking to a into a great big what
right
so
they all go through the pipe
and here is the kitty watching them from the other end
and they're all going to go through the pipe to try and get that kitty
and as_soon_as they get out what happens
he fell into the little water
see
any the kitty just ran up the hill
cause kittys are better climbers than people
aren't they
would you like to fall in water like that right on your nose
hm
I wouldn't like that
yeah
but they don't have their clothes off
do they
no
oh
isn't that a nice policeman
he's helping the girl out_of the of the pipe
see
he's very gallant
but uh oh
they fall again
right in the water
all their clothes are gonna get muddy
huh
have you ever gone in the water with all your clothes on like that
that would be funny
yeah
that's true
that kitty thinks it's awfully funny that they're falling in the water
huh
okay
why do you think that kitty has whiskers coming out_of his top of his head
well
it looks kinda strange
uh oh
they all splash in the water
and there the kitty goes running through the pipe again
and they are so angry this little boy and girl who are dress up like a lady and a policeman
I think they're really determined to get the cat now
but who get him
who got the cat
the little boy
right
the one that was wearing the Batman shirt
he caught the cat
oh
and look the cat is is on top of that little boy's head
does he look very happy
oh
I think he's scratching him
he must hurt him
huh
have you ever been scratched by a cat
did Pam Rich's cat ever scratch you
oh
that hurts
doesn't it
when they go can you show me how it feels
oh
yeah
that is how it feels
so
this little girl is very angry at the little toy for letting the cat go on top of the policeman boy's head
and she's bawling him out
you know how you can tell she's bawling him out
she's holding onto his ear and going can you do that with your hand
go
you don't know how
hm
okay
they the cat starts running up the tree
do you think the cat's gonna escape
think so
look_it
I can even see the scratch marks on the little policeman
oh no
they all
he climbed up the tree to try to get the cat
the cat's hanging on that little limb
you think the limb's gonna break
hm
you tell me
what happened
he got the kitty
that's right
and what's this boy doing here
something not very nice
he's sticking his tongue out
no
that's just a little boy
that's not really a policeman Davey
it's just a little boy dressed up as a policeman
she the great big funny shoes and the big blue shirt
that's not really a policeman
he just has a police outfit on
okay
anyway
the police boy got the cat
and the lady the little girl that's dressed like a lady is so happy
and the little boy that's got the Batman shirt on is very angry
and so he stuck his tongue out
and then what happened
the cat fell
and the little boy fell
see how the branch broke
that's what could happen when you go climbing on trees and d don't go on strong l limbs the branch breaks and goes
crash
and the cat fell
and the little girl caught him and the policeman fell and landed right on the little boy with the Batman shirt
and they're all just so battered and tired and dirty
and here they go walking home
except this time the kitty is following
behind and the little boy with the Batman shirt is riding in the carriage
they are so tired and so scratched up
and the little girl is going into her house
and what's she bringing them
what's she got on that tray
well
she's dressed as a nurse
but that's not really doctor stuff
it looks like lemonade and cookies or or something like that
see
the glasses and the pitcher and the cookies
where's Daddy
I think he's behind there someplace
wait
