made of marble
and Norman the doorman likes likes busts

yay
that's right
lots_of books
lots of books
ah books
what book is that
Lulu
Norman the doorman
you wanna read Norman
Norman
okay
okay
in front of a small well hidden hole
around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named
Norman
Norman was a doorman
he greeted all the art loving creatures
she's wearing a dress
you're right
you're right
oh I think he's wearing a lil scarf
on his neck
he greeted all the art loving creatures
who came to see the treasures
which were kept in the basement of the museum
come right in Norman would say
a lil scarf
and a dress
right
right a scarf
we're quite safe said Norman I sprung all the traps
oo what do you see
a bust
we saw a white bust in the museum here right
Norman would explain every painting in detail
and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care
a sad clown and a statue you're right
he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself
he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of Greek sculpture
which rested in the dark corners of the storage room
she is wearing quite a snazzy dress I think
as oh we missed a page
Norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard
who often came to the basement to set traps for mice
his bright flashlight frightened the visitors
I know they're running away from the guard
yeah
as for Norman he always managed to escape
and hide inside an old armored knights helmet
up there he felt perfectly safe
actually the helmet was Norman's home
which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio
just see what a splendid sky light the visor made
like most everybody Norman had a hobby
each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful
perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue
one bitter cold day Norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire
I know he's making something out of wire
it's a mouse trap
he took it apart
and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right
right
he made a trapeze
that's right
all through the day and far into the night Norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes
until at last he created something he was really proud of
it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze
oh yes
that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse
early next morning when Norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway
he noticed a man reading a sign nearby
he read the sign to
sculpture contest
open to all artists great and small
last day today
back he flew
why can't I show my wire statue he said
as he slid through the visor opening
but what would he call it
all pieces must have a title he well knew
suddenly he had an inspiration
stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together
trapeze
now he had a fitting title for his wire work
although Norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat
then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces
Norman put a cover over his statue as he
there the mouse is hiding there under the cover
yeah away he scooted
up the snowy staircase he climbed
once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another
he still had to be extremely careful of the guard
there's a bust you're right
the other bust is sad
yes
the accordion right
you're right
it's an accordion
what's this
is that a statue of a woman dancing
yeah
she looks like she's having a good time
don't you think
yes
and there's a statue of a man riding a horse
and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon
after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work
out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best
you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do
she is wearing a dress
what color is her dress
oh another dress
wow
two dresses what color are they
yellow and pink
meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum
the judges were busy judging
oh
there it is
quietly and seriously they examined each piece
trying to find which ones deserved prizes
gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue
now this is an amazing creation exclaimed one
there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny
yes but remember the contest is open to great and small
one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not I
the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist
but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped
so this is where my mouse traps have been going
I think I know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher
and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement
what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet
he lifted up the visor to investigate
there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps
and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse
whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard
during all this time Norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman
a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting
was long passed due
and he was getting mighty cold and hungry
but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard
there you are said the guard as Norman fled inside
but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole Norman sniffed it
he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff
and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught Norman by the tail
are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard
it's just my hobby said Norman
it's just my hobby
oh there having a big party
the guard tossed Norman up on his shoulder
Norman was sure he was being taken to jail
you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze
hooray for trapeze
why I'll be bamboozled cried the guard
I do believe you've won a prize
the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly
here's the winner I found him freezing in the snow
indeed said the head judge
why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze
what is your name my good fellow
and what would you like for your prize
if you please sir my name is Norman
and I'm the doorman downstairs
and I've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught
that's what I'd like best
there's a bust
and another bust
and that's that's a knight with his armor on
yes
the guard led Norman out into the hall
where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum
later that night when Norman returned from returned to his door
he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him
of course Norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese
a present given to him from the warm hearted guard
what a wonderful way to end the day
good night
yay
