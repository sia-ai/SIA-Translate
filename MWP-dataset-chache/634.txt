you don't fight the bull like that do you
you have a little cape
we'll take you out another day

okay
what do you want to play
I'm not playing Indian
why don't you ask Ursula where she got this
no
no
Ursula is Ursula
Adam is Adam
spear is spear
you didn't ask her about those
I think she has an interesting story to tell about those
you did
you must have a big tummy ache
if you ate all of those animals certainly you must have a big tummy ache
I don't want to eat my animals
but I don't want any animals
but I don't want any animals
no you missed my mouth anyway
no
where does that go
which hand
which hand
that hand
the other hand
what's the matter with your finger Adam

scratched it on something
why don't you tell Ursula about the television program you saw last night
a fish
a fish fell down
oh you're not a fish
no
a finger fish
I've seen a whale
in a book
I don't know where the book is now
why did it do that
it's a patrol car
I think it's just skinned a little
scraped
perhaps you hit it against something and some of the skin came off
what do you think
why don't you get it and see what is does
what's the matter
it looks like a friendly animal
what do you think it is
you didn't play much with it
look how nice and soft it is
you don't
why don't we name it something
no you tell me what it is
it's something you've seen
is it as tall as a giraffe
what is the music it's playing
oh tell me why you're frightened
there
isn't it nice and soft
why don't you get your book and see if you see anything that looks like it
huh
it can't really walk
let's look in the book
you don't have what
those are fish
do you think so
look at it carefully
look at it carefully
ask Ursula if that's it is
yes
some people eat snails yes
because they like them
no I don't think I'd like to eat snails
because it's the custom in their country to eat snails
is he friendly
that's what
oh that's church music
what's the name of the song
does it
it's a bug
mhm

I'm not sure that it does anything with the bee
do they have beginning sounds that are alike
what about bird
no
I don't know what kind they are
it's a pretty color isn't it
nothing
it just plays nice music
oh you do
you'll have_to talk to Ursula about that
what shall we do
alright
look at it carefully
perhaps you can find out
I think it would be much more fun if you find out
you look very carefully
okay I'm looking too
I don't know if it's that way
what is this
a house
what kind of a house
I was just putting them on there
you tell me what sound they make as you pick them up
and what
oh you turned into a flower pot too
that's not white that's brown isn't it
you were right at first
white
brown and white
because they were painted that way or made that color
in the factory
oh we we have a factory
where
what do we make in our factory
oh what is that
what is that
look at it carefully
it says gobble gobble gobble
did you

what is that
they just left this
when they were cutting the animal out
they didn't take this off
it's the same kind of thing isn't
that's just something extra
I don't know
you'll have_to ask Ursula
I think you could
she can't see it
mhm
yes probably he'll put them in his mouth
because he likes to put things in his mouth
alright
how shall we do it
do you have something for fences Adam
your fences
I was walking rocking on your leg
oh I'm so sorry
what melted

there's one behind it
oh did they
alright
the lamb's Mother
did you look behind you
is that a baby lamb
no I think it's really a dog
oh you opened it didn't you
yes because they're frightened of the big tractor
because it's so big
Mr farmer don't you have a small tractor
do you have a tractor that's smaller than that one
you mean in here
alright
mhm
yes
not on the farm when the animals are out
because it might run over some of the animals
it might hurt the animals because the tractor's so big
the rest of what
oh there's food for the animals
what is it
oh each one gets it and each one eats it
what is it
yes
sometimes they catch them and eat them
