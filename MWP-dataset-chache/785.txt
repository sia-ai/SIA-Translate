that's called static electricity
how did you see sparks
hey
what if the sparks caught the closet on fire
what would we do then

it just makes light
right
Daddy shouldn't scare you like that
do you want to find it again

I can hear it
nope
did you see some
oh
I was trying to throw it on the stairway

or do you just want to have a pinata
what's a pinata
gets to do what a_lot more times

would you like that
did you tell Mom what we did this morning
you did
did you tell her what you played with
oh come on
tell her what happened
what did they do to the Indians and cowboys

tell Mom why the dinosaurs always won
is that the only reason that the dinosaurs won
I thought there was another one
I thought the dinosaurs were really fast
didn't have time to what
that's right
don't put that in your mouth
this will be good for lunch tomorrow right Abe
corn chowder
you will tomorrow when I tape your hands behind your back open your mouth and pour it down your throat
