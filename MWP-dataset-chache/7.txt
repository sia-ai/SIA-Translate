no
no is a nice response for something that you don't like
okay so we have_to make a decision first when we hear somebody propose something whether we agree with it or no
in this particular case Ross knows that the answer is always no if I say that I want to eat some of his stuff he'll always say no that's because he really doesn't have_to make the decision about whether or not he wants to
