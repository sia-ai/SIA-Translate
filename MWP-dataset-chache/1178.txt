it says that the Machrauchenia was eleven feet tall and looked like a camel with no humps
the Brontotherium says that they had horns and they used to fight each other with their horns
this one says that there were lots_of unusual creatures that roamed the earth many many years ago
it says the woolly mammoth had pretty small ears
that says that the woolly mammoth lived during the Ice_Age
it says that one of the saber+tooth tigers was called a Smiladon
it had long knife like teeth which were over six inches long
the Machrauchenia says that it ate plants
mhm
and a long trunk like nose
wow
achoo
achoo
the Brontotherium says they had a y shaped forked horn on the top of their snout
the Thorahockis says it was about five feet tall and had a long neck and small wings
because the wings were so small they could not use them to fly instead the wings may have helped the bird to maintain balance while it ran on its powerful legs
yummy
huh the giant sloth had long curved claws and fed by stripping leaves with its tongue
but when the giant sloth was on the ground its claws forced the animal to walk on the sides of its feet making movement difficult
yeah
although its slow progress made the giant sloth an easy target for meat eaters its claws served as effective weapons
the giant sloth probably only became extinct about eleven million years ago
interesting
mhm
that is a neat book
yeah
well it says that lots_of interesting creatures roamed the earth millions of years ago
they were the predecessors to lots_of the animals that we see today

so sorry to see you go
mhm
ah let me see
okay hang on
can you ask nicely
please
which one
ah let's see
this one is that's what friends are for do you want that one
that one is oh oop ouch
there's so many books in there it's hard to get out
let me see
really
you want the tooth fairy book
look what I found over here though
the tooth fairy
mhm
okay I can't you know what I can't get that one out because it's too far back
I think that's the everything book
okay well why don't we read the tooth fairy first and then I'll have_to work on digging that other one out
yeah
right
you're right
this is the tooth fairy
she has lots_of teeth
she has lots_of dimes and quarters too
she needs them because when you are asleep she comes and takes away the tooth that you have put under your pillow
and she puts the money there instead
sometimes she forgets and then of course your tooth is still there in the morning instead of the money
that this is because she works so hard
the tooth fairy has to work harder than the Easter bunny because the Easter bunny only works on Easter
the tooth fairy works harder than Santa Claus because there's only one night when Santa goes down all those chimneys but the tooth fairy is busy every night
that's Santa with a big sack of toys
if she forgets to take your tooth one night she usually remembers it the next
she will take your tooth home with her along with all the others she has collected that night
when she gets home the first thing she does with your teeth is to sort them
lower teeth extra teeth bottom teeth teeny teeth very clean teeth
girl's teeth boy's teeth shiny teeth first teeth small teeth
she puts some of the pretty ones in a glass jar on a high shelf in the kitchen she thinks they look nice there
they do look nice there don't they
yeah
pretty
she puts some in the bottom of the fish+bowl her fish are crazy about teeth too
she makes some into necklaces and some into bracelets she has more necklaces and bracelets than anyone
she just loves jewelry
of course every other fairy knows what kind of birthday presents she will get from the tooth fairy
the pathway to her house is paved with teeth
and there are always stars outside her window at night
at least it looks that way because she has hung clothes+lines full of teeth in the sky just in case the real stars don't come out
well it's a pretty decoration I think
oh really
thank you
I do need a little trim
well we'll just pretend
snip snip snip
snip snip snip
snip snip snip
how does it look
great
oh boy
wow
hm
oh my gosh that is so so silly

sorry
each year the tooth fairy has a great big party and all the other fairies come to have refreshments and to play games
wow

um you know what I don't know if she's in this picture the tooth fairy

yeah
they play hopscotch with teeth of course
mhm

there's a jacks contest with teeth instead of jacks and a pin the tooth on the donkey game
the winner gets a prize
it's all wrapped in a box and I think you know what it is
a tooth

do you know why the tooth fairy likes to eat so much
she doesn't have any of her own
but she hopes to grow one some day
just like you
