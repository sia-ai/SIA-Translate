okay so don't destroy the things here okay
thank you Naima
let's see
we have a lot of things to wrap
we need a wrapping strategy
alright
hm
okay now that Daddy's downstairs I'm gonna go get a present for him
that I have in the other room okay
there's sleepy bear
okay
this is a present for Daddy I don't want him to know about it
so we have_to keep it secret
secret secret secret
now what did I do with the scissors
there's scissors
here's tape
okay
okay
you're going to the present wrapping place
excellent does he like to help wrap presents too
can you sit down
I
I'm gonna wrap it right here so put your bottom right here
sit right here
and I'll let you help me
that bear still has bandaids on doesn't he
yeah
okay
this is Daddy's present
just because
I don't want Daddy to know
what it is
let's wrap it in some paper before he comes upstairs again
because I want it to be a secret
because it's more fun
here
you are
okay
you really need a shirt on so you can wear this mic
because I'm just putting the mic on the floor and that's probably not such a good place for it
I know I'll put it right on my pants
closer to you
okay
I'm gonna wrap this for Daddy
I'll let you help put the tape on okay
oh okay
okay
can you fold this edge up
fold that edge up
no not triangles yet
this way first
okay
you've done this
fold this one down
well first we need some tape
presents are more fun if they're kept secret
well I think so anyway
well
people have opinions and that's my opinion
do you need a tissue
there's a box of tissues right there if you need one
oh it was just an itch
I see
okay
do triangles
take the corner this is the corner
and then bring the corner up right here
just bring it all the way up
like right to there
and then fold it down to make the triangle
now take this corner
fold it
right there
and then we made a big triangle here
and now we can tape it
here
good
yep
okay
you just need one
not too much tape
and then rub it after you put it on
okay that's good
this is a present from Mommy to Daddy
I need tags though
hm
well I think I might reuse this tag from last year
whose name is that
do you know
can you read that
read the letters
yep
i
can you sound it out
what does v sound like
in this case it sounds like xxx
xxx and then xxx
this was
I don't know when I made this label it was a long time ago
this is a card
yes
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
the letter xxx
the letter xxx
you know what other letters begin with j
that's our letter for the day
what other letters
begin with
jammed is a good one
yep
yep that can be jammed
that's sometimes what jammed means
how about juicy
and juice
those begin with letter j
Jim
oh gym
that actually begins with g
remember g sometimes sounds like j
it's very confusing I know
I think it is
um
joke
Jew
yes
junior
yes
junior does
jum
jum uh jum isn't really a word actually
I'm attaching
the card onto the present
with the ribbon and the tape like this
whoa
one day a child walked and walked and walked and walked
mm
oh that's your staff
your red staff
what time is it
uh
oh okay
I won't use your red staff
don't unwrap the wrapping paper
are you going to have a bath tonight or a shower tomorrow morning
alright
to take a shower
alright I guess that's alright
in that case why don't we put a
some
a top
a pajama top on you now
because it's almost bedtime
if I bring one out can you put it on by yourself do you think
alright
well you can have a pajama bottom also
oh please don't rip that paper sweetie pie
please leave that alone
do you wanna put on these
pajamas by yourself
let's leave that alone now that you've unwrapped it
because
Mommy and Daddy need
are gonna need to use it
there's your pajama
top and bottom
can you put them on yourself
me
why would I do
why would I wear just bottoms to bed
is that what he
is that what he does
really
is it not working right
do you need help
can I see
can I just look
you know what since you have big kid pants on
just put the tops on for now
don't worry about the bottoms because you're gonna have_to get an
diaper on anyway before you go to sleep
unless your legs are really cold
are your legs cold right now
that's your pajama top
xxx I don't think I'll fit in it
it can fit on you though sweetie
oh you know what
this is actually for you
I forgot that I ordered this
these are some pants for you
you wanna try them on
I hope so because I bought them for you
if they don't fit I might send them back
do you wanna try them on
why don't you try them on and see
just try them on and see if they fit
I got these for you because I thought that since you're gonna be using the potty a_lot more you'd like pants that are easy to get off and on
easy to pull down
especially when
for when you're in school
and you can go to the potty by yourself
yes well the teacher's always there to help you if you need help but
I thought maybe you'd like pants that are easy to get off and on to go to school with
excellent job
excellent
those look very nice
yeah a lot of pants fit you
these are slightly long but that's something that Mommy can fix
in fact maybe I'll fix it soon
let me just
let me just
come here for a sec
just hold still for a sec I wanna see something
I wanna see how much I need to hem them
hem means to
bring them up
further
that's about where I'm gonna hem them I guess
nice pants
you can take them off now
every day
what about
they'll need to be washed won't they
Mommy's gonna hem them and then
that's great they do fit
well hemming is
is a way of making them shorter
I think you have the right idea
you can put that top on now
good
I need some stronger
oh yeah

big kid pants
is he a big kid Naima
I didn't think he was
alright
oh he's wearing the knickies huh

that's a lot of teeth
and which ones are rotten
how many teeth are rotten
are there only certain ones that are rotten
oh dear
let me have a look
oh yeah I see whatchu mean
hm do you think we should just uh
fill the cavity
cavity is a hole in your tooth that you get when your teeth are really rotten
okay
okay
then maybe we better fill it with something
oh
yes that is your name
doctor dentist
doctor xxx
are you doctor xxx Naima xxx
yeah
okay
well dentists use the name doctor in front of their names sometimes
just like for other kinds of doctors
cause a dentist is really a tooth doctor
that's why
what's the patient's name
uhhuh
oh the tool for looking in the mouth is on the floor
can I look in his mouth also
okay
okay Mister_Bear
yeah I'm the assistant
yes oh yes I see that rotten tooth right there
okay
I think we should fill it
we should fill the hole in the tooth
well
that will help the tooth get better
if it's really rotten we might have_to pull it out but I don't think it's that bad
do you
oh we have_to pull it out
mm
hm okay
well
hm we need might need some special other tools for that
can you go find our special tools for pulling teeth out
you know what you might want to use is the
the
whadaya call 'em
tongs
not the toast tongs the metal tongs
d'you know where they are
I don't know actually

you know what we're gonna need to go for a drive in a little while because we don't have any yogurt xxx
we have_to buy yogurt
there's no yogurt in our house except for the baby yogurt that's the flavor that you don't like

or all circles
or all ovals
I'll give you all squares
well this is for gluing on those special Christmas cards
I'll get the glue stick back for you

like that
xxx Naima I have_to make a phone call
write something down
what're you gonna write down
xxx don't you need paper to write something down
