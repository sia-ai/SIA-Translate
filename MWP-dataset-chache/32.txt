what's wrong Mark
now which story do you want to hear about the machines
okay xxx about a long time ago
how did it start
you don't remember the story
well don't you remember part of the first part
uhhuh and what did the cavemen have
uhhuh and what things didn't they have
tell me some things that they didn't have
yeah
and what did they do with those big thick sticks
mhm know what those things were called
clubs
yeah
yes they are
okay you wanna hear some more stories about them
sure that's another tool they made they took a piece of skin from an animal
a real long piece and they put it into a stick from a tree
and then at the very back they put a stone
and they pulled it back back and then it shot
shot it like that
or sometimes they'd wrap it around slinging it around and let it fly
uhhuh and that's called a s they're both called slingshots okay
in the old days yes
there were many enemies to the people sometimes there were other people who were enemies and sometimes wild animals
did you know about that
that's true do you think they fought with dinosaurs
no not with really
that's a mistake
the dinosaurs were long before when the dinosaurs walked on the earth there were no people
no but saber+tooth tigers and wooly mammoths did woolly mammoths lived with with the caveman and they were huge
yes they were real they were real
you think so
that's just in Flintstones
how do you know
oh they were still just monkeys
may maybe so okay now
so they were there
okay now you wanna hear the rest of the story
okay now the first thing they did those first thing those people did Ross when they wanted to eat they would have_to hunt and kill an animal and then eat the flesh that's right and that's of course a_lot_of work first of all right
and also kinda yucky right
okay
but now how did they get out_of the caves out_of the stone age what did they do
do you have any idea
no
to get out_of the caves
no
you know what they did
that was very important
the most important thing of all
fire
they learned how to make fire
would you guys know why is that so because they used the fire to make to make iron
iron and bronze and metals so they could make metal they used hot they took the dirt
and they burned hot hot fires and the hot fires made the dirt into strong knives
and into guns and into a uh shovels
no they could make shovels they took things and they made big tools with the fire that's why fire was very important Ross and Mark did you know that Marky
what
why
then they could dig caves but you know what else they could do with a shovel
dig holes for plan to plant plants
or they could make a palace they could build big buildings you see
mhm
mhm
mhm
right
right and so these people worked very hard they made these tools and now you know what they could do next
they started to make machines do you know what kind of machines they could make
first they could make machines to lift things like big pulleys and things like so you can lift them up on top of the building and they made big huge wagons so they could carry things you heard about the wheel do you know what the wheel does
the wheel makes it so you can roll wagons with big wheels can roll down the hill
mhm
we're getting close to cowboys okay
and then all first we have_to go through do you remember Robin hood time
okay Robin hood had arrows right
and he had swords
and they had guns
oh they just starting they were just starting making the ssh they didn't have guns yet but they did have swords
forest weapons
okay
okay now came
right
no
because they didn't have gun powder yet
gun powder came from
middle ages
okay well they had the forest weapons and they could build a_lot_of shovels and axes but they still didn't know how to make big machines and then came the time of the great machines and s people started building machines to do lift
oh okay well oh and there was armor I forgot to tell you about armor
a knights in armor used to have masks on their head made of steel Marky do you know like He_Man and Man_at_arms have masks made of steel and they have all covered with steel
but those are still not machines they're just weapons and tools okay
think of a machine what is a machine
yeah
okay
okay and then people said hey if we can make shovels then we can make guns and knives I bet we can make something really really fancy
bicycles
they could make bicycles and they could make all sorts of little machines called clocks they started to make clocks and all little pieces started to move around and then they made machines to cut up to cut up to grind flour and make flour and machines to go out in the fields and pick the cotton and then they made cars Ross and Mark they built cars
right now we get in to our time and they make cars
and they started to make boats with engines
and the engines went vrrooom vrrrooom and they really had machines okay
and then what happened next see if you can tell me the rest of the story
what else did they make
no rivers are not machines
man didn't make rivers
no God made wood
yeah what about the things that go up into outer space
yeah those are big machines
