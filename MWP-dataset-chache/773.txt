these colors
these colors
I already knew that
okay

you can use your paint brush with these too
uhhuh
okay suit yourself
who
uhuh Mommy and Daddy did
uhhuh Santa_Claus got you those paints
and Mommy and Daddy got you these paints
what are you doing with that pen
you're using a pen and a paint brush at the same time
I bet that's going to be a strange picture
no that one's just thick
it still works alright
that's alright
it won't stain your hand
I can wash it off when you're done
because your shirt we can't wash as fast as your hands get it
smashed up
I don't know what made those get so watery
they still work alright though
what are we going to eat on Thanksgiving Abe
uhhuh what else
uhhuh
cranberries
Abe have you ever tasted cranberries

I really think you are an artist
are you done with that picture
okay you sure have been working on it for a long time

oh you can
but we ran out_of fingerpainting paper
so you can use the paintbrush instead
good

are you all through
yeah
aw we better go take your shirt off and put it in the water to soak
after I wash it
not when it's cold outside
yeah you have_to
because I don't want you to get too cold
Thanksgiving is on Thursday and Christmas is December twenty fifth
so Thanksgiving and Christmas will both be over December twenty sixth
because
what
Charlie_Brown's on at seven
uhhuh
Abe don't touch this cloth when your hands are dirty
yes they look very dirty

what was the other something
what was the other something
oh a bear went in and a bear came out
for snakes right
he wanted to eat snakes right
I bet that all of the snakes in that country were all crying
I don't know if they really do
but if they do they would if they were all getting eaten up
is there anything else in there
it sure looks that way
where can we put our angels
I think there's some in that glass
I'll get you some

uhhuh
no that's Dacron quilt batting
and that's cotton
it's not edible
where's the little nativity scene
Abe I asked you not to pick that up
it's head was drying
where'd you put that little nativity scene we had
someone was too strong
and they pulled it off
yeah there were just two that were broken
and it just so happened that you picked up the two that were broken and rebroke them
I know that it was an accident though
no I think they have_to be standing up
he can't stand up
I think the cotton's too thick
I'll have_to fix it
where did you put the little nativity scene Abe
well see if you can find it
well try and remember where you put it
I don't see it either
what does
how come
that's not a very good reason
it looks like a little piece of wood
what else do we have_to use to decorate
no that's for around the Christmas tree
white
I don't know why are you saying white
do you want me to light that candle
what kind of cake did you want to make
well afraid not
because you'd want to eat it
but you didn't eat your beans
so you don't get any snacks tonight right
oh that's just a candle to burn
it's not to put on a cake
it's scented bayberry
it smells like bayberry
we can put it in that little candle holder that we got
no Abe it's not a birthday candle
it's not a candle for a cake
let me show you
it's a candle to make the room smell better
it smells like bayberry
uhhuh
that's where we put it
we put it in the candle holder
I wanna melt some wax
so_that it'll stick to the wax
does it smell like bayberry
strawberry
we do have some strawberry candles
it's in the back of the closet Abe
we can't see it
it's underneath a_lot_of stuff
we'll look for it some other time
I'm going to cut it in half
that way we can have two candles
I'll relight it
there that works a_lot better
right there on the table
after this one burns down we'll burn the other one
hm
what do we need much more fire for
I think one fire's plenty don't you
this other one
I'm gonna store it in this drawer
and we'll use it when this one burns down
we'll use it after this one's burned down far enough
yeah we have those golden angels
I don't know exactly how to hang them though
how do you think we should hang them
do you think we should hang them from here
are you sure about that
a man hung a guy from a wall
oh put them in a roll
I thought that we'd hang them on this ribbon
whatta you think
Abe do you like them here
oh you want me to put one real low so_that you can see it
just for Abe
the icicles
they look like real icicles don't they
they're all there aren't they
go ahead Abe
what's the problem
what are you going to do with it if you get it out
do you want to hang it up
lower especially for Abe
let me see one
like that
yeah but look
the ribbons much too big isn't it
make it real thin so_that it can fit through the tiny hole
do you think your gun is a scissor or a knife
yep
I sure did
why didn't you come take a bath with me
do you want to help me take out the trash
uhhuh
no I'm going right now

Abe do you want me to make you a huge bow
I'll make you a really long one
because I asked you
and you said
yes
here it is
uhhuh
I found the nativity scene Abe see
I'm going to put it right in the middle of the angels
so it'll look like the angels are singing to the people right
was I playing with your guns
uhhuh
no all I did was take the trash out
it's pretty chilly out there
how'd you do that Abe
I pulled on your pants
I pulled on your pants
just to see what you'd do
and you said
why'd you do that
what'd you kill
oh the turtle wasn't in the shell
well what happened to the shell then
oh what happened to the shell when you shot it
did you blow the fire out
your gun got water in it
was your gun full of wind

you're through
I'm putting this box back in the closet
because we don't want it down on the table
Stan you should have seen Andy today
what happened
he got his hair cut really short didn't he Abe
well sometimes he gets his hair cut very short
and then he looks different
and it takes us a while to get used to him with short hair
so he looks different
to get his hair cut
because I cut your hair
and I'm a_lot better than any barber
he already found a new shell
that was really fast
that was really fast
well why did the cowboy say
okay kook
I think he'd really be happy if you did that
was he okay
I guess I'll do the dishes
you're not going to do the dishes
you're not going to do the dishes
who said you were too little
you're too short
putting this jar away
because it's in the way
why what
I wrote Abe on there
no I wrote Abe and fox
because you said that was a fox right
I wrote Abe
