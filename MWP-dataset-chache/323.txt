now this is his home
let's say everybody gets there own home
where's his is his home
each one gets a little money
oh so just the plant eaters get them
yeah so should he get one then
I think so
so just the plant eaters get them
and then they can buy things or what are they supposed to do with the money
they don't really get to keep them right
now this is a cool thing
so I think in their new land maybe they want more trees
he's hungry he's gonna eat this whole tree
he's gonna eat actually all the trees he says I am so hungry
should he get to eat all those trees or should he share them
that would be nice
what if he says this is my tree
cool so they all got one
that's a good idea
well what if this guy comes and tries to scare them all away
he says I wanna eat you
I wanna eat you
and then what happens Matty
and you scoot over there
you know to get away from that mean one
is this like that conatour or is he more like a tyrannosaurus
yeah I don't really know what kind he is
he's kind of strange
look at his back well what do you think about his back
he's got a weird back I think
all the money can go
here why don't you scoot over sweety
so it's if they need one then they just have_to ask and then they wait their turn and then they get one
well what if he pretends to be a plant eater
what if he says can I have one I'm a plant eater
yeah I want one too
we're plant eaters
what would you say
what if the dinosaur tried to eat this
yeah that's what I was thinking
what if the dinosaur wants to eat the money
oh you're just gonna hide the money
what if he starts chasing you because they really want that money
hey you know when I was talking to Ryan earlier today he was telling me that he saw Erin
he saw Erin
where'd you see Erin
I saw her in town
in downtown Fredonia
at the store
oh at the store
do you remember doing things with Erin
there is one thing I remember that would happen when you would be with Erin
do you want to tell Ryan what happened to one of your um sandals
you lost a sandal
how'd ya lose it
oh yeah
okay and then what happened
how did you loose your sandal in the wagon
oh you just dropped it out
did it fall off your foot
it was a mystery
and then we looked all over for it but we never found the sandal
oh no
what else did you and Erin used to do
you did
you used to play the chase game with Erin
well tell Ryan how you used to play the chase game
he doesn't know the chase game
okay
well you gotta tell him you gotta tell him Boo
because he doesn't know if he can't see you so you gotta stay here and just say how you do it
you just run
okay so you're the runner and then what am I supposed to do
I just run with you
what happens if I catch you
oh they're like the winner
now how am I supposed to grab you when I catch you
like this
got ya is that how you do it
that sounds like a fun game
I don't know
maybe this dinosaur ate it
oh there's some in there
I don't know how many were there
good job
thank you for counting my money
they're yours
well then my finger will fall through
will my finger fall off
oh is that my job okay
let me see this money here want me to catch them
put my hand right there
now you know your tortoise kind of looks like a dinosaur
yeah he does
now is he a meat eater
plant eaters
oh okay that'd probably be a good idea
a person's head
what does your tortoise eat
tomatoes and lettuce
that sounds good
sweet ones
sweet potatos
yeah you know what that one day what did daddy let you do with the sweet potato
he let you cut it with a knife yes
was it a little plastic one
well what kind of knife
a real knife yeah
one that you use to butter things
Matty does a really good job taking care of his turtle
what do you have_to do to take care of your turtle
you cook his food
oh my gosh
uh oh that one's gone
how many do we have left now
I think we just have four now because one's lost
do you have one Matty
how many'd you get just one
yeah
do you think that this could be from the second Harry Potter movie
it could be you know why because are there any new people that we don't know
and here's Harry
who else do you see that you know
that's Hermione
you know who this is
Voldemorte
you know this does say that is from the the a slime chamber which I don't remember a slime chamber from the first movie
do you
no
I think this is from the second movie let's see
it says Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone so I'm not sure but I don't remember a slime chamber
I wonder I'm not sure if Ryan ever saw Harry Potter
I saw the end of it and that's all
what happens in Harry Potter
he has not seen that movie he does not know anything about it
no
is it a funny movie
you don't know about Harry Potter either
what happened to our Harry Potter video
it got thrown away
how'd that happen
oh okay
yeah he was having what were you doing that was not so good at school
hurting kids at school so then we had to put the Harry Potter video away
this one right here I'm trying to get him out
I didn't realize they were all tied in here
hey I have a question for you though before we play with these
what is something that you did since the last time I saw you that maybe you got some candy or something
oh there's that thing
do you want to take that part out too
you can take it out
so do you know what Ryan asked you
what is something that you did since we last saw Ryan that you got some candy
so did you do something a couple of days ago where maybe you dressed up
yeah what was that
oh it's called Halloween
what'd you do
you did did you get lots_of candy
how'd you get it did you just find it
nope what did you have_to do
oh and they just give you candy then
oh you do
well that sounds like fun
what was your costume
what was your costume
a fireman oh boy
yeah we can open that one
yeah it looks like there is something that might go on the back of it
we'll have_to see if there's any directions or anything
oh yeah see I think you can make him fly
yep I think that part goes right in there
so you think that it must be from the second Harry Potter movie because they did not have this in the first movie
so that might be a good idea
so you know I was trying to remember the Harry Potter movie too
it was a while ago since we saw it
how do you put this in the back of here
I wonder does it have does it show a little bit
it looks like you put it in oh you had the idea Matty
it seems like it would go in here I think that was a good idea
well maybe it just sticks in there a little bit
now what is this game what is he doing her even
he's playing hookage
he's trying to what's he got in his hand
do you see anything that he's got in his hand
so how do you play Quidditch
what are you supposed to do in Quidditch
you have_to get the golden snitch
so what happens to Harry in the movie
you're trying to what
what do you think that's for
I don't know I think that one goes for that guy
was there a little ball that went with him
I'm not sure
these are some very interesting things
there is a ball there okay
what are you supposed to do with the ball do you remember
oh it's stuck in there okay
okay what're you supposed to do
you have_to stretch it like this maybe
wow oh I see that's how you make him fly
what do you think does that look like flying
cool I see so that's how you do it
and then George it seems that he just rides on this
do you think you would like to fly like that
I think I might be a little scared
you would
the ball is stuck in there
it is stuck in there
did you get it out
no it is stuck
so when Harry Potter plays Quidditch how does he win the game
he tries to get the golden snitch
well what happens do you remember when we saw the movie what happened when he's flying on his broom and he was trying to catch the golden snitch what happened to the broom
do you remember when it was shaking
yes I don't know if you saw that part actually
it was shaking because of Voldemorte right
well he's got_to try and hit the ball through the hoop
can you do it
umkay here I'll be the batter go ahead
alright now you've got_to hit it through the hoop
that seems pretty hard doesn't it
almost
me neither what is that thing
that silly he does not have that in the movie does he
very interesting
there were a whole bunch of things like I don't remember this guy from Harry Potter do you
no way I don't remember him at all
there making up all these different characters
so we went trick or treating what else did you do
there was another thing that you did since you saw Ryan it was something for where you were walking and you had your costume on
do you remember that
you were walking and you had your costume on and Roman was Buzz Light Year
what were you guys doing when you were walking
you know
what
you know something we can do
I don't know where did it go
oh there it is
what's that
it's just a raisin oh okay
so that is what we need right
so how do we do it show me
oh cool
so we had one day where you went to the parade and then you also went to somebody's Halloween party
who's Halloween party
who's the girl in your class who had the Halloween party
so you were in a parade
I've never been in a parade before
what was that like
I think we're learning that he is distracted
he can't do things sometimes
do you want to play with these toys Matty
alright so I'm gonna be George
my job is to hit the ball through the hoop
but now I have_to run away because who's gonna be chasing George
who would be chasing George and then he would be scared
could be
so George is gonna help help Voldemorte's chasing me
so he's gonna hide over here
so what's Harry Potter gonna do
is he gonna go save him he might
what do you think do you think he should try to go save George
okay let's do that
so George is hiding because Voldemorte is coming
so he's hiding and he says Harry help me help me
so what does Harry do
he goes and helps him
you want me to fly him
on to the what
uh oh he's stuck
yeah that's what happened poor Harry got stuck
okay so maybe let's just have him fly you can fly without this part right
so how's he gonna go and save George
and then George would say is it safe to come out
yes
well okay I'll come out but wait wait wait Voldemorte's right here
Harry come here Voldemorte is going to bother us you gotta come here
okay now we're trapped
what're we gonna do how're we gonna get out
back up alrighty
so how are we gonna get out without Voldemorte seeing us
just fly
well I'll follow you Harry you seem to have a good idea
that's a lot of flying
where is he landing now
he's landing right on the tractor
now can they drive the tractor
oh well that's a cool idea
how about they fly so they make the tractor fly too
cool wouldn't that be neat if they could have a flying tractor
you don't remember that guy in it either
the other sheet
it's by Ryan
yeah I didn't see that guy in the movie
that's the guy that's one of the guys who gives him his money
no no no he's one of the professors he's one of the teachers
he actually I remember him from the movie
I think he stands on that because he's really short
you don't remember him or that either
it's silly that they have in there hand
so that's what he's doing in order to try to get away from Voldemorte
oh I see
well let's see
he's a mean one
yeah he's mean too you're right
he does not like Harry Potter very much
he's not evil like Voldemorte though
I don't remember this guy oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah you remember who this guy is
what is this game what do they use for this
remember when they're playing chess
I can fly faster than you Harry I'm a faster flyer than you
you're trying to hide in the guitar
is that a good hiding spot
let's see if we can find a good hiding spot for him
oh that's a good idea
is that a good place for them to hide
what's going on with your thing
they're getting stuck in there
where's your George is he missing
I was afraid George was missing
so they were hiding from Voldemorte for a while right
now what are they gonna do
I know is he is he stuck now
is he flying upside down almost
you know I was gonna tell you Ryan does not know about somebody that is coming to visit us
who's coming to visit us in a couple of weeks
can you tell him about them coming
where do they live
how many ways do they live
they live far they live in Wisconsin
wow and they're coming to visit you
how are they gonna get here
they're actually not gonna fly do you know any other way to get here
yep they're gonna drive
what are they gonna do when they are here
fly with broomsticks
what would you like them to do while they're here
you don't see that thing on the back of this broomstick
I'm not sure what that's for oh maybe it so you can help it stand
so he can be like catching the Quidditch
so we should think about what we wanna do when grandma and grandpa come
didn't you make a list today what was list about at school today
going on a trip right so tell me what you put on that list
okay
so what did you actually put on the list what kinds of stuff do you need to bring on the trip
everything
like your turtle would you bring your turtle with you
oh it's a tortoise
there are things I can connect these too
really
you've been watching a new movie this week that also Ryan never saw
well what's that movie about
oh I think I might know something that it's about
remember one time I brought some other toys over to play with
do you remember what they were
you remember what Ryan brought you to play with that one day
it was a long time ago
yeah is that maybe what that movie is about
where are the dinosaurs going in the movie
remember where is the place that they gotta try to go
the great
the great valley
why did they have_to go to the great valley
was there something maybe sad that happened in the Land Before Time
what about xxx mommy
you don't remember
what happened to his mother in the movie
who's your favorite dinosaur in that movie
the scariest meat eater's your favorite
you know who I liked in that movie too was I can't remember if I got the name right but was it Peatry
and what did Peatry do how did Peatry get around
stand on somebody's head
Little Foot's head
what is Peatry supposed to do
isn't it right at the end where's he able to fly right
wait is that just the broomstick
oh my gosh it flies all by itself
Matty come back please
because we're playing still in here
so what were we talking about I forget
oh so we were watching that one movie
and then there's Little Foot and there's also Peatry who else is in that movie
I remember Duckey now
what does Duckey always say
Duckey has something silly to say
yuppie tree
we also watched remember the one that was Jurassic Park
ooh what was that movie like
people were getting eaten by the scary dinosaurs yep it's true
because we never saw the movie before we got the toy
what movie is that toy from
Dinosaurs there's another movie you call Dinosaurs
that's the name of the one movie we've been watching a_lot of dinosaur movies right
I heard something about The Land Before Time what did the meat eater try to do
now where did those leaves come from Matty I haven't seen those before
I know it seems like it's getting older it's not holding up real well
where did we laminate them
the school
well now that we've had Halloween what's the next big holiday
where you get toys what would you say it's
not today is it Christmas today
no
how about the next day nope
what is usually going on outside when it is Christmas time
what do you do in the snow that's fun
play what do you play
sometimes I build something in the snow do you know what that is
snowman
you did that a couple times
well how would you make his face and his arms and everything
oh so you thin the snow around to make his body up sometimes I would put a carrot for his nose
Dr Juice
I want to hear about the shaving cream stuff
Dr Juice shaving cream can you say what you actually did today with the shaving cram
on your arms too huh
now what were you supposed to do with the shaving cream
just play with it

you did have toys in it
so what else did you do today at school
you did what
did you say you wore mittens
oh you were mixing stuff
like acorns
can I see this acorn
oh that is a cute one
does Ryan know about the story about what happened with the long acorn
remember that one that was long
do you wanna tell him about that story about what happened with the long acorn
the one that was long that was from your classroom
you forget
maybe he doesn't want to tell that story because it was one that he borrowed and he was not supposed to take it
oh yep
so we had to bring it back
because it was not our acorn right
do you wanna talk about what we are going to do tonight what thing we are going to get at the store
a green sweater
oh I like green
that's my favorite color

it really is
he loves green
so we're gonna get a green sweater and then what else are we gonna get because we had some ideas about when grandma and grandpa are here
so what do we need to get
well that's true we do definitely have_to get food for when grandma and grandpa are here but what was something that we were going to get
here I'll show you what it looks like
here ready
okay you set it all up in a big square and you put the little pieces in it and you take a little hammer
remember what game is that
Don't Break The Ice
now how do you play that game
okay
pound
pound on the guy
oh pound on the ice oh okay
that sounds like a pretty fun game
how do you win the game
pounding the ice
are you supposed to hit that guy in the middle
so the person who wins is the one who does not hit that guy down right
Marissa was hitting the guy down
well yeah she didn't know how to play the game
but you know what how did we even learn about the Don't Break The Ice game
where did we go
oh to his birthday party
what did you do there
that sounds like fun

yep they were nice horses
and then what else did we do at the party
well then he had a cake
what happened with the cake

what did you do
why are you showing me that
I didn't notice that at the party
I don't remember that
no don't do that that's gross
do you need a tissue
you're gonna watch daddy
what's daddy doing
he's raking the leaves in the what
Dr Weist won't believe this
he's raking the leaves and what's going on
I know I can't believe it
he's gonna think that's so funny
so what should we play with today
do you wanna play this game
oh you wanna play this game
okay
you'll have_to tell me how to play this game
alright so show me what do we gotta do first
take all the letters out okay
and then should we turn them over so we can actually see them
that looks like a fun game
let's turn them all over
all of them are almost done
oh yeah there's a lot of them
what do you think about grandma and grandpa do you think they would like to play this game too when they come
this one
yep
they probably would
you what
those are numbers
those are all different numbers
you have_to find the letters that would go with the numbers
now let's see what should we start with
we got them all
do you know what
what letter's this one
you're close
you know what it's a P for
for Percy
so where's Percy that will match that one
do you see Percy
do you remember what color Percy is
green that's right
but actually that's not it because those don't fit together
Percy is I see him actually
where is he
should we put it aside and do a different one since we can't find that one
who's this guy
Dr Juice no who's this guy
Sir Top'm Hat so Sir Top'm Hat should start with S
so let's see where's are S one
oh that's close that's a Z
you got the S good job
does that fit
yeh we did it
you found that one before I did
that's pretty good
do you wanna do Annie
what's Annie start with
it's A
do you see another A
I was noticing maybe that it was under your foot
isn't that silly
so I wonder if Ryan knows what we're gonna be doing when grandma and grandpa come
what kinds of things are we gonna do when they visit
we're gonna do that
I'm not sure they wanna do that
you're still looking for Percy huh
oh it doesn't fit in that one
can I give you a hint
now you got it
you do it on the floor
what are you gonna do with all these
oh you're gonna count the pieces
that's a good idea
okay do you know what letter this one is
close
it's a U for umbrella
so where's an umbrella
do you see an umbrella anywhere
nowhere
umbrella where are you
you gonna ask God to help you find the umbrella
oh did he help you
oh look at that
did he help you
no
you just found it all by yourself
you'd like it to be upside down
alright there you go
that's the way you think it's supposed to be
okay how about let's do oh you wanna do that one
okay that's a this is the same letter that starts Vinnie's name
what letter is it
V right
very good
so where's a V
it's supposed to be V for viaduct
now viaduct is a thing that remember the mean train he crashed off of the viaduct
so do you know do you see one of those pictures where he fell off
well that's close
that's gonna be a quarry
but it kind of looks like that
it sorta looks like a bridge thing
well let's see is this it no
is this it no
is this it
does that look right
and you can also see if the words look the same
viaduct viaduct that's it
viaduct I know that's a word that we don't say that often
viaduct oh how many syllables
how many
three good job
viaduct
now what are we supposed to do with this
is this like a road block
ten we're moving along
now what letter's this one
can you guess what that is
what's the letter
yeah it's for cookie
it's C
twelve man oh man you got it
should we do Z for zig_zag
where's the zig_zag
whatchur looking for's a road that is curvy
do you see any roads
where was that one
where was that
over there okay
this is actually not the zig_zag
see this is not the word zig_zag but you had this one see
zig_zag
zig_zag z
okay keep going
I don't think he can see you Matty or hear you
oh yes daddy sees you
okay are we gonna do another one or what's the next step
okay what letter's this one
take a look at it
you got it
but what's the letter's name
three close
that's an E
what's this one
M yeah but what is M is for Mavis
I do not know who Mavis is
it must be one of the trains
where's one of the trains that has
yeah you got it
Mavis yeah I never heard of her
what kind of car what kind of train does Mavis look like she is
does she look like a steam engine or a diesel
yeah I think she's a diesel
okay do you wanna do some more
alright what letter's that one
if we flip it over what letter
W yep
well the word W is supposed to be for whistle where's the whistle
hey that sounds like a whistle yep
this is the whistle that's for the top of the train
so when you were at school today did you have turkey today at school
when did you have turkey at school
a different day
what else did you have besides turkey
so one thing you didn't like it was made out of apple
was it like a pie or something
a cake
it was something you eat
well what was wrong with it
did it taste weird or did it look weird
it looked weird
you know what letter that is
X yep
yeah that's at the end
so X is for box
because there's an X at the end of the word box
do you see a box anywhere
yeah that's it
so how is your tortoise doing by the way
she's doing good
you found a little toy that he would like
what did we do with the toy
oh yeah
did you get that
no no no that doesn't fit
close because that is yellow but remember this is J J is for Jane and Jane's a train and Birdie's a bus
I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing
Ryan does not know what movie we went to see on Sunday
the new Harry Potter movie
did you like it
it did
yeah it had some mean spiders it did
but you know what you didn't even see the mean spiders because why
because why
because he was sleeping thankfully
oh Sammy what did Sammy just do
he wrecked it
I think he maybe wanted to play
so what was that new Harry Potter movie like
besides the scary spiders what else was in it
what's the funny part that happens at the beginning with something with the car in the Harry Potter movie
oh but he does not know
you can't show him you've gotta tell him
oh it was flying
um hm
and then what happened to the car
it got stuck in a live tree
yeah and what did the tree do to the car
it was eating it
what happened to Harry and what's his friend's name
right
so what happened with Harry and Ron
they just walked in super fast before the train hit them
yep that was a good idea
there is another funny part too at the beginning
what happened to the cake
do you remember something funny that happened with the cake
it did
oh boy that is a funny part
it was and what happened with the cake after it was flying
it fell on somebody's head on this lady's head yep
he's just on the side
can you hear him
I think he might be sweeping the leaves out by the front
do you wanna finish this game
whatchu got there
let's see yellow car starts with Y
do you see any Y's
so do you see a Y anywhere
yep you got it
how come they got a yellow car
what color car would you choose
you'd choose a green car
like the kind that we have or a different one
yeah green cars are cool
we got a big line of them there don't we
do you wanna try
you're not sure
okay let's start at the beginning and we'll see how high you can go
okay just start
yeh good job
that is some good counting
yeah good job
so this is a quarry this is where they dig out the rocks
now this starts with Q
do you see another Q anywhere
Q Q Q where are you

Q Q Q where are you
alright let's check
is this a Q

oh my gosh we found it
oh you're gonna try to count all those
let's do a couple more and then we'll count them again
okay we got a couple left here
how about here's J for James
do you see the one that has James on it
do you wanna do that
okay what letter
yeah it's the same letter as for Lilly's name
L is for lighthouse
do you see a lighthouse anywhere
what movie do they have a lighthouse
you're right
Harry Potter right
you're trying to pick it up
what is that
some fur
I thought it was a worm
it's a worm it's a worm
it's not a worm
it's fur huh
whose fur do you think that is
Sammy's
you want that on your head huh
do you have_to go to the bathroom
are you sure
okay L for lighthouse
do you see the lighthouse
you got it
where do they have lighthouses
do you know
where do they tend to have lighthouses by what
by the lake or the ocean
or by your head sure
did Ryan ever hear the story of how we went to the ocean this summer
well that's a very true thing
we did drive and drive and drive and drive to go to the ocean that's true
well what was the ocean like
what's it like there
you were picking up crabs
just your daddy
how come you weren't
oh I would probably be afraid they'd pinch me too
but we did do something that we picked up and we were very helpful
remember what did we do with the little clams we saw
oh you threw them in the water
that was nice
because we did not want them to get dried out
yeah
so we saved them
so what is the ground like near the ocean
and a lot of what
and some ladders
letters at the ocean
I don't remember seeing any of those
but I do remember that there was something that when we don't have our shoes on we can feel it under our feet when you're at the ocean
what is it
rocks yeah we did step on some rocks
yeah what is it
oh he hurt his hand
oh you did
how'd you hurt your hand
you don't know
well I hope it feels better
it just happened today
I'm not sure what's up with that
I don't ever remember seeing it
I think it's new
so what'd you got there in your hands

so what is the first letter of Harold's name
it starts with H
do you see any H's anywhere
you're pretty good at this game
how'd you get so good at this game
we don't usually play it
we've only tried to play it once or twice
oh yeah
and then he actually ah we did remember we did not really play it before
sometimes he would just take them all and mix them up right
but now you have a very nice line of them
so let's see we've got just a couple left
do you wanna do Birdie
Birdie starts with B
do you see any Bs
I don't wanna play the light saber game that's a mean game
we have all these other kinds of things you can do okay
do you wanna talk about this
what is this thing anyway
it scares trains away
but yeah we don't know if it works yet because it's true we haven't yet seen a train
but what do you gotta do when a train comes with this
oh you shake it
I did not know that trains were scary
how do you know that trains need to be scared away
the drivers will be scared
oh how come they will be scared
oh they're gonna think it's a meat eater
then I could see why they would be scared
you're pretending there is a slide
is it gonna fall threw
you know Ryan hasn't we haven't seen Ryan since before someone came to visit us
yeah who came to visit you again
you're grandma who else
they did
well that sounds like it was fun
what were some of the things that you did with your grandma and grandpa
you did
who won
oh wow so you played it a lot of times huh
two times
okay
yeah because one time he won and one time grandpa won and one time he didn't win so one time grandpa didn't win so actually that is two times
yep
just twice they played
what else did we do while grandma and grandpa were here
do you remember
where was one place we went
oh yeah
and Niagara on the Lake
you remembered that name too that's right
what did you get at Niagara on the Lake
there's something right behind you got
oh I see it
you got can I see that for a second
you got this
wow that is pretty neat
and you got it at Niagara on the Lake huh
what did we do at Niagara Falls Boo
you forget
you walked and walked and walked huh
well some of the time you weren't walking what were you doing
playing in the mud yeah
a little bit just a little bit
I remember that
say excuse me Boo
so we did we had a nice time
so what did we do some of the time when we were home with grandma and grandpa
oh my what is that
can you bring that over here
I don't know if Ryan has ever seen that
yeah what is that
what is that
hey I have another quick question
what did you see at Niagara Falls
did you see anything that was kinda like big and was
Matty don't knock that over please
we just spent a long time cleaning your room didn't we
you can carry that I just don't want that pushed all over the floor
you wanna do this
yeah what is this over here that you got
I have not seen that before
oh yeah
let's look
oh I see your what
and you see my eye too
so let's see do you wanna do this or do you want to play something different
okay let's play something different
you wanna play with the big blocks okay that's fine
what do you think about that
are you gonna bring it over here please so we can play because otherwise Ryan would not be able to use any of them
okay
that's a lot of blocks
I don't mind if they're dumped but are you gonna be wanting to pick them up later
no
are you gonna help pick them up later
who put them all away before
you did yes you put all the blocks away before
you need all the circles
well I will do it
I dumped them so I will clean them up okay
some of the big ones
hey you know I wonder if Ryan knows what we've been doing in the kitchen
there's this thing on the refrigerator and it has little doors
what's that for
um huh each day what
each day it is what
um huh the right day then what
you're trying to make a top
I know it's hard isn't it to try and lean them in like that
so each day you gotta open a door
what's the calendar counting down for
what's it until how many days until what
that's right
oh
so what happens at Christmas anyway
you can't do it
it's hard to build that on that way
I think it is hard to put the roof on too
I think what'd you think about this idea
let's build up the sides and then we'll find like a blanket or something or a piece of paper or something for the roof
let's try to see if we can build it up super high just on the sides and we'll put the roof on later okay
well then we gotta put something else
what would be a good thing to cover the whole roof because we gotta cover the whole thing the blocks aren't long enough to cover it
that's okay
there we go
something else like what
do you see something else that would work
there's some paper in the basement yeah I don't know if I wanna go down in the basement
what's something else that's made out of paper though that would work
you see some paper up there
oh what's that
hey that works good
excellent
now is this actually your daycare
this could be your daycare building right
because it has the daycare thing on it
cool what are those
if they have a fire
um hm
like a big fireplace you mean
yeah
and it comes out of the what
do you remember what it's called
