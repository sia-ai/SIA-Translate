what happened to the old one that was shaped like a turtle
you don't remember it huh
oh well when we left North Dakota we gave it to a baby
remember that
yeah that was a long time ago
that was nice
oh yeah the baby needed one and we were moving
it was so big right Matty
that was hard
do you remember that
you're thinking about it huh
you used to like that sandbox

they look like little houses to me
this is so interesting there's all kinds of stuff
we can do play dough we have a whole baby house
what'd you wanna do
do you wanna draw
you want to play this
okay
what is that
oh look oh I'm so hungry
can I eat this
let me see
this play dough oh it's too hard
I don't think we're gonna be able to use it
how do you think it got hard
cause we didn't play with it the other time
yeah sometimes it gets hard when someone leaves it out if they leave it out in the air you know it has to be closed up in the container
are you gonna eat that
oh you're gonna put it on a little tiny ice cream cone
what kind of ice cream is this
tomato
it kind of looks like that doesn't it
now did you tell Ryan what we're what we are thinking about doing today after we after we are done here
yeah this one's really hard
yeah I dunno about that
we'll have_to get some new play dough
yeah I don't think we can do that
so what do you have_to ask Daddy when you get home
nonalds is Mcdonald's
okay
why are you interested why not Burger King
what's going on with Mcdonalds
toys there what kind of toys do they have going on there

oh um Shanty
okay
how about the bear
you're sure he's there but you don't know for sure
I don't know I didn't really notice
I haven't been there to Mcdonald's with you getting them
so how do you if I just go there will they give me one then
okay okay maybe I will do that
they're cool but you have_to get the chicken meal you're right about that
well actually Matty you could get hamburger too or cheeseburger or chicken
we just always choose chicken cause you like it best
you know Ryan doesn't know about the very interesting thing that you did this weekend where you went with your daddy
well I'll say the name and then you tell Ryan what it's about okay
orchestra
really
what else did they have that was interesting when they had the music going on
what else was on
movies right
what kind of movies
he does
it was cartoons like Tom and Jerry and remember how they used to do a lot of mean things in those cartoons
oh yeah
we don't watch those cartoons but that was happening to be with orchestra
so the mice had so the mouse had a knife huh to cut the cats down
well Tom the cat the cat is named Tom and Jerry is the mouse
that's just their names
Ryan used to watch those when he was smaller
mhm
yeah me too
so um and so that was very interesting that they had that
you know another thing that I was thinking about that you have been doing since you saw Ryan is that you borrowed that movie from Roman and Sophie
I love that movie
what was your favorite part
all of it
this is one of the times you want to say all of it
that was a good movie
can I come see that
let me see that tv
this is funny it's got all kinds of stuff in here
here Momma Momma
well Momma Momma can we go to Mcdonalds today

okay oh so sorry they're out of chicken nuggets today
what are you gonna get instead
okay so you do need lots_of french fries so we'll just get those
oh oh look here's your little toy
here they got it it's the snake one from Harry Potter
the snake from Harry Potter
yeah that's a scary snake from Harry Potter
I know
what happens with that snake
yeah a sword goes into him like this yep
that's right
cause what was the snake what was the snake gonna do to Harry Potter
yeah pretty much so I guess it was okay what happened to the snake
ah let's check
uh yeah there's two boys exactly the same
what would we call them
twins
this one's name is let's see what would their names be
maybe Joe and Shmoe
what're their names
Stinky and Poo that's not names for kids
oh my she did not name her little boys Stinky and Poo I'm sorry
I think she named them Tom and Jerry
Tom and Jerry maybe
how'd you get your shirt all dirty today
what is it on there
and also I recognized those are not your sweat pants
you got wet outside at the end of the day
did you have an accident in them
oh okay
alright
okay and I'll be him
and who should Ryan be
does Ryan get to be who should Ryan be
should he get to be Big Bird
hey alright I like Big Bird
what're we gonna do
oh no
bite hands
wow Ernie must be hungry
Ernie do not eat my hands
here is some chicken for you here is some chicken eat the chicken
no no no do not eat his
oh no Matty
that is not nice words
are you hungry
I did bring you something to eat
okay well you gotta guess what I bought you
what chicken nuggets
oh no those would get cold in my bag
not french fries either those would also get cold
let's see here let's check alright ready
alright we gotta be careful that we don't get anybody's stuff dirty though alright
you can sit and eat that and we can keep talking okay
where do you wanna sit
you just want to sit in this chair
do you want me to
oh no no
we can talk
we can talk and eat this
tell Doctor Weist what you got
what is that
no no remember Doctor Weist will listen to your tape later
so he'll be curious as to what I brought you for a snack
what is it
your mommy brought you a Reese's yup
now do you know how to open that yourself
sometimes you want to bite it but you can't
can you open it that way
okay I'll try
I was just trying to think about that movie Charlotte's Web
because let's see there was a what kind of animals were in there
I think there was like a pig maybe
and what else
Wilbur
oh yeah
who else was in there
what other animals
here I'm gonna put Ernie over here just so he doesn't end up getting stuff on him okay
do you wanna make sure you hold it so
I don't know if they give those names
I don't know
they should though right
what could be a what else is in it besides ducks
I know you really like the ducks
can you use the paper to put it on here cause otherwise you're gonna end up with chocolate all over your hands
remember how you used to do that
okay
um now there's also like a really important other person in the movie not really a person
who lives in a web
yeah
well what happens with Charlotte at the end
oh well what happens with Charlotte in the middle
what does she make
what does she have
a web and what else does she have that's inside her web
remember
a word that's true she puts a word in there she puts the word humble in there right to refer to Wilbur
that's right she puts a word in there
the other thing I was thinking though was remember she has a little egg sack
doesn't she have like a thousand babies or something
wow I remember that
that is a lot of spiders
more than nineteen yes
more than seven a thousand
it would take a long time
yes
mhm
lots and lots_of spiders
it would be a lot I couldn't it would be like filling up this whole space if all the spiders were born like this whole square would be full of spiders
that's a lot of spiders
where do they go in the movie because I don't think Ryan's seen it for a long time
where do they go in the movie
where the rat eats everything
where are they
oh so there was a rat in there in the movie too
Templeton
and so he ate a lot of food
what happened to him
did he really
I bet he had a bellyache
I think so yup
and then you told me about what's your favorite song from that movie
you were singing that this morning
I'll give you a hint
what is that
that's right chin up chin up
you were singing that this morning
how does it go
I forget that song
chin up chin up and then I forget
I don't remember either
why does she sing that
Wilbur
how does it help Wilbur
remember how was he feeling since he had just come to that barnyard
yeah
he did not know anybody and he missed Fern
so he was lonely and she says chin up chin up
we've been watching that one
we borrowed it from whom
yes Ryan doesn't know we went to Roman and Sophie's house for breakfast
oh what'd you have
the same thing as the adults
well I'll have you guess
was it french toast
was it pancakes
what was it
okay
pancakes
no we didn't have pancakes
waffles
oh yummy
waffles
I got an idea what we can do
okay
how about when you get your hands washed we can pretend that we are playing Little Foot okay and that this can be the great valley okay and that we we can take the dinosaur's like over there and that we gotta get to the great valley
but now who what dinosaur should we be
okay cause we got
okay
okay I like Little Foot
okay so now you said this guy's what now
what is this guy
a duck bill
so he has to be who
Ducky okay so I'll be Ducky
and then do we have one that could be Sara
okay
I forget what Sara looks like
a Ceratops
okay
and now who is this one
ooh let's move them away okay
right we'll have them chase us okay
and let's see what about this guy
okay
now as soon as you get your hands washed we can play them okay
so you're gonna be Little Foot and I'll be Petre then
and then we'll see who your mommy wants to be
and then
Spike okay
yeah look at those little spikes
so if you could be one dinosaur what one would you be
Longneck
yeah long_necks are the kind of I think they're kind of nice
yeah
oh that sounds like a great idea
oh well I think I'd like to be Petre if I could be
is that okay
or do you have a different idea
okay I think maybe I could be Petre cause I do like him
who are you gonna be
oh and who's Ryan gonna be
oh Ducky
that's kind of like Ducky
okay now how what does he say
me Petre
what what should we do
is this when we're just first going to the great valley
okay so what'd we do
oh no
oh my gosh we better run
I'm afraid of the meat eaters
do you want these guy
here
so I get to be the meat eater then
just for a little while
okay
now what's my job do I gotta chase you
oh I don't know if we really have room for a chase game in here
we probably have_to kind of stay in one spot
let's say that maybe that you guys were sleeping and then the meat eater sneaked up on them
okay and then they gotta see they're being sneaky cause they're going for his xxx
how did you know I was coming
good thing
so we're hiding over here
I'll be the meat eater if you want me
oh yeah you can be the meat eater sure
oh he snuck up
there's the meat eater right there
he's gonna eat Little Foot watch out
you better run
what if he said what if he was very polite and he said excuse me I'm so hungry I'm a meat eater do you mind if I nibble on your foot
since nobody's using him I can nibble on him
okay
is he alive or dead
okay well thanks
I guess I'll just eat him instead
thank you for showing me but now I want to eat something that's alive
oh okay
what's his name does he have a name
I'm not you want me to eat Spike
you're gonna sacrifice one of your friends
you're like oh eat Spike instead
he is pretty he's pretty big right so I could probably eat a bunch out of him
oh my gosh
Spike Spike defended himself didn't he
now the meat eater's gone
hey Big Bird can I eat you
so then they're going to the great valley what else did they run into on the way to the valley
the same meat eater
okay I'm back
now which one do I get to eat
oh well I don't like eating dead things
I think I'm gonna eat you
oh I'm so hungry
well fine goodbye goodbye
I'm getting away from that meat eater
he's gonna be tricky
look he's gonna hide behind let's say that this was that you guys were coming behind and you did not know that he was there waiting
so like maybe this would be like big rocks right and you did not see him
he's gonna hide
okay then you guys are walking by
watch what happens
was that sneaky
what happens really in the Land Before Time I
who gets eaten
who gets eaten in the Land Before Time number one
does anybody get eaten
she does not get eaten
she might get eaten that's true
you know I hadn't thought about that but
that's right he jumps on her and then bites off part of her back so he basically ate a piece of her right
you're right about that
but Little Foot never gets eaten does he
no
we don't have another Long Neck to be his mommy
can this be
okay so how should we set it up
how does it go
oh Little Foot he hurt my back
he took a bite out of me
do you remember the way to the Great Valley
what
he does
is that what he says
remember what he says
he says I don't have_to remember mom cause you'll be with me
and she says Little Foot I can't
and then she says something about go past the mountains that burn
what are the mountains that burn
volcanos
goodbye Little Foot have a good journey
it could be you could paint on that side or put paper up on the other side
that's kind of cool isn't it
do you have_to go to the bathroom
we're almost done
I think we're done
you know
I wonder if Ryan knows what we did last night where we went at your school
where did we go
you were close you were gonna say a pet show but it wasn't a pet show it was a
yeah what was it
you forget
oh maybe we'll play with this first
you want to play with this first and then we'll talk about it later
okay
are you gonna buy that
oh I'm buying this
um sure I'd love another Harry Potter cause then they can play together right
thank you
alright I'm set two Harry Potter guys
would I like that also
um what is it
it's a little swing little guy
well let's see here
oh cool
oh oh can't I just steal it
how come
why can't I steal
it's for the law okay
let's see that's how it works okay
do you need some money for that cash register
okay
I think I can get some money
we might have some
alright honey thank you
now how much do I owe you anyway
one buck okay
I'll use this as pretend money
I think I found some
Ryan's looking for some real money
is it real real real money
what could we do if we had a bunch of money
what could we go buy at the store
cool
I have_to choose another thing in order to get some of those
okay I'd like to buy this lady please
cool
alright now so now how much do I owe you
maybe I should have the money so that I can pay you
you know how when you go to the store you gotta pay somebody
okay so let's say that I said okay I would like that how much do I owe you
ten
alright there you go
do I get any money back
you need to look for the color
oh okay
so I get one of those back
thank you
one buck thank you okay
so look at all these cool things I have
you wanna play that
what is that
a pinball set huh
yeah
I'm not sure how this works
let's figure this out
I just opened this today
oh you did
it's a new thing
what do you think you're supposed to do with these Matty
hit them down okay
hey remember we saw this on tv
remember what do you got_to try to do
hit them all down
do you remember what they call it if you get them all down
a turkey if you get three in a row that's right
we watched that on tv on bowling
oh my gosh did you get them all down
oh_my_goodness
get them
they're like sticking in there huh
here now try
there you go
alright
wow that one's a pretty tricky one to get down
oh no get them
there you go
whoa whoa
let me fix your pants
they were running away from you huh
you're pants look so funny looking
okay here we go
oh there you got them
there you go
good job
let's set them up again
do you wanna
do you want to set them up again Boo
no
okay
okay
oh my gosh the poor guys
everybody looks like he's getting hit
do you remember where this guys from
what movie he's from
the Lion King yep
Raffiki remember he's the one that says to him go back go back to the group right
remember that
and Simba goes back and then what happens
he becomes
the king that's right
I've been trying to think of what we've been doing since we've seen Ryan
well we've been watching a movie
remember we rented that movie and you watched it like five times
Charlotte's Web
Charlotte's Web
I like that movie
what's your favorite part
all of them me too
yeah we watched Charlotte's Web that's actually you might have not have seen that one Ryan that's the second one
is it
okay maybe I haven't seen it
that's when Charlotte already died
but what's in the movie who's in the movie instead of Charlotte
her kids
but that one keeps falling down
what is Charlotte who is she
okay
yep
what does she tell Wilbur in the first movie
remember she sings a song
she says chin up chin up
oh my gosh does she say hit yourself on the head
no
chin up that's right
gosh I am trying to think of what we've been doing well last night at the school there was an art show
you know Ryan's probably never been to the art show what do they have at the art show
and what have you made that's up on the walls
so you made a sculpture huh
how did you make it
with paper it's a paper sculpture
it's hiding huh
wow
oh you got a lot down that time
alright
wow
alright and how about the last one
alright
you're pretty good at this game
you know there's another thing that we should tell Ryan that he might like to visit
remember at the Science Museum what do they have at that Science Museum right now
they do
now they're very interesting dinosaurs because they are not alive
really
tell him what are the dinosaurs like
really
do they move
oh_my_goodness
do they make noises
what kind of noises do they make
like meow and stuff like that
well they're not alive so how do they run
how do they move if they're not really alive
do you remember what makes them move
electricity yes
so I'll tell him about one of them one of them has I'll tell him about the scariest one and you tell him about a different one okay
one of them has
oh you wanna tell him about one first
and what are the raptors doing
oh no
that's the scariest one I was thinking of
and there's one where their heads are almost gonna crash
and then what's another one that they have
do you remember any other ones there Boo
yeah that one was very interesting
are they big
are they big the dinosaurs
not that big
wasn't there another one that was not that big um well there's a baby there's a baby Longneck that's kind of small
well there was some baby duckbills
do I remember the one that's next to the Tyrannosaurus_Rex
uh no
I forget
was he the one that looked kind of like a Ankylosaurus
yes I remember that
so we went to the dinosaur how many times have you been to the dinosaurs museum now
wow
what else do they have at the museum
do they have a lot of stuff
can I give you a little hint
it has something there here I'll give you a hint and then you can tell Ryan
okay let's say I wrapped you up in this but it was white clothes
what did they have at the museum
mummy
well that's pretty neat
how do you feel about the mummies
you like them
you know I remember one time when you dressed up as a mummy
do you remember that
what did you use
I think so
oh yeah do we need to cut it
let me see if I can get it
oh it's not quit open yet
I don't know if I have any scissors in here either
let me try to break it real quick
what are those that you want to play with
blockies yeah
I'm trying to remember what else we've been doing
Daddy's been sick right so Daddy hasn't been doing much lately
oh I know one time something we did that Ryan did not know about
do you remember the time that we went hiking and there was all the snow and what did you do in the snow
remember when you walked along the whole ledge and we had to make our own path by the trees
that was very cool
oh should we do this
should we see if we can open it
cool thank you
so where did all this snow go anyways that we had
I know
do you like the snow
you do
actually you don't
I kind of thought you didn't so that's why I was surprised when you said you did like it
I mean it's pretty right
is that what you like about it
but it's kind of cold
what do we have at our house now since it's become more warm outside that are growing
oh what color are they
pink
it's supposed to be a girl
I'm not actually sure if it is
I don't know is she in it
it just shows one person
I think this is just the one
oh right here it shows two girls I see
I think um they just got the wrong one cause I don't see any other one do you
I guess we can use her
is this a girl or a boy
oh so we don't have a girl at all do we
what should we do with these blocks
is this can I wear this as a hat
oh_my_goodness
that fits over your head pretty well
when would this be good to have over your head do you think
when would you want to protect your face
soccer that's a good idea
will that protect your face
yeah
for baseball
your voice sounds different when you're inside there doesn't it
it sounds like you are very far away
it's cold out
oh it's cold in there
it's cold in there
come out come out
oh it's cold on your hands
pinball
do you wanna set this up again
okay let's put these away then so that we are not making a big mess okay
let's put them back
how about um you know Ryan's probably been wondering what happened to your eye
yeah I noticed that
what happened
oh
a stick bumped it yeah
this is enough in there
oh I see so that's why you thought there was a girl and a boy cause at school you have the girl and the boy
see I just think this is a smaller set
at school you probably have more blocks overalright
yeah so there's more blocks and then there's two people
so how did a stick hit your eye
were you playing outside or
oh okay
do we still have sticks at our house inside our house now
oh now you can sit
