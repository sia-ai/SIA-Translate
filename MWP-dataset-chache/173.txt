once upon a time there was a little kitty and the kitty belonged to a little girl

okay
the little girls was called Jacyntha
okay
so what do you want to call the cat
kitty
or Olivia

we'll call her
kitty
ah you goose
anyway your kitty was very little
okay
Chooklee was a really little kitty
and Jacyntha used to bring her for a walk in a stroller
Olivia
may maybe Olivia's further on in the story
and anyway one day when Jacyntha was in the park and she was picking flowers Chooklee
is that what he's called
okay
hopped right out_of the stroller and ran away and hid
she hid behind a tree
and Jacyntha was very upset wasn't she
right
okay
okay
we'll call the kitty Olivia then
okay
and she went up
and she asked a policeman what she should do cause she really didn't know what to do
Chooklee had never been lost before
so here's the policeman
here
look
does he look like a policeman
he's got a policeman's hat
and he's got a policeman's uniform hasn't he
right
that's right
and there's a little boy here on a tricycle
now
we'll see what happens
and the policeman found Chooklee
look
see him pointing at him
see him
he says
look
there he is
okay
Olivia was watching the whole thing from her trike right
right
right
so look
there's Chooklee
let's see what happens
so they went up and they tried to catch Chooklee
see
and he went up and he tiptoed up so Chooklee wouldn't notice
and he took a great big jump and tried to catch the cat
but the cat got away
see that
the cat running away
and Olivia's here
and Olivia's looking at the whole thing
that's right
so they all followed the cat huh
and here's the cat
and the cat doesn't the cat doesn't look very nice cat
really cross
isn't that right
he's frowning
how's he going like
he is
he doesn't seem to be a very nice cat Livie
he's not a very nice cat at all is he
no so they followed the cat and the cat went into this big hole
look
this big pipe
and we'll see what happened then
oh
look
they're going in the pipe too
and the cat's really out the other side
see
okay
let's see what happened next
so the policeman came out the other side and there's the cat on the top
and the policeman can't see the cat
but when Jacyntha comes out she sees the cat and she says
look
there he is
he's running way up to the top
you'd better get after him fast
see him
running right up
okay
so he's up there
and the police
oh
is the policeman meant to be in water or something Liv
is that meant to be water
no
it's just the ground
anyway
oh
I see
okay
anyway Jacyntha's climbing out and she falls down right on top of the policeman
see
and the cat ran down to see
cause he didn't do anything
and they fell right into the water
look

and the cat runs right into that into that tube again
he runs all the way to where
to the other side
and who catches the cat
