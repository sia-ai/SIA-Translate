ah hi you're the one who sold me all the dinosaurs right
ah I'm having a little bit of trouble
you told me that this one this this mean one would not eat my other dinosaurs
well he is
he keeps chewing on the Brachiasaurus's neck
I'd like you to come and come back and get him please
hello hello
did he just break that
no xxx
here you go I can't keep him
I'm so sorry
oh_my_goodness he wants to stay
ah but I don't want him to eat meat he's supposed to be a plant eater I thought
oh okay he drove away okay okay
I think that we'll be fine now
I think we'll have a good coexistence now
okay
did you put him in time+out
he says he's not gonna eat my dinosaurs anymore
do you have something I could use to tie up his mouth
hm
how about this
can I use this
you're right
hm alright I think I just have_to
hm we can check
she might have string huh
this is kind of a string
oh great we'll use that
do you know what that's from Matty
yeah that's to help Harry Potter fly
okay I wanted to tell you I have a little bit of a problem
okay I'm going to be going on a trip soon
I was wondering if you could come and babysit for the dinosaurs
what
no no no my I'm going to my mom's house and she is very afraid of dinosaurs
so I don't really think I can bring them with
can't you just take them back
Harry Potter
um I don't xxx if I saw see it
I don't see the guy here
yeah I don't know honey
why don't you just wear it as a necklace
what a beautiful necklace see
can Spiderman go flying on it
it must be lost
what do you wanna have Matty something to what
each of those things you mean
do they open up
you almost got it
do you want help
yeah oh she got it great
so we can that be to tie up my that that um meateaters mouth or are you gonna do something else with it now
remember you said I could bring it with to help my tie up my dinosaurs
oh you are talking about bringing my dinosaurs with me on the trip
no I can't
leave him in the car what happens when people walk by
they'll be very scared
yes my grandma
other people just neighbors people going to the grocery store and stuff they would be screaming
hm
can we tie him up in the web
here lets tie his mouth up in the web
it would be like help help I can't move my mouth
oh good idea
um hm
is that working pretty good
you could just put it in his mouth oh good
there's one problem he can still bite
you tried to fill up his mouth huh
with spider webs
actually it's beautiful
but no now he's safe he won't be able to bother the Brachiasaurus anymore good idea
so are you still gonna watch him while I'm on my trip
no
hey I talked to you about going bowling remember
remember last night I went bowling and I was thinking that you might wanna go bowling too
it is only on Sundays for kids
oh
you wanna try it with big people's what
to go bowling yeah because that's the thing on Sunday afternoons they have little pins
or I think the pins are the same size but they have lighter balls because balls can be very heavy to throw bowling balls
it's going to be fun though isn't it
you gotta see if you can get a strike and knock all of them down right
those are gonna be really loud
how about if we do it right at the end because you know how those are super loud
yeah
so at school today I was wondering how's Dawson been doing
oh no
a yellow stick you heard about Dawson before right
yeah
what did he do to get a yellow stick
oh_my_goodness did anyone else get one
who Dawson
oh
but it was just to late huh
he didn't have a chance to get the other one out
so he speckled it huh
yeah
I didn't notice did you get a sticker from naptime today
how come
how come
were you talking to what's her name again
did anybody else get stickers
oh no maybe tomorrow
oh_my_goodness
am I understanding this right you got a yellow stick today for a little while
huh why did you get a yellow stick today
you were just kneeling
oh okay is this what happened
for naptime like the rest of the day was fine and then at naptime you got a yellow stick and then it went okay and she took the yellow stick out
hm very interesting
well we're gonna have_to try to think about how to makes sure it goes better
do you know I was very surprised
I did not know that you got a yellow stick today
not bed early because you got the yellow stick taken out yeah
but if you had had the yellow stick still
bed early
what time is you have_to go to bed if it's early
maybe like six
there's more what
right because you usually go to bed at eight so seven o'clock you miss all that entirely right if you went to bed at six
well it looks like we don't have_to go to bed early though so that's good news
because you've got some stuff to do tonight right
like
yeah eat what else
oh the poor dinosaur
well I thought you might wanna play with your top tonight
alright
we've been also writing thank you letters right
what um hm
I see
you know actually I've never tried this can I see
okay we will do it together
pull it out super fast
okay am I good to go
then I grab this and pull it out as fast as I can
okay
oh sorry
I didn't mean to
I never did it before
have you ever seen one of these like this
I haven't
oh they seem very interesting
okay is this fast
is that right
not completely fast enough okay
oh zoom okay
okay you gonna put it back in again
okay I'll try again
hm okay okay
where does it get stuck in
okay can I try
is that right
or did I put it in upside down
oh
okay let's see if we find paper
and crayons
oh I see some crayons xxx to be crayons right here
hum
here are some glitter crayons
ooh xxx
some yellow paper xxx but somebody already drew on these
huh that's a pretty good one
there's a oh there's actually quite a bit of paper left
yeah
there you go do you want markers too
okay
here's your normal regular
which ones do you like better Matty
do you think you like the glitter ones better
yeah
okay
oh so she's going to be very curious as to what you are gonna be making
what are you planning on here
you know how to make him
wow that's a great idea since you've been talking about him at school
what do you know about Abraham Lincloln
we talked about him a little bit yesterday what did he do that was important that he said about the people that were slaves
no more slave states that's right he said no more slave states that's right
yeah what did he think about the people that were a different color
he thought what
should we treat them differently should we make them sit in the back of the bus or make them be slaves what did he think
uh hum everybody should be considered equal right
uh hum
we haven't really talked about this too much are there any other presidents you talked about at school
who else
did you talk about George Washington
yeah do you remember anything about him
no I don't really know too much except he was the first president
yeah that's pretty cool
so we've been doing lots_of stuff since we saw her because one of the things that's been very exciting was is a couple a days ago there was Valentine's Day
yeah
so what did you do for you school for Valentine's Day
you brought valentines
for
uh hum
now did you just bring them to the kids you are really are good friends with or what
that's nice
yeah
and so how did you how do we know who's valentine's is who what did you have_to do
uh hum write the names on every valentine yep
that was pretty cool
and then what did you end up getting from your classroom on Valentine's Day
uh hum is that it just the paper valentines anything else
yeah
some toys some pencils
some kids brought pencils some people brought candy yep
that is awesome
you drew the hair mostly yep yep I see the hair on him
uh hum you can see it it's light but you can definitely see it
what do you think would that be a good idea
yeah maybe then we can see it a little better
is
you're gonna try that one try that pink
well we did something that was super fun on Sunday Saturday night do you remember what did we go see as a whole family where did we go
well we drove there I'll give you a little hint there were some fireworks
so what did we see there besides fireworks
the ice castles
okay so what's an ice castle anyway
and then what else was right by there besides an ice castle what else was kind of near there surrounding the ice castle
some what
you're trying to remember the word right
they were ice sculptures
yeah we saw lots_of ice sculptures
some of them were broken though by the time we went that was disappointing
and what were some of the other kids doing that evening
that we thought it was kind of too cold maybe to do or too icy what were some of the kids doing there
uh hum playing in the snow they had big snow hills and the kids were playing on it
so that was pretty cool
and then remember you chose something there
a light up sword
wow
that was very helpful because remember what did what did I use it for when we were walking back to the car
uh hum so we would be safe and nobody would hit us with their car yeah so that was kind of great yeah
so I held it out by the road right
uh hum
so that was helpful I'm trying to think of what else you and daddy went sledding this weekend too right that was something else that happened
he told me some funny stories about that didn't you guy's crash or something
yeah
tell her about that
wow so was that fun or were you scared
not too bad
you did get cold yeah I know
mommy hasn't really gone sledding too much recently because I got wet everywhere and I got full of snow and I got cold
I don't like being cold how about you
yeah so you got_to go sledding recently and hm I'm trying to think of what else we have been up to hm well of course there was Valentine's Day
oh on Saturday or Sunday rather remember we went shopping oh my goodness we went everywhere shopping do you remember that
and what did we decide in terms of at the mall if you did a great job at the mall then what
Abraham Lincoln
okay
Abraham Lincoln
now Abraham is missing something
hm
yeah
poor Abraham needs what
you'll draw it okay
you've forgotten though sometimes I dunno why because you've got two yourself right
yeah
so uh we went shopping yep and he was allowed to get ah what did you chose for your snack
are those his knees
oh his pockets to keep stuff in his pockets that's a good idea
did you forget what you chose at the mall
let me give you a hint you go like this
what could that be
ice cream mm
yeah an ice cream cone
because he did do a good job it's hard at the mall because we really literally went to like three malls we did a lot of shopping we didn't go inside of all of them
but remember right before we went to the first mall you were not feeling well remember what you said to me
no I do you said I'm gonna
you said I'm gonna throw up
you didn't though but you thought you were gonna in the car so we stopped right away and we had lunch because you weren't feeling very well in the car
you told me actually something that happened one day when I was at work because daddy has been off work all week so you stayed home with daddy on Monday and then there was something that happened in terms of your not feeling well do you remember that
no okay well I heard a story about how you threw up everywhere
everywhere well not everywhere but a lot of places right
um hm
we actually had couple of other interesting days because I had to go to Seattle right
so who took care of you when I went to Seattle
um hm and who else
didn't somebody have_to didn't have_to go to somebody's house and stuff
you need a tissue I know
I have one
oh you do that's great
hey Boo
what are these
how many fingers does he have
oh man he got three more
he's been kind of sick
blow go ahead and blow
wow lots
I know yuck ick you've got another one
she's a very helpful person go ahead
yeah I don't know how you got sick
but there was one night remember a couple a nights ago you woke up and said mommy mommy and what did you want to do in the middle of the night
did you want to stay in your own bed
how come
well you said in case you threw up right
you wanted us to see that you were sick
did you throw up in mommy and daddy's bed
that's what he said he didn't want to get his own bed messy right Boo
just not in mine in mommy and daddy's bed
there's been actually I had something that I wondered if Helga would know much about and that is we've been watching this movie a lot
right and then we actually checked it for a week out but then daddy forgot to return it well I kind of forgot too but I thought daddy was gonna do it and anyway so what happened we got it
it was overdue yeah so we got it for another week but you watched that pretty much almost every day but do you know what the name of it is
Jumanji
have you ever seen that movie
uh hum
oh that's a great movie
that's such a funny show oh that's an awesome sun that makes it for a very sunny day
so what's your favorite part of Jumanji
oops
oops the crayons are falling out
so what's your favorite part of Jumanji Boo
but he really didn't die right
she couldn't have died so what happened to her
she played dead
I am trying to think of what my favorite part is hm I dunno
I kind of like the end when everything gets sucked back up into the game that part's cool
I can't remember what anything looked like
you don't need it
you were telling the people at your school about your favorite animal that was in that movie
you remember
well so which is your favorite animal
you liked the elephants
it smooshes it which isn't really what would happen what would really happen
well think about it
for
yeah but instead he just gets kind of stuck in his car
it's a very pretty ball isn't it I like it
so what would you like to do Boo you made an awesome picture of Abraham Lincoln
what do you want to do next do you want to play with this little house thing
do you want more paper
okay
George Bush
oh okay you can draw that now sure
he has short hair
kind of brown I think I think just brown hair right
um hum
maybe kind of brown or maybe gray
sure you draw the head and I'll do the hair sure
hope you like green does he have a green head maybe
pink on pink
hum here we go here is his head and then he's got some brown
I'll put the brown here on
how's this color of brown is this one fine
I think it is maroon that's pretty xxx
how about this here's a brown
are you alright
that's probably pretty much it good
oh_my_goodness that's a funny part
do you remember why mommy and daddy don't really like the president
oh what did he decide that we should do or that we should have that mommy and daddy don't think we should have
yes that's right
why did he think so
um
good question
well I think he thought that there were some bad people in this country and so he thought that he should have a war with them but the bad people probably weren't gonna hurt us and they probably won't
you know xxx except you know what the people in this other country that's called Iraq they were hurting they own people so that's not very good and he was going to try and save people there
do you think that sounds good that he was going to try to save people from a mean guy
but now we're still stuck in the war so that's too bad because we were xxx
so we should draw him what kind of a face should we make him
scared
he might be scared because he might not be the president anymore we're gonna get a new one maybe maybe he's scared
you think he is happy
because he's president now
that's a very big smile
happy guy huh
now he lives in Washington D C remember when you went to visit there
that was a good trip
remember we saw uh
I know I didn't go to Washington D C but I did go to the other place
New York City
remember what did we all see together in New York City that was super super super cool
do you remember
there was a lady
she stands like this with a book and her torch
she's very tall
what
the Statue of xxx
the Statue of Liberty yeah we went and saw that
that was cool you liked the Statue of Liberty a lot
your dad yep it's true like a little key chain thing right
uh hum what would you say is your favorite place we ever visited
I'll tell you the names ready Sears Towers Statue of Liberty or um the Washington the big thing with Lincoln in Washington D C
which do you think is the coolest of those
um hm
you don't need a ball okay
so what do you think which one's the coolest
okay Sears Tower or Statue of Liberty or the Lincoln Memorial
Sears Tower's your favorite
how come
is it taller than Statue of Liberty
yeah
Sears Tower Sears Tower is the tallest building in the
world that's right Sears Tower is tall
but Statue of Liberty is kind of cool too because when you go to the Statue of Liberty how do you get there
that's kind of fun
when we went from Connecticut to New York
we took a very a really big ferry we were on the boat for about an hour and half that was quite an adventure
you definitely made him a plaid shirt I think it looks great yep awesome job
are you going to put his arms on
yeah yep that's him
let's put his name on the top too okay xxx
no or or should I write the names or are you gonna write the names
I'll tell you the letters

alright alright so George is the first name
George Washington I mean no no George W Bush or President Bush is what people usually just
great he's a happy guy huh
I like both your pictures
is it a sunny day for George Bush or no
because you know Lincoln got a sun a sun there how about George Bush
oh you were thinking about the sun huh
so what do you think about being a president of the whole country and being in charge of the whole country what do you do you want to do that maybe when you get older
how come
you think it would be a lot of work
what do you think you maybe want to do
not sure you used to sometimes say you wanted to be an astronaut
that would be cool huh
um sometimes you used to say you wanted to be a doctor or a veterinarian
uh hum you could take care of our own pets exactly good idea
they might have_to stay overnight if they are very sick yes
that would be good
how about do you wanna be a police man
yeah you think that would be cool

so what else have we actually been doing we actually been having an exciting weekend because Saturday remember it was Erica's party and then Sunday Erica and Jimmy came over and then Roman came over Friday night and it was just a wild day so all these days
do you remember do you want to talk about Roman sleeping over
oh
so where did you sleep
you did but you're not a guest
you love that bed though how come you love that bed so much
really how come you think you like it
oh it has butterflies and moons on it okay
then where did Roman sleep
and Roman kind of wanted to sleep in the guest bed he says I'm the guest
and then we tried to convince him he really wasn't a guest we said he was just a friend but he thought he was really the guest so he should have slept in that other bed right
and then something kind of happened when it was time to leave that was kind of sad do you remember something that he borrowed
what's the story about that
she did
oh to borrow it
yeah I just kind of Roman asked for it when Matty wasn't home because he was at the dentist so I said he could take it and borrow it right
when's he gonna bring it back
yeah probably Saturday Thursday at gymnastics you'll get it back right
but that was hard for you wasn't it you really wanted your Jumangi tape but I thought he really liked it a lot so
you actually have the movie don't you oh not yet
you don't have the movie yet
what's happening with that movie
he got it off his computer so when's it gonna come I wonder maybe today it might even be there when we get home
Jumangi
well we ordered it and it's supposed to come in the mail so it will come in the mail
yeah
moving on to the next thing
watch out for the cord good idea
so we've been playing this kind of fun game at home that's called the magic dice game
so you're gonna want him on your team
and I gotta be on my own team
when's the idea in terms of playing next what would you like to do with that
oh so the next time after that then you and I get to be together
well when are we going to play are we going to play next week or
here I don't want this to be kind of scraping because it's loud so
today we are playing this game today
oh before daddy has to do to church
yeah
oh this is an interesting thing that she probably does not know about
oh Matty please do not burp into the tape
what would you say if you burped
do we gonna have any more burps
I see maybe we should put it away
alright no more burps next time you burp then we'll put it away okay
I was gonna say that Helga doesn't know the story about when you went to church and you got
tell her about that
you got what
the blessings
the blessings
what are those called that they put on your forehead
oh ashes
oh I don't want you to choke on that
so yeah they were ashes and they put them on his head and then they said a blessing and then why do they even put ashes on your head what is it remind us of
um
you've got some on your nose I know
wait a minute now think a second what why do we what do we even have this for what's this mean
yes that's right so that's to remind us of that right yeah
yeah
hey Matty I love you too
so you did something kinda funny after remember daddy went to go see a movie on Sunday and he was at what Jenny and Erica came over and daddy was kind of sad about the movie and then what did you do
oh remember what I mentioned
oh we'll put it away till we get home we don't want burps on the whole tape
okay so what was it that you did that was super funny with your bed
with all his animals he almost covered us up entirely
wow you have a lot of animals
he really does actually he has a big big bunny that's just like almost as big as him right
which is your favorite animal would you say
that is your favorite one now
how about what else do you like
you gonna tell doctor Weist what you're doing right now or do you think he would not want you to do it
yeah he might think that is funny
well you've got your tummy right there
I see it I was actually thinking that I could see that he had cheese sandwich
oh_my_goodness
I can't
well you just had it today for lunch
where is the cheese sandwich
yeah it's probably got all broken up into tiny tiny pieces by now
a long time ago at lunchtime right
yeah
you know I don't think doctor Weist knows about the math class you're in what would you say about the math class what do you do guys do
oh_my_goodness really
that's what you do you and Brian and Brianna and Zoe and whoever else is there
well wasn't there another little group with two girls in your class

is it hold on it looks very is it sparkly
I wish you could see the picture he made today of the pizza parlor it was very cool
oh yeah
oh yeah it was what what was it about what was in the pizza parlor picture
and some fans and wheels
and you know do you make the pizza's are they cooked inside the parlor
no
you have_to do what
I see you can just drives around and sells the pizza but you have_to cook it at your house
it's a really interesting picture
so tell me about this picture you're making
you wanna sit here want me to move
okay
what are these things
uh hum
and these are more logs right
does he get to go inside the picture the president guy
yes
hum
white
I think I'll go and sit in my own chair because I am falling off this one
what's this part
oh so he can look outside of his house
uh hm
that's a good idea
yeah I think that's the color you've been using yeah
you're gonna use yellow for the guy
I think when we saw you last it was right after Presidents' day wasn't it
um hm
and he had made remember Matty pictures of president Bush and president Lincoln or something
Washington maybe it was George Washington you made
that was what
you made the one that thought wars were good you mean Bush our president now that was the one that thought wars were good
I thought you were talking about Lincoln
yeah and Lincoln he tried to he wasn't that excited about wars but there was a war when he was the president but he was the one remember Lincoln who said no slave states
no slave territories
right
so this is gonna be a great picture
you know after we go home today after we gotta go find daddy and we gotta go vote for trying to get a new president
you think that's a good idea where we can get a new one
yeah
you're not old enough to vote but you can come with us
you have_to be eighteen
how old are you
yeah not quite yet
so what do you think if I gonna say should I vote for John Kerry or John Edwards
you think I should vote for John Edwards
how come
does it sound like a better name
John Edwards
okay he's a younger man he's actually not that much older than me and daddy really
oh there's the guy there's Lincoln in there in his house cool
oh what's this part of it
oh
um hm you've got the color that's usually there
so alright so Edwards okay
so hopefully when we get a new president then there won't be a war anymore hopefully we'll see
that's the nose
now when we go home you wanted to see if your gummie thing is done right
yeah
how do you even make those gummy things anyway
you just stick red stuff in there and they become red
what becomes red
and then what do you with it how does it become different shapes
um hm
the little plate thing and it come out into different shapes
but what happens if they don't come out if they are just stuck in the container
oh so if it is not done today we'll just wait until tomorrow
okay that sounds not too bad
little they're little gummy things so I see so you chose the color to make it red
I see that was the only thing left
so what if there was a dinosaur that came to Abraham Lincoln's house
then why'd you xxx a dinosaur there
sure
he would probably what
devoid them
so you made this his house when he was the president so what if the dinosaurs come you'd say do you think he would avoid them or do you think he would destroy them
avoid them right
now what would the president say you are not welcome here go back to your planet
did the dinosaurs get in I thought is the president oh_my_goodness what is the dinosaur doing
it ate the whole log cabin house
Abraham Lincoln
wow what kind of a face would he have now that his whole house got eaten
do you know how to even draw a sad face
wow oops I think we'll have_to put them back in after you're done drawing okay
that's a nose right
well let's see I think a happy face goes like this right so a sad face just faces the other way
that's a sad face you start at the bottom like a rainbow you know kind of like drawing a rainbow
uh that's a good sad face
ah I'm so sad a dinosaur ate my house
what's that part
oh you are just putting your name in it
m a t t
and then we got some legs
and a big foot
anything else he's missing
what
yeah I think arms
okay
okay for Abraham Lincoln should I put his name on the top
should I put Abraham Lincoln say
ate house
well that's the other side would be the ate house
ate house we would actually say eaten house
yeah eaten house
eaten
we would say we have eaten the house
oh really
what if it was made out of candy
what if it was made out of candy then we would eat it
Abraham Lincoln's eaten house okay
hum what did you draw it
like all on your own mouth I see sad
are you feeling so sad
infinity
you wish you could have infinity what
infinity pieces of candy
what would happen if you had that much candy do you think
yeah you would get a stomach ache
xxx make you eat and the dinosaur xxx
so I have a funny idea
we're almost done but I was thinking about we've been reading a lot of those Jenny B Jones books you know how you are going to have your party like that
do you wanna tell doctor Weist the story quick about Jenny B Jones when she has the slumber party
no
what's the other one we read recently
Big Fat Mouse
I don't really remember what happens in that one
oh yeah yeah yeah that's when she wants to do to certain for for career day she wants to be a certain thing
yeah do you remember that
yeah
I don't want you to fall
we're gonna go away for a while and that will be fun
a trip
yeah where're we going tomorrow Boo
ah
going to the store
no
going further
what're we going to do you might not remember the town what're we going to do at the place we're going to
see dinosaurs at the dinosaur museum
yes and what's the other thing that is going to happen
wow at the hotel swimming pool
so were you just going to say something like go swimming with the dinosaurs
okay
do you know how to swim
no
how do you usually do it when you're in the pool with daddy
do you put something on your hands
no
daddy just carries you right
yeah Matty's not afraid of the water though right
no
and then sometimes do you ride on daddy's back when he's swimming
yeah that's cool
now I love the water right isn't that true I always go swimming with you two right
hm
that is not true
what'd I usually do
stay in the room right or maybe if there is a hot tub I go in the hot tub right
I like the hot tub
yep we're gonna go away tomorrow and then we're gonna stay over night and then we're gonna come back Saturday we are not gonna be gone very long
we're going to Pittsburgh
oh
that's the plan
so what were we thinking about tonight
what were we just talking about in the bathroom
I'll tell her because you're not sure
we were planning to go
the movie night well she doesn't know what a movie night is what happens at a movie night
touch your nose with your tongue
I can't do that
I can't either
whoa we just realized something weird Boo
do it again
I did not know I could not do that
neither can I
oh_my_goodness
so what happens during a movie night
do we just turn the tv on and whatever movie comes on we watch it
okay so what happens at the movie night
where do we get the movies
we can get one from the video store or sometimes we can check one out from the library right
so that's a possibility too
so so why don't you tell her about that very cool thing about being on the computer today at your school
two times you got_to play on the computer okay so what was the cool thing that happened with the picture hand
didn't you say something about a plane
whoa oops
alright I'll pick these up you tell her about the plane
this one
any color okay I'll put these up here
alright so what happened with how you had to do things with the computer and then you made a plane how did that go
but what'd you do for that
okay you played a Blues Clues game and then
you were telling me about something how something with prizes
you said something like you got all like there was like fifteen prizes and then at the end all the prizes made a puzzle and it turned into something right
um hm it turned into the plane and then what'd the plane do
around his whole room of his school
well okay it just flew around on the computer
I've been thinking about what we've been doing since we saw her
you helped your daddy do something on the weekend you did a good job do you remember what you were helping daddy do recently
well I'll give you a hint it has to do with the fact that we do not can't use the bathroom downstairs at our house anymore
so what was the part that you helped with
you took did I did not know that you helped take the toilet out
and then what else did you do
hm was there other parts with the flooring
wasn't there something you did with the floor too
took the floor out too
so you've been working on the bathroom and then on Monday was a special day because you went to somebody's house
yeah talk about what you did at Gabi's house
you played with her brother's cars
cool and what else did you do at her house
you
not for real hm just pretending the idea that you threw crayons
hm she doesn't have any food at her house right wasn't that an issue
you ate food what'd you have
crayons
you ate crayons
chocolate chocolate chip cookies that sounds pretty good
um hm
oh you know what I remember something very cool that we did since we've seen Helga last
we went to an art museum
Florida
in Florida are you sure it was in Florida
oh well tell her about what you saw at the art museum
I'm trying to remember well we saw some sculptures that were very strange remember the sculptures of people
yes they had no clothes on some of the sculptures um the people sculptures and you liked some of the pictures that were very bright right
and then when we left you got a little present do you remember what that was
hum we didn't actually finish it remember you were working on it
okay so what was it
um hm
what about the necklace would you say is interesting
there's a fish on it right so and it has all these beads we had to make it you started it but you did not finish it right maybe you want to finish it tonight and we can bring it on our trip tomorrow
yeah that would be cool
so tell me about what you're drawing so intently what is this thing here
wires
I want to get that
oh_my_goodness that is totally cool where's the wheels
oh that sounds like an awesome idea cool
we played a fun game at home last night do you remember the one where you had to do all those different things
it was a fun game
what were some of the funny things we had to do
I had to pull a pillow around yes
what did you have_to do lots_of times
xxx had to sing a song
and then another thing that we kept having to do was remember flying around
and we kept ah there was another one we kept running into too we kept having to do again and again what's the one with the animals remember naming the animals
which one
the one we both had to do huh uh I can't remember what was another one we had to do
oh yeah yeah at the end of the game what do you have_to do
but what is it what're you doing
oh
we stretch up and
touch the sky
I remember another we used to have_to do all the time too that was um go on all fours and pretend what
pretend that we were a cow yeah
it was supposed to be a game for the county fair
um hm
so we had to go around and you had to do different things
it was kind of good exercise wasn't it
hum
so I'm trying to think what else we've been doing this week
we went to the art museum that was a big deal
yes
what do you need money for
you mean when we leave
okay well we will go out that exit okay and I will let you choose a candy bar if I have money
okay we'll look in my purse
what kind of candy do you like any kind
what kind
hm he likes Reeses peanut butter stuff
see I don't because you know what did we just do before we came here
we stopped to go to the bathroom at a place but what did we get at that place for you
what you forget when you already just ate it
oh alright so that's what I am thinking about you had a cookie and then you are thinking about having candy too
what about your dinner
you still want dinner too
do you know what's in the freezer I think that you have not eaten yet
your favorite macaroni and cheese you know the spiral noodles
from ah Boston Market
you love those
I was thinking you might
so I was thinking we went to the art museum and then that same day we went to Buffalo to um go out to dinner or it was lunch remember and Matty had something that he'd never had before
remember what was in those those little won_tons those things that you had on your plate and we did not tell you until afterwards of what you ate do you remember
when they had little pieces of shrimp
what'd you think about that
I think we should order you a big thing of shrimp now because you probably really like it now
you didn't even know you ate shrimp
oh okay
what's the only kind of meat you like really
pretty much yeah
and another one you eat too
what's another thing you might eat in a sandwich
ham he'll eat ham and chicken that's pretty much it
these are all the wheels
now I have_to admit I'm a little nervous if these are all wires is it safe to touch the paper
are you sure
I dunno I got a little little shocks from touching it
you saw a movie that just had him in it recently
what was it
do you remember what it's called
Lion King one and a half
hum and he can do anything to his arms
you can twist up the waist very well let's see oh yeah he can like even dance
who's that do you know who that is supposed to be
I think it this is supposed to be um his brother George
George Weesly
yeah remember he played Quidditch too
we were just talking about Harry Potter in the bathroom how did you say it you said it perfectly how they say his name
see you do it with an accent yeah
do you know that a new Harry Potter movie's coming out this summer
yeah it's gonna be good we'll have_to go see it
