a lot of times like if we once I said to her we were gonna go to the children's museum and we drove there and it wasn't open
and I kept saying oh gosh it's closed I'm sorry I'm sorry so it in some ways she says it sometimes and I think that she just means like um
like something bad happened
like it's a shame kind of like that
oh I see
right
sometimes we say I'm sorry kind of like that's a shame right
in any sense she's kind of recognizing that she did something that she's not a hundred percent proud of
right right
I know we had to go home
remember we went to the children's museum and it was closed
that was a shame
and then we went home
you're right

Paddington's lucky day
ooh boy

okay
whoop

mm
Paddington's lucky day
you know Paddington lives in England
we went to England when we went to Ireland the airplane stopped there
one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor Gardens Missus Brown thought she would take him out shopping
we're going to Portabello Road exclaimed Judy
it's a big outdoor market quite near here
you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan
there's a lot to see
Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
suddenly they turned a corner and found himself in what seemed like a different world
a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit and vegetables people
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
sweetie pie you know what
you know the you know where your armoire is in your room
you know where we keep your books in your room
in your bedroom
exactly the thing that your diapers are in
there's a picture on there and Daddy and I bought that picture on Portabello road
before you were born
and a picture of a Mommy and her little baby girl
yeah
one store was even having its picture taken
that's a new supermarket explained Judy
there must be something special going on there
do we like the supermarket
what do you get at the supermarket
that's right
Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the xxx through the glass
perhaps I could do some shopping for you Missus Brown he said hopefully
Missus Brown hesitated
she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
but Jonathan told her not to worry
even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
what goes in must come out
we can meet him back by the check+out counter on our way back added Judy
Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door
that's the manager
what's he wearing
a suit right
and that man's wearing a coat
what's he wearing around his neck
a tie you're right
and what's that man wearing on his face
what's he wearing on his
over his eyes
is he wearing xxx
that's right he's wearing glasses
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
marmalade's like jam
do you like jam
there it is you're right
he could certainly see why it was called a super market
his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he's left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming towards him pushing a large basket on wheels
may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
you can take as much as you want now he continued
can I really exclaimed Paddington
the manager nodded
yes we like to make our customers happy
Paddington looked most impressed
in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
the more Paddington saw of the super market the more he liked it
and he was sure Missus Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
uhoh
Paddington thinks he can take them for free
the other customers looked on in amazement
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddington with interest
since he had been in the sore the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
and as Paddington reached the check out counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
Paddington had never been in a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy and he gave the man a friendly wave
achoo did someone sneeze
is your nose stuffy
do you want Mommy to clean it
your sneeze fell
oh
well done said the lady handing him a ticket
I hope you've brought a truck with you
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
over a hundred and fifty dollars worth he gasped
but I've only got a nickel
looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for the groceries
but it was too late
with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
oh no it's falling on Paddington
Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered in groceries
where's Paddington
there he is
he was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
what's that
a turkey
that's right
you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
a prize echoed the Browns
and the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
this young bear happens to be our thousandth customer today
that's a big sign
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply of groceries
xxx all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
even in super markets
Paddington sniffed the air happily
I like Portabello road he said
I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
yay
what book do you wanna read now
which book is that
Paddington at the seaside
great
he's got some floaties on
he's got some floats on his arms
today said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside
hands up all those who agree
Jonathan Judy and Missus Brown all put up their hands
and Paddington raised both his paws as well just to make sure
there's a tent at the seaside there is we're gonna get to that you're right
everyone was very excited and by the time they set out the Brown's car was so full of things there was scarcely room to move
Paddington carefully fastened his seat+belt
do you think he sits in a special car+seat like yours
yes I think so too
are we nearly there Mister Brown he asked hopefully
he's looking out the window you're right
Mister Brown removed a shovel handle from his left ear
I'm afraid not he said gloomily we've only just left Windsor gardens and it's a very long way to the sea
Mister Brown was right it was a long journey
but when they reached the seaside the sight of the land and water soon made up for it
Paddington gave an excited sniff as he climbed out of the car
even the air had a different smell
that's because it's special seaside air said Missus Brown it's very good for you
what are those
what are those
remember what type of special bird they are near the ocean
are they seagulls
yeah
you saw a sign with seagulls on Waterman street
when we were driving back
she xxx I just taught her seagulls this morning and we were driving back from my sister's um when she was at work
Lily said seagulls seagulls and there's like a
I don't know some sort of
like a dental office or something like that that's got seagulls on it
are you so smart
yeah
Paddington looked around anxiously as Mister Brown began laying out beach things
I hope the air doesn't get used up Missus Brown he said in a loud voice
and he gave a man doing deep breathing exercises a very hard stare indeed
come on Paddington called Judy let's go for a swim
it took Paddington quite a while to get ready
he wasn't the sort of bear who believed in taking chances and by the time he went into the sea he was wearing so many things he promptly sank
no wonder cried Judy you haven't even bothered to blow up your paw bands
fancy wearing a duffel coat in the water exclaimed Jonathan
I thought the water might be cold said Paddington
after his paw bands had been properly blown up Paddington went in the water again
and with some help from Jonathan and Judy he was soon swimming very well indeed
oh she's got a lollipop
Paddington had barely closed his eyes when he had heard something very strange going on behind him
first there was a loud cry
then there were the sound of people booing
they're watching Mister Briggs' Punch and Judy explained Missus Brown
Paddington jumped up
lollipop
jumped up and looked at the others as if he could hardly believe his ears
but Mister and Missus Brown seemed much too busy with the picnic things to be bothered
oh who's got the ice cream cone
where's Paddington asked Jonathan when he and Judy arrived back shortly afterwards carrying ice cream cones and an ice stick
I hope he's not long said Judy I brought him a special cone
he'll be most upset if it melts
xxx Jonathan glanced up and down the beach crikey he said look over there
the Browns gave a gasp as they turned to follow the direction of Jonathan's gaze
something very odd seemed to be going on inside the Punch and Judy tent
there was a large bulge on one side and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive
suddenly the tent began moving across the sand scattering people in all directions
it just missed a large sand castle went twice around the ice cream man and headed toward sea
quick shouted Judy let's cut it off
but it was too late
Paddington cried Judy as a familiar face swam into view
what on earth are you doing
that's the second time I've had to rescue you
Paddington stared at her in amazement
but I went to rescue you he said
seagulls
Missus Brown said you were being punched by Mister Briggs
Missus Brown
seagulls
Missus Brown looked at Paddington in astonishment
and then her face cleared
I didn't say Mister Briggs was punching Judy I said it was his Punch and Judy
it's a puppet theater said Judy
they often have them at the seaside
there's one puppet called Mister Punch and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo
a lollipop
if it took the Browns a long time to explain a Punch and Judy show to Paddington it took them even longer to explain Paddington to Mister Briggs
but when he saw the enormous crowd watching his face lit up
it was the biggest audience he'd had in a long time and decided to make the most of it by putting on another show
you can have a seat in the front row he said to Paddington
I expect bears do very good boos
one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside
but all good things come to an end and when it was time to leave he stood for a moment holding up an empty marmalade jar
I'm just collecting some sea air for the journey home he said
I think I shall sleep so well on the way back I may lose all of today's air with my snores
yay

it was a cold cold night on plum street
in the little white house Missus Bear was putting Sam to bed
she closed their favorite book and they both blew out the candle
xxx kiss good_night Sam Missus Bear said and she wrapped him all cozy in the blanket that was red
but suddenly she heard a cough
what does a cough sound like
and there sat Sam curled up and small and coughing in his bed
Missus Bear put her arms around Sam
don't you feel well Sam
Sam shook his head xxx xxx
poor Saam
Missus Brown hugged him harder and kissed his warm cheek
you have a cough she said and she dashed down the stairs and up again with
the cough syrup
open wide Sam she said
Sam shook his head
tastes bad he said
yes said his Mama you need to be brave
Sam put the blanket on his head
I don't have a cough xxx xxx

Sam shook the blanket off his head
he opened up then closed his mouth tight
the spoon was too big
too big said Sam xxx xxx
you can do it Missus Bear said
I know you can
Sam opened up then closed his mouth tight
too much syrup on a too big spoon
too much said Sam xxx xxx
Missus Bear rubbed frost off the window and peeked outside
soon it will snow she said open wide Sam and afterward we'll go downstairs and wait for snow
snow
Sam opened wide then very wide
he sputtered and snorted and made a big face but the syrup went down
brave Sam he said
brave Sam
Missus Bear and Sam held hands on the stairs
Sam wore his robe that was blue and his slippers were too
they lit a little fire in the kitchen and made a pot of
tea
and Missus Bear put extra
honey in the tea and it was nice sliding down
after tea they sat in the big purple chair by the window and waited for snow
Missus Bear told a story about a bear called Sam
Sam liked the story so much she told it again
xxx xxx went the cough every now and then
Sam leaned back on his Mama's soft belly which wriggled when she talked
the little fire glowed and the kitchen was warm
and all through the night Missus Bear and Sam sat in the big purple chair and waited
xxx and finally it snowed
but they were fast asleep
the door that's their door you're right
and what did they do the next day
they played in the snow and they made a snow bear you're right
what's that

I think it's a fox because it's orange
fox kind of looks like a wolf
but I think it's a fox
