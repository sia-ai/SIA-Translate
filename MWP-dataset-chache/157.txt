did they did they join
plus the fact that she has cockroaches and she's about ready to go out_of her mind
did they join
well they complained to the management and they have a free pool membership
do they really
but they don't use it very often but she didn't join the tennis club
they do have a free one because of their
well you know that's misrepresentation
