alright
I don't know
what do you think it might have in it
yes oil and perhaps gas
I suppose you can
well here it is a picture of it
yes just like it
perhaps if you put them as they were then they would all fit in
is it an old truck
no I don't think it's an old truck
well
because it's an old truck
no I think that's the way they made it in the factory
I don't know
I suppose you can have in there whatever you'd like to have
what would you like to have in there
because it's a little truck
that one can't be a bigger truck but there are bigger trucks

what is that
anything carrying what
he got some space
some space for what
you used to have little trains and you used to have one of those too
there's one of the cars over there
yes
I really don't know that
I think they must unscrew something and attach the hoses to the fire hydrant
we'll have_to see some day
oh no we can't turn it on
the firemen only can do that
no
because you're a little boy and I'm a lady
we aren't men
we can pretend yes
yes we can pretend
that's not a train
that's a car carrier
it carries cars from one place to another
especially new cars
it gets new cars from the factory and takes them to the place where they're sold
mhm
and Ramblers
do you know any other kind of car
other than a Rambler
what kind do you know
that's all
the people at the factory who made the car painted it
where are you supposed to park them
you didn't put the gas tanks back on that truck
oh do you have a garage
well what're you going to do with these
here the tanks
you're going to do what
perhaps she doesn't have any more
did you ever think of that
no
yes they are tiny aren't they
I don't know
poor Robin gets blamed for everything
is that like the one in your book
oh Adam that's not fair
you just started playing with that
xxx is put the whole bag down here
that's a bouncing ball
you try and hit it with the paddle
do you want to blow
blow again
blow one more time
mhm
you're finished
alright
I don't know why
yes that's fine
here's the bag on the floor
see what
do I see it rolling
it's alright to leave the bag on the floor
she has no more toys
what
do you want to blow
what takes the car
the car carrier
what does a truck carrier carry
no you can't keep this
see you're supposed to try to hit the ball with the paddle in your hand
yes you hit it
pull it out like this so the ball goes up in the air
yes
yes
where does the truck run
where does the truck run
to be prepared for what
oh which street
I don't know
why don't they go down Massachusetts Avenue
and then what town will they go to
so the man can see and not have a bump
oh they should have a bump
why should they
yes they'll have a bump when they run into cars won't they
he can see the Rambler at dark_time
the what
oh the lumber
my_goodness that car sure is pulling something big
the cab
the cab
pulling the trailer
he can't pull both of them can he
I don't know
where are you going
what kind of work are they going to do
derrick work
yes
yes
they should turn right
yes
mhm
right on no left
mhm
I think they should keep going down Broadway street
I guess the hitch is broken
why
because you need to have your nose wiped
no
because we need to use them
no there are no more
that's the top
the part that you open so_that you can pull the kleenex up through there
what
because you put it on there
he has a new little big trailer
they don't burn it down
oh mhm
can what
you mean can a building burn down by itself
yes if someone starts a fire
or if a fire is started in a building and the firemen don't come
to put the fire out
then the building burns down
and who puts it back up
no
they don't build buildings
I don't believe that
how did they put it back up
they put the fire out
who
yes when they put the fire out
to put another fire out
putting the fire out at the school
yes they put the fire out at the school didn't they
and then we saw the derricks tearing the school down
yes
because they didn't want the school to burn all the way down
the hitch wasn't on properly
yes but you can only put one car in there now
because it's in too far
no
I don't know
what do you think
do you think it's a doctor
could be a doctor
that's right
can you put it back together

maybe that's a vine growing on the tree
maybe that's a vine growing on the tree
let's finish this first
that's his tongue isn't it
the reindeer pulls his sleigh
yes perhaps he's parked them
