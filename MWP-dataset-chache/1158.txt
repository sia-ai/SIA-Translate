okay
all along the meadow where the cows grazed and the horses ran there was an old
old stone wall
right
in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty field of
a chatty family of field mice had their
home
but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty
since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw
I think that's
right
is that John
yeah
is that Jim
is that Philip
is that Mary
yeah
they all worked day and night
oh there's a Steve too is there
huh
maybe that's Steve
really
it is
oh
oh that's Philip
maybe this one's Steve
yeah there's Steve he's carrying a little nut
do you xxx know someone named Steve
who do you know named Steve
who's married to aunt xxx
right uncle xxx
they all worked day and night all except Frederick
Frederick why don't you work they asked
I do work said feather said Frederick
Mommy can't talk today
I gather sun rays for the cold dark winter days
what are they carrying
corn
and when they
they have little nuts you're right
right
is that Mary
is that John
right
when they saw Frederick sitting there staring at the meadow they said and now Frederick
I gather colors answered Frederick simply for winter is grey
oh well that's probably
Mary
and John and Steve
uh I think they're carrying some wheat
right out of wheat you can make bread you can make cereal you can make pasta
flour
xxx right it's like straw sort of
once Frederick seemed half asleep
are you dreaming Frederick they asked reproachfully
but Frederick said oh no I'm gathering words
he is
he looks a little
does he look a little sleepy
and he's dreaming also
the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say
what Sweetie
what
hi
oh hi
the winter days came and when the first snow fell the five little field mice took to their hideout in the stones
in the beginning there was lots to eat and the mice told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats
they
could be oh I think maybe this is Frederick with his eyes sort of half open because look at his eyes
you think that looks like Frederick
yeah
right
they were a happy family
but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone
oh yes yes it is
the corn was only a memory
it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting
aw
well they're inside the stones of the wall
well it's all around that's part of the wall right here
right here
right
you think they're kind of sad
then they remembered what Frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words
what about your supplies Frederick they asked
close your eyes said Frederick as he climbed onto a big stone
now I send you the rays of the sun
do you feel how their golden glow
and as Frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer
was it Frederick's voice
was it magic
and how about the colors Frederick they asked anxiously
close your eyes again Frederick said and when he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush they saw the colors as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds
right and purple
you're squeezing the colors in your hands
you're mushing the colors up into your hands
wow
and the words Frederick
Frederick cleared his throat and then as if from a stage he said
who scatters the snowflakes who melts the ice
who spoils the xxx weather who makes it
who grows the four leaf clovers in June
who dims the daylight who lights the
four little field mice who live in the sky
four little field mice like
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers then comes the summer who paints in the
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat and winter is last with little
aren't we lucky the seasons are four
think of a year with one less
that's so great Honey
when Frederick had finished they all applauded
but Frederick they said
you are a poet
Frederick blushed
took a bow and said shyly
that's great Honey good reading
