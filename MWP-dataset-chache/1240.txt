Sleepy didn't
it looks like you have a little food on your sleeve here
should we take this shirt off and put on

panther panther panther
did Daddy play that with you
in the bath
I don't think
oh is that what happens sometimes
I see hm
hm
the ducky rides on the top of the bathtub

the ducky rides on top of the
the sail of the boat
I see
I'm gonna get that little purple
thing for you to wear

xxx you talking to the to the tape
well I'm just talking to the person who's gonna transcribe
this is still November twenty fifth just moments later
you're wearing your little purple purse
it's very nice looking
this is actually a letter to Clare xxx mother
and I'm gonna put it up here with some other mail
that I need
that I need to send in the mail
my little one
oh
okay
we could do that
that's what your old letter to him says it says I went right to a party
wanna stay
say the same thing in your letter
can you sort the silverware for me is that something you could do right now
because it's over there
it needs to be sorted
yeah
yeah
in your letter you wanna say the same thing
alright
well we can do that
mhm
mhm
hm
yeah
I will need to get some paper
and a pen or a pencil to write it down for you
okay uh I don't have pencil and paper right now
but when I get some after I finish putting away the dishes then I will write down what you would like me to say to him
in your letter
I don't think that's a measuring cup I think that might be
the dust
uh
a little brush for sweeping the floor
that is what it is
see
yes
it is
where do you think that would be
oh something came off
whoops
can I put this here
let's see if this is okay to put it right here
where do you think he'll see it
you put it where you think he'll see it
hey
oh you think he'll see it best there
alright
maybe we can also just remind him that we put it there
that might help
that's actually a magazine for Daddy
you smelling something
you smelling the food cooking
oh would you like a tissue to blow it with
would you like a tissue honey
you feeling alright
really
oh you mean because of this
does that feel better now or is it still hurting
you know what you might need to use the potty sometimes that can make your tummy hurt
shall we go together
okay
let's do that
alright
little potty or big potty
hm
can you take off your long john
you don't need to take them all the way off
you can just leave them on
you can still sit on the potty even though they're on your ankles
okay
the book on the floor
oh yeah
okay I'll read this one
it's called lift the lid use the potty
and it goes like this
here is little bunny's brand new purple potty
lift the lid what's inside
oh want me to go back to that page
oh there's the flap
a think that's a waste
uh a waste+basket
it's a toy
what's it doing in there
oh did we skip something
oh the pocket
flap I forgot about that
oh
there's a baby sister
there's the lollipops
why does she keep them in her pocket
I don't know
I don't know
should I turn the page
little bunny's baby sister goes in her diaper
little bunny used to but not anymore
she's making a face
because of the smell
right
she doesn't like the smell
xxx that's before she smells the poopy diaper
hm
the mommy is
changing the baby's diaper
oh she's probably worried about the baby getting a diaper rash
because when you wear a diaper instead of using a potty you can get a diaper rash
why did you tear it off
I have no idea do you remember why
I don't know why
now when little bunny has to go it's potty time
she pulls down her pants and lifts the lid
she can probably pull down her own big kid pants
after little bunny goes it's time to wipe
want me to read the little book
time to use the potty
sit sit sit I sit and wait
turn the page
then it says
time to wipe
yippee I used the potty
little bunny sits on the potty and goes
after little bunny goes it's time to wipe
hm what's there
time to wash and dry those hands while Mommy pours the pee pee in the toilet
then it's time to flush
whoosh
bye bye pee pee
oh okay
did you skip a flap
what's in
the box
what's in her box
big kid pants
there was a flap there it's not there anymore
you tore it off
when you were
a younger toddler
because maybe you didn't understand that you shouldn't tear flaps off of flap books
I don't know there must have been a flap there too
do you remember when there was stickers on this
you know if you wanted to you could get
we could get some
potty stickers and we could put them there
but start putting them there instead of
see because that potty poster is almost full
we could use this again
we could a
we could get a bunch of maybe the
we could get a bunch of small stickers that would fit over the numbers
and you could use this again
would you like to do that
well I mean one that wouldn't be too big
we wouldn't want one that would be
that would cover up more than one number
maybe I could find some
that you could use
that would be the right size
and we could even take it with us when we go on our journey and that way you could have potty stickers on your journey
should we take a potty with us on our journey
yeaah
maybe because she's too short and he's tall enough to reach
which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home
okay we could bring the bunny potty
should we bring the seat too maybe
this one
should we bring a stool with us
oh I see
when we go on our journey
at the vacation house
do you wanna use this one
alright
okay I think you're ready to wipe aren't you
that's the end of the book
oh alright
go ahead then
you know if your tummy ever hurts like that again
your stomach
then you'll know that maybe it's time to use the potty
remember your xxx
you came to me and you said my tummy is hurting
and I said sometimes that means you need to use the potty
and I was right
that's number thirteen
this whole thing
it's toilet paper
twenty nine
twenty eight

eggs

nobody likes to be eaten
it's uncomfortable
well that's something you'll learn when you get a little older

no the bird can't go in there
well the bird is big it's not flat the paper dolls are flat

it's got shape
is it
a calendar
it's a calendar
it's a calendar
is there another book you'd also like to read
oh puppy trouble xxx haven't read that for quite a long time
I think that puppy's got a jump+rope in her mouth
you think so
the jump+rope is all tangled up with the letter e
I don't know why but it looks like the e is going to fall
hey fall is another word that begins with f
well it looks like it will
does it look like it's gonna stay on the shelf to you
kay
uhoh the puppy's loose
what's the puppy inside of Naima
usually that's called a crate
an animal goes around in a crate
or some people might call it a dog carrier
xxx I would call it a crate
xxx opened the door
he's not supposed to do that he's suppose to stay in there
until someone comes to take him out
he's not supposed to get out of his crate by himself
he's supposed to come out only if someone comes to let him out
well he probably just came
I think that puppy just arrived
and a crate is something that
people use to take animals from one place to another
oh xxx read it
watch out for the plant
it is falling down in this picture when you move the tab it starts to fall down
because the puppy is using his teeth to
yank it
let go of Kitty's pillow
you know you could say Mommy read this please instead of just saying do this
better not pull that
the puppy looks startled
I think the puppy didn't know there were so many things in the closet that were going to come falling out when he opened the door
that's a messy closet
actually it doesn't have any xxx words to read
what's that puppy doing now
that's a show about an elephant isn't it
okay
whoa what's happening here
I think they're being mischievous animals
mischievous
can you say it
mischievous
like that's being mischievous like you were mischievous this evening by taking the laundry cart and taking it out into the hallway
where it doesn't belong
and you were mischievous when you were tearing up the tissue paper and putting it all over the floor just now
you are mischievous just like an animal
