your knife handle and the handle in the picture are different
uhhuh yours is bigger than the picture
what did you do today
did you go to school today
when are you going to go to school
oh
just don't throw it at people
because he's mean
he's a mean pirate
where
earrings
he probably stole them
what
I've already read about ten books today
tomorrow we're going to get our seeds
no we're gonna go to a different store
because the other store still isn't open yet
well if you're gonna be mean
go live with the pirates
we don't want mean boys cutting everything up
wow it's really dark already
I didn't realize it was so late
it will be tomorrow no doubt about it
hey look Robin_Hood has a knife and a bow and arrow
see this little sword right here
do you wanna go help me bring the stuff in from the car
who else has knives
how about Peter Pan

yours is almost a sword
it's not raining any more
oh
swings on a rubberband
pop goes the rubberband
down goes the monkey man
did you see that
what a klutzy Tarzan
down goes the monkey man
this could be an anteater's tongue too
here comes the anteater
is it dry
what are you going to use this on
no it didn't
it's at the very top of each of them
know what else you can use it for
to rake the ground in the garden smooth
no some of it didn't go on very smoothly
okay would you like some cheese
the last size seems just right
here you go
no you said you wanted this much
did you throw it on the floor Abe
where's the other part
if you want to
gosh it sort_of looks like a triceratops
yeah a triceratops does have three
I think it's getting a little chilly now Abe
they probably have big jackets on too
that's a lightweight jacket you'd need to put on your
no you'd have_to put on your winter jacket
no just stay in
what seeds do you want to plant tomorrow
Abe we were just out
if you want to put your big winter jacket on then you can go out
I was just outside
and it was cold
I said you could go out if you put on your winter jacket
if you want to go out put your winter jacket on

oh you know what
you could put your cowboy jacket on under your blue jacket
that way you could wear both of them
I don't know if it would fit over your blue jacket
we could try it
oh hey we could put your blue sweatshirt on
and then put on your cowboy jacket
I bet that would work
