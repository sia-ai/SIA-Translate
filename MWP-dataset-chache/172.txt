as they were walking along Tupty saw a beautiful red flower and stopped to pick it
as she bended down Puddy pushed away the blankets and jumped out_of the carriage very quickly and quietly so Tupty didn't see him Tupty turned around and oh her Puddy was gone
she got so worried

have you seen my cat Puddy
and the boy who's playing the policeman says
oh she's right over there
she points he points to Puddy
and Tupty is very relieved
mhm
but that's only part of the problem

so now they have_to get her back
so the policeman gets down on his knees and says
here Puddy

all of a sudden the policeman jumps to grab Puddy and she runs away very quickly
and he falls and doesn't pick her up what do you think the little boy who is riding his bicycle thinks about this

and she loses her hat
it goes on the policeman's head
and Puddy hops back into the pipe and runs the other way
Tupty and the policeman get out_of the water and they're dripping wet
and they come through the pipe
and when they come through the pipe there's Puddy who is caught by the little boy who was following them
