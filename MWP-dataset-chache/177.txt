she's all dressed up though huh
I'm sure her mommy gave her some clothes
a necklace
you didn't wear your necklace today
there's the necklace right
and a purse
looks like a purse
xxx dressed up just like her
okay so she's wheeling her kitty+cat in a baby stroller
and what happens
yeah
and then
the kitty cat hopped out_of the stroller
that's a pretty flower it's a pretty orange flower
why do you think the kitty cat ran out
didn't want to be a baby
hmm this has some deep meanings I think
okay and so what happens
she turns around and she's very unhappy
she goes
ah
oh no
my kitty cat
my kitty cat
I lost it
I lost it
so the kitty hid
and the flower goes flying through the air
and where's the kitty cat
right
right over behind the tree
okay so what does she do
she goes
help
help help help
find a policeman quick
right
who does she find being a policeman
yeah
it's not a real policeman huh
it's a pretend policeman
a little boy pretending to be a policeman
so who's
what's he doing
he's playing with his his other little friend
he's playing on a tricycle
so what do what do you think the little girl is saying to the policeman
the kitty's lost
please help me find it
so what's the policeman do
that's right
he looks right behind her and says
oh you dumb lady
your kitty cat's right behind ya
if you'd turn around and look
use your eyes huh
is that what he says
I think he's got a big yellow whistle
that would be fun to play
so is the little girl happy
hmm so
I bet you it's his
these are all three brothers and sisters maybe
this is a big sister and that's a big brother and that's a little brother
kinda like Titch
yeah
maybe that's that's the way it is
I betcha
so is the cat happy
they're all happy
but is the cat happy
no
the cat doesn't look too happy
so they try to go catch the cat
the little brother is kinda fed up with them
he's
they're playing so silly
so he's walking away
he says
ah you guys
go play
I don't need I don't need to play with you guys anymore
and the kitty cat looks like he'd rather be some place else too
so the brother goes to try to catch him
and what happens
yeah
what happens to the little the brother
well lookee right there
the sister steps on the brother's coat and he trips and falls down
kerplunk
the whistle broke too
fell off its string
and the kitty cat ran away
and what does he think
yeah
shall we give these guys names
since they don't have names in this book
who should this be
that should be Titch
Titch Cowboy
okay then who should be the sister
Mary
Mary Mother
and who should be the brother
some great names
Pete Policeman Mary Mother and Titch Cowboy
okay that's better
alright so now they're going to try to find him
he thinks they're going to catch him for sure
so they're all tiptoeing after him
and Peter Policeman says
come here kitty
come here
he's beckoning like Michael the Policeman did right
okay and Mary Mother is pulling up her dress so she doesn't fall on her nose again
was it Mary that fell down or Peter that fell down
ya Peter
okay and Titch is just kinda um coming along for the ride okay
so where's the kitty+cat going
inside that big pipe sewer pipe
uh oh so Peter Policeman climbs in
uh oh uh oh
this looks kinda of worrisome
is is water
this is a little river or creek out in the other end
and the kitty cat is staying up on top
he's the he's not going to get wet
but I bet you Peter might
so Peter starts walking through
and I bet you Mary's going to fall
and Titch Titch is sitting up on top
and I was right
what happened
that's right
Peter just fell right in
went right in the water
kerplunck
and Mary almost did but she saw Peter laying in the water so she look up
and what did she see
the kitty cat
do you think that they'd really want to get that kitty cat back now
or are they getting mad do you think
ya
maybe
well the kitty cat's up the tree
what's going to happen now
well Peter it looks like Peter is trying to help her get out
and she getting out and out and out
and all of a sudden she loses her balance and falls right on Peter back in the water
and at first the kitty cat
what do you think how think the kitty cat feels
here
here he's happy
what about here
maybe he's afraid
well because here he's kinda the cause why everybody getting into trouble
and he's afraid people are going to be mad at him
you know
kinda like how you were feeling the other day about the books right
the books that Wendy got for her birthday
okay so what happens
they go kerplunck nose
right into the water
and all ya s
where're their heads
where are their heads here
that's right
these are their feet and the kitty cat looking inside the thing
where are they
where are they
so
he's wearing the wrong hat
he's wearing Mary Mother's hat
and Mary Mother is all drenched
and the kitty cat runs right back in the sewer pipe
okay I think they're getting madder and madder
Peter Policeman doesn't look too happy at alright then huh
so they climb back in the sewer pipe and they crawl through it
and what happened
Titch caught the kitty cat
he didn't even try
he didn't have_to get wet
he just kinda took his own time and managed to catch the kitty cat all by himself
and so he hands it to to Peter Policeman
and what happens
his hat falls off
and then what else happens
where's the kitty cat
on Peter Policeman's head
and Peter can't see
and he says
help
help
get this cat off my head
I've got a cat on my head
and what do you think Mary Mother's doing
oh I see what happens
let's go back
let's go back a page now I see what happened
we we missed
Titch had caught the cat and then he dropped it right on Peter's head
that's what happened
so Mary Mother is saying
Titch Titch Cowboy
you should never drop a cat on your big policeman brother's head
well so Peter Policeman chases the cat again
and the cat's climbing a tree an look at Peter's hair
isn't that funny
he wo
his hair looks like a cat that cat on the hair the hair of a cat
it's all sticking up straight
looks like he has some scratches on his face
from the kitty cat's claws
he really doesn't look too happy then huh
alright so the cat climbs a tree
it's a cute book
the cat climbs a tree
and Peter climbs the tree
and he's going to catch that cat
and what is Mary Mother doing
here
frowning
and she's saying
oh no Peter's going to get hurt
oh the kitty cat going to get hurt
oh my real mommy's going to be mad at me
and
what is Titch doing
he's smiling
he says
hey
lookee up there
there's a cat in the tree
and my brother's up in the tree

looks like Peter caught the cat
and Mary's saying
oh thank goodness

like we taught you but
now how does Peter get down
he's got a problem
he's got the cat but how's he get down

and he gets down the hard way kinda like Pooh came down
how Pooh came down out_of his tree
a branch breaks
and what happens to the kitty cat
he's falling
and what's happening to Peter
yeah but he's falling too
so what happens over here
who caught the kitty cat
the mother caught the kitty cat
and who caught Peter

there's Titch's hand I see right there
well so now they're all going home
this time the kitty cat is proud of himself he didn't he didn't he didn't get out+smarted by anybody
and Peter is kinda all broken up in little pieces from his fall
he doesn't look too happy
