xxx Horton hatches the egg
this is a long one do you wanna read a shorter one
this one
you gonna help me read
sighed Maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg I'm tired and I'm bored and I've kinks in my
from sitting just sitting here day after day it's work how I hate it I'd much rather
right
I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest if I could find someone to stay on my
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
then Horton the elephant passed by her
right
hello called the lazy bird smiling her best you've nothing to do and I do need a rest
would you like to sit on the egg in my nest
the elephant laughed why of all silly things I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small mam and I am so
immense
tut tut answered Maisy I know you're not small but I'm sure you can do it no trouble
just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind come be a good fellow I know you
I can't said the elephant please begged the bird
I won't be gone long sir I give you
I'll hurry right back why I'll never be missed
very well said the elephant since you
you want a vacation go fly off and take it I'll sit on your egg and I'll try not to
I'll stay and be faithful I mean what I say toodleloo sang out Maisy and fluttered
hm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
the first thing to do is to prop up this
and make it much stronger that has to be done
before I get on it I must weigh
then carefully tenderly gently he crept
up the trunk to the next where the little egg
slept
then Horton the elephant smiled now that's that and he sat and he sat
he's sitting on it he's keeping it warm
and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a
it poured and it lightning it thundered and rumbled this isn't much fun the poor elephant
I wish she'd come back because I'm cold and I'm wet I hope that that Maisy bird doesn't
but Maisy by this time was far beyond reach enjoying the sunshine way off in
and having such fun such a wonderful rest decided she'd never
great
let me grab the phone ringing
sure Sweetie
yes let me get it for you
let me get you some cold water
there's your ball
okay sweets
so Horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves
and then came the winter the snow and sleet and icicles hung from
his trunk and his feet but Horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze I'll stay on this egg and I won't let it
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through and then came the spring time with troubles
his friends gathered round and they shouted with glee look Horton the elephant's up in a
they taunted and teased him they yelled how absurd old Horton the elephant thinks he's a
they laughed and they laughed and they all ran away and Horton was lonely he wanted to
he sat on the egg and he
there's your water
I meant what I said and I said what I meant and elephant's faithful
no matter what happens this egg must be tended
but poor Horton's troubles were far far from
so for while Horton sat there so faithful so kind three hunters came sneaking up softly
behind
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start three rifles were aiming right straight at his
oh no
did he run he did not
Horton stayed on that nest he held his head high and threw out his
he looked at the hunters as much as to say shoot if you must but I won't
I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephant's faithful
but the men didn't shoot much to Horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with
look they all shouted can such a thing be an elephant sitting on top of a
it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just
and it's just what we'll do
we'll take him alive why he's terribly funny we'll sell him back home to a circus for
oh my gosh
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on they dug up his tree and put him inside with Horton so sad he practically
oh no
up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet
and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and
and out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh
what a trip
rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray and Horton sat day after day after day
