oh
is he making a big road
he's going to drive it over and to the dump
which is over there to the crane
the crane is going the crane is the crane is going to put it
is the crane going to put it in the big box
he drives down with a big load
oh
and up again
makes a big noise
see why
see why it makes so much
how come sweetheart
why does it make so much
there really is a lot but the crane has_to pile it up has_to pile it up
oh I see
the crane piles it up
I put it back in the dump truck and the dump truck puts it in the crane when the crane comes back up
he's not going to play any more basketball then
no he can squeeze in response to a direct squeeze of the hand but he hasn't said a word yet
he's had head injuries and he was semiconscious but he is fully conscious now
they maintain that he can't breathe but that couldn't possibly be the case because he didn't have that all the time

this is on right now

oh I would expect that
we never realized it was that bad
we knew that if Zelco didn't put it together again she would never use her arm fully
boy you are really talking a good story
you came home to Carol
I didn't realize that it was
