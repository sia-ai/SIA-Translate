do you remember what this rock is called
what's it called
it's called Pride rock
home to my good friend king Mufasa and his lovely wife queen Sarabi
on this particular morning animals from all over the Pride lands had journeyed to Pride rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub Simba
as part of the celebration I had a special duty
do you know what kind of animal he is
what does he look like to you
looks kind of like a mandrill to me
you think so
hm okay
I cracked open a gourd dipped my finger inside and made a mark on Simba's forehead

the elephants trumpeted with their trunks the monkeys jumped up and down

not far from the ceremony in a cave at the back side of Pride rock a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled
life's not fair I shall never be king
who's this
oh that's Scar
who was jealous of Simba's position as the next king
moments later Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba
Zazu Mufasa's trusted advisor also appeared
you should have been first in line
I was first in line until the little hair ball was born said Scar and he stalked out of the cave
that's Zazu
yeah
before long Simba grew into a healthy playful young cub
early one morning he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride rock
as they looked out at the rising sun Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride lands
yes Honey

are you makin little pieces
yeah
would you like me to read the book to you Honey
you wanna finish Lion king or you wanna read Franklin
alright let's see where we were
later as Simba headed down the path he ran into Scar
hey uncle Scar guess what I'm gonna be king of Pride land
of Pride rock
my dad just showed me the whole kingdom and I'm gonna rule it all
Scar looked slyly at the young cub
he didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border did he
well no he said I can't go there
oh he's right said Scar it's far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
when Simba returned home he found his friend Nala and her mother Sarafina visiting with Sarabi
come on I just heard about this great place he said
the mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go as long as Zazu went with them
Simba and Nala raced across the Pride lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird
Nala led him through many herds of animals until they finally lost him
once the cubs were free of Zazu Simba pounced on Nala
then Nala flipped Simba onto his back
they tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine littered with elephant skulls and bones
Simba looked around and gasped
this is it we made it
before the cubs could explore any farther Zazu tracked them down
we're way beyond the boundary of the Pride lands he said
and right now we're all in very real danger
suddenly three hyenas slithered out of the eye sockets of an elephant skull
frightened Simba Zazu and Nala jumped back
it was Banzai his partner Shenzi and the always laughing Ed
Banzai sneered a trio of trespassers
Zazu tried to lead the cuds cubs to safety but Zanzai grabbed Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down
the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
you know what Sweets can we keep that on the table
we don't want it to get stuck all over the rug right
nope
let's still read Lion king
okay
uh the hyenas circled their prey licking their chops
what's the hurry we'd love you to stick around for dinner they said
while the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom Simba Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away
but the hyenas weren't distracted for long
they gave chase and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could
finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones
just when it looked as if it was all over for the young cubs Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw
if you ever come near my son again he said
the hyenas slinked away and Mufasa glared at Simba
you deliberately disobeyed me I'm very disappointed in you
Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son
Simba peered up at his father
I was just trying to be brave like you he said
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble he said
Dad we're pail we're pals right and we'll always be together right
Mufasa looked up at the stars
Simba let me tell you something my father told me
look at the stars
the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars so whenever you feel alone just remember those kings will always be there to guide you and so will I
do you remember where did we see stars on the ceiling
did we go to the science museum in Boston
and we went to that planetarium
where all the stars were all over the sky
wasn't that neat
yeah
is there any Playdoh on the floor
thank you very much
Mommy has to go blow her nose one more time
I'll be right back
somewhere there is xxx xxx
okay
is there another sut oh another song coming up was that the last one
I think it may have been
I think perhaps so
oh yeah
okay Baby
that is a whole lot of Playdoh whoopie
oh okay one big ball huh
wow good luck
that's a big job
doo doo doo doo
wow
nice going Honey
oh alrighty
let's see
the following day Scar invited Simba to join him in the gorge
when they arrived Scar turned to his young nephew
you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
moments after he left Scar signaled the hyenas who chased a herd of wildebeest directly towards Simba
from a distance Mufasa noticed the rising dust
Scar appeared quickly at his side and said stampede in the gorge Simba's down there
without waiting a second Mufasa took off to save his young son
Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests
he found Simba grabbed him by the nape of his neck and put him on a nearby ledge
suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede
desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which star Scar stood looking down on him
help me Brother he said
Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper long live the king
and then let go of Mufasa
ooh gotta watch that Playdoh
Simba peered over the ridge
ooh Sweets can you pick that up please
uh
no I think you can pick it up Sweetie because you dropped it on the floor
can you pick it up before it gets stepped on Sweetie
alright well I'll finish reading the book when you pick your Playdoh up
what are you making
really
oh
it looks like something very neat
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
you're a little stuffy
a little bit stuffy
yeah
what should we do with that Playdoh that's on the ground
because I see a piece right between us
and I'm still waiting for you to pick it up
that's good cutting Honey
squishy
what color do you think that Playdoh looks like
a little red
no
it does look like grey you're right
what else is grey
oh the sky is blue and grey
wow
what about cars does anyone you know have a grey car
you're right Nancy does have a grey car
wow

thank you very much
thank you
all back together into one big pile
ooh it's so squishy
whoa
that is some very hairy squishy Playdoh
yeah
okay
alrighty
okay which one should we read first
Paddington
do you remember what this one's called
what's this one called
Paddington's lucky day
wow
one day not long after Paddington went to live with the Browns at number thirty two Windsor gardens Mrs Brown thought she would take him out shopping
we're going to the Portobello Road explained Judy
it's a big outdoor market quite near here
you should bring your pocket money added Jonathan there's a lot to see
do you remember that I told you that Mommy and Daddy went to Portobello Road and bought something
do you remember what it was that we bought
you know the there's a little picture above your armoire in your room
it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl
and Daddy and I bought that at Portobello Road
yeah
before we even had you
because we knew we were gonna have a little Lily
yeah
Mommy might have_to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay
we'll finish this first though
Paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off
suddenly they turned a corner and Paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world
a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in
one store was even having its picture taken
that's a new supermarket said Judy there must be something special going on there
Paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass
perhaps I could do some shopping for you Mrs Brown he asked hopefully
Mrs Brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon
but Jonathan told her not to worry even Paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said
what goes in must come out
we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added Judy
Paddington felt most important as he entered the store
he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted Mrs Brown's shopping list
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade
he could certainly see why it was called a super market
what do you like to get at the supermarket
you like to get drinks at the supermarket
that's true we do have_to get some drinks don't we we have_to get some juice and some milk
what else do you like to get at the supermarket
lemonade
excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket
um even more drinks wow
that's a lot of drinks
his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels
may I suggest you use one of these sir he called
you can take as much as you want now he continued
can I really exclaimed Paddington
the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy
Paddington looked most impressed
in that case he said I think I'll have two baskets just to make sure
the more Paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked
he felt sure Mrs Brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries
the other customers looked on in amazement
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady
what's she wearing
she is wearing some glasses you're right
whoop
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching Paddinton with interest
since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men
and as Paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap
what do you see in his basket
yeah what do you see anything that you recognize
I think I see some
right there's some chicken over there and some
right bananas
and
celery that's right that's celery
do you know what this one is here
that is actually looks just like lettuce that I think is cauliflower
right
yeah
you don't
Mommy likes cauliflower
really okay
really which cousins don't like cauliflower
oh they don't like cauliflower either
oh none of the three of you like cauliflower huh
well you're right Daddy doesn't like cauliflower
I think Auntie likes cauliflower
and Mommy likes cauliflower
great
Paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy
and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets
well done said the lady handing him a ticket
I hope you've brought a truck with you
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here
Paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw
hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares
he opened his suitcase and peered inside
but I've only got a nickel
yeah
what's he going to do
oh no
looking up Paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him
watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late
with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter
Paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the Browns rushed into the store to see what was going on
all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being
she has a surprised face I think
she's going what happened
that's what she's saying
where's Paddington
because he's hiding under all the groceries
there he is
great
you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult
a prize echoed the Browns
the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall
this young bear he said happens to be our one thousandth thousandth customer today
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply supply of groceries
all of which said Judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet
even in supermarkets agreed Jonathan
Paddington sniffed the air happily
I like the Portobello Road he said I think I shall always do my shopping here from now on
