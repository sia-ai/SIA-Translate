no
do you want to stay over here by yourself alone

and he got upset because his was different
I remember that
okay let's put this away
these have_to be taken back to school tomorrow
I'll take them back because I have_to see Mr Schaffner anyway
okay
because when you go to elementary school they have these meetings and they're called parent teacher conferences

I know you have a green lollipop
is that where the conferences are
faculty meeting
do you know what the word faculty means
what does it mean
faculty lounge

faculty means teachers
the faculty in school are the teachers in school so when you say the faculty you mean the group of teachers that teach in the school
that's the faculty
in your car you mean in your kindergarten class
altogether I think about seventy five
and there are how many children in David's nursery school
