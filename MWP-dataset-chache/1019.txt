we're talking about
no no we're talking about when we've gone swimming there that one time in the summer
we were all freezing
remember you were going to give me a little something if I wouldn't get out_of the water
was I really
yes
and I never got anything
you didn't need anything
now I think he's the sore sort
you didn't have those lessons
you didn't know how to swim
I didn't know how to swim
no you didn't need the lessons because you didn't know how to swim
they taught me nothing
I don't agree Jenny
I think they did teach you something and if you'd paid attention you would have learned even more
one thing that kept you though Jinky is what they did is they kept you in the water when you had just learned to swim
that's the xxx swim
they were trying to teach me to dive
you know how I learned to dive
watching J_J dive
well very often only people who really think they
I was so embarrassed that I couldn't dive that I just dove
you still don't dive right
when we'd go to butter+milk over this summer she never dove
she she has the notion of diving
I know how to dive
I know how to dive
it's not a jump
nope
when you roughly get in head first
I've never seen you dive
I've seen her dive at that Cass_park
yeah
I was diving all the time Dana
you were doing it at the farm
the swimming pool at the farm
the thing of it is she doesn't have the kind of spring so_that she goes up and down so her feet come straight down in the water
I do it like a
well you don't do it even then you leave your knees bent
you're doing pretty well Jennifer considering that you've had no instruction
you're now at the stage where someone could really teach you how to do a pretty one
you think
Dana does the same thing as me
I know
is J_J taking swimming lessons this year
he's past shark
boy standards have really come down
hush a minute
what lessons was he taking Jenny
it's junior lifesaver I think
is it through the Y
yes
I haven't even passed
no honey it's at the high school
okay we've got_to call the Y and find out about their lessons
not about their competitive teams but the lessons
you guys I haven't even passed
I just passed intermediate two years ago
now I know how Jay swims and the whole notion that he that any kid underage well even Jason's age
Jason can't
Jason can't swim very well
well I know that but what I'm saying is that I don't understand what's happening
I don't think the programs a good program is what I'm leading to
he's been taking swimming lessons a long time and he's gone straight ahead
I mean a person just can't go there for a long long time and not pass something
I think you're probably right
I think he really is learning something
well what we wanted to find out about are those lessons
Jenny's not interested in the competitive business
not until I get to something like shark
I'm interested in the competitive business
you needn't tell me that
I can guess that
I think Dana can you arrange to go with Rachel one afternoon
yeah
okay now here's one of the problems we're looking at
Jennifer let me just explain this to you
the lessons usually are one day a week
Jenny that's on the computer
every time dad starts talking you go xxx professor
what
sorry
you can start over if you want
the and the swimming team thing is every day
mom stop doing that it's really distracting me
well don't let it distract you
well why xxx
okay
did you hear what I said though Jenny
yeah
okay
so you have_to decide how often you want to swim
do you want to swim
once a week
once a week
okay then it's alright
I'm soon going to be up to him
in about a month
maybe not Jenny
that's true
if you're not it's nothing damaging
they should teach me how to dive with my legs straight
so we've got_to find about the Y lessons for Jinky and we've got_to find out about the Y's competitive program for Dana
no
the high school's competitive thing
it's in the high school
no its not
but it's the Y program
Rachel isn't in the Y program
yes she is honey
Rachel's in the Y program out at Teagle
that's the competitive team
the lessons that they give at the high school
yeah
the high school is so warm
it's even warmer than the small pool in the xxx right
oh goody maybe you'd just like to take lessons in it right
uhhuh but it's got a basketball net and a diving board
I think I'm about ready to turn in for the night
oh I wonder if the news is coming on
for what
for what
turn it off if you're going to have that on mom why are you listening to the news
because something may have happened that I want to know about
yeah there have been so many assassinations that you begin to suspect that he died
mom you said that you'd loan me ten cents
now
now
now
uhhuh
but I don't have it now now now
my god you don't even have it in the kitchen
I hate it the way you tease that way
it's not funny
well you don't do that
don't touch her Dana
why'd you do that
wait a minute
wait a minute xxx
Dana you come over here
you clear the table and you do the dishes
I don't clear the table
that's her job
it's nicer to get it over with quickly
I can't wait until Halloween
what do I want to be for Halloween
how about a chimney sweep
what about a letterman
what were you thinking of
letterman
how about Orphan_Annie
what about Letterman
letterman
that's a joke that wouldn't go off
I don't think that anybody
when you did it it was very much the central focus so because Electric_Company had just appeared
you should be a Cornell xxx
just be a Cornell professor
that will freak people out
are you a professor
yes
disgusting isn't it
no
he's Bo_Derek
I think it's going to be a long squalid summer
it might be considered a squaw winter
what do you mean
it's going to be hot
that's a little ridiculous
dad what are you going to be for Halloween
a cocktail waitress
a cocktail waitress yes
a nurse
no a cocktail waitress
maybe a nurse
I prefer longer dresses
well I have good legs
maybe I could wear a cocktail waitress's dress
Jenny you are going to dry tonight
you'll have_to wear pantyhose
it's almost below zero
hey honey hey anybody want to finish this off
it's awfully good
what did I do
did you see this hand
it seems to have a mind of its own
and mom's going to ground it
yes I definitely think that this hand should stay home
don't drop it whatever you do
don't drop it
but I definitely think that the other hand
why don't you set it down gently
I think that the other hand should definitely stay away from home though
no no just the hand
only the hand is grounded
don't drop the hand
the rest of you can go anywhere you want to
don't drop it
don't
just set it down gently
you mean I'm going to get punched
just don't drop it
I don't intend to
it might get mad
don't drop it
maybe it ought_to be grounded for an additional week
well if you drop it you'll see what will happen
okay set it down now
let go mom
let go
let go
say it again
let go
please let go
just let go
hey Dana can your right hand stay away from home now
hey I wonder how many times those vocabulary words are going to xxx
leave the thing alone Jennifer
I didn't turn it off
did you see her
she wants me to let her turn this thing off
why do you want to turn it off Jennifer
I think you should ground her foot
I think you should ground her hand
sit in your own chair Jennifer
sit in your own chair
now sit in your own chair
sit up
thank_you
Jennifer why don't you leave the room for a while
Jenny you go do your piano practice please
I want you to work through your lesson and I want you to be sure that it sounds good to your ears

Jennifer's rather excited to think that she's going to get a first place ribbon
for what
oh
do they give first place ribbons
uhhuh

isn't that cute
xxx probably not
but we've got a chance
we've got_to win all the rest of our games

bacon is one hundred ten calories per inch stick
how did you know that
I looked on this chart that xxx has
that's a_lot_of calories
I know
but you need calories
it's just that if you get too many then you'll get fat
I know that
so there are xxx really too many calories for what you get
like a gum drop
oh man
how many calories in a gumdrop
I'm not sure
it doesn't say
I would guess three hundred
in one gumdrop
no
uhhuh
no
a gumdrop is about this size
it probably has about fifty calories though
no
I'm amazed
how about big ones
she meant one of those bigger ones
still not three hundred
no couldn't be Dana
yogurt is like five hundred
three hundred
a carton of yogurt is probably more like two hundred
that's why people eat it when they're on diets
that's got a_lot_of calories
but it's very filling and it's very nutritious
yeah xxx but xxx the taste
do you not like yogurt
I like it but
do you ever have a chance to get it for school lunch
no
too expensive for me
look your butter didn't melt
that's the one you buttered
will you pass the salt please
that's what would be nice to look at that sheet about
doesn't say anything about bussing
actually it's on that other sheet

doesn't Angie go to the bus stop
Angela won't be going there any more though
