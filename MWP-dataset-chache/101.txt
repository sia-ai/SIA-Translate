there're lots_of little bugs running round on the ground
what kind of buggy did you have in mind
real buggies

what
did you know I love you
how did you know

what does it mean if I'm your parent
I had you
I made you
yeah
in a way I did
can I do it all my myself
yeah right
how do I get that sperm in there
you're right
yeah
who was that
alright
you wanna hear what you said
there please
this is an extremely important job
I need to figure something out about these glasses of water
see this glass of water
how much water do I have in there
half
okay
half a cup of water in this blue glass
would you pour this water in this brown glass please for me
okay
how much water do I have in there
half
do I have the same amount of water in the brown cup as I had in the blue cup
yes
now would you pour this water in this plain cup for me
this big tall skinny cup
oh
look how much water I have in there
how much water do I have
do I have the same as in the brown cup
I don't
how come
you mean it's more than half a cup o
but wait a minute
pour it back in the brown cup a minute
it's a little more in which cup
in the glass cup
now do I have the same amount of water as I had
why not
it has more in the big skinny cup because it has a different shape bottom
but don't I have the same amount of water even if I put it in the other cup
how come
you poured it back in the plain cup er in the skinny cup
mean it goes it fills more of the plain cup
I don't understand what you're trying to tell me
I see
I see
now let's pour it in this
alright
pour it in that cup and see what you have
now
this cup and this cup are the same
right
do I have the same amount of water as I had when I started in this blue cup
oh
you're gonna pour it and see
alright
yes
in the cups that are the same I have the same amount of water
you gonna pour it back in the other cup
it's the same
you'll see
now
pour that in the little blue cup
do I have the same amount of water
no
how come
we'll see
are you gonna put it back in the in the tall white cup
that fills the cup all the way up
the short now the short wide cup gets filled all the way up and the tall narrow cup gets filled all the way up
you're pouring back and forth
no
are you all done
alright
try it backwards and
okay
short wide into the taller identical cup
do you have the same amount
there's your water level xxx again
pours back into the short white cup
I see
now I wanna ask you a very important question
if this were chocolate milkshake which glass would you like to drink the milkshake out of
okay
you pour it into the cup
so that's the tall narrow cup
why would you like your milkshake in that cup instead of any one of the other cups
I see
but wouldn't it be the same amount of milkshake
I see
it looks better
you done with the water
okay
oh
you're gonna drink the water up
that's a good idea
that's a very fine idea
okay
how about some lunch
I still didn't wash my hair
they'll be back and I haven't washed my hair
yeah
I better not do that one
when they hear we had such a silly time together
