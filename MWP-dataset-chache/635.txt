no no Paul
Adam is playing with the airplane
oh why is it doing that
oh that's not an accident
how does an airplane come down
does it come straight down
he drives
why does he do that
drive
because it doesn't have a motor
I don't really know where a motor is on an airplane
why don't you ask Ursula
perhaps she knows
this is the landing wheel
after you get up in the air it fold back
because it has a motor and it has a pilot to drive it
I guess it's misplaced
it must be lost
no in Robin's home
what doesn't move
what's the matter Paulie
oh no I don't think you should throw it
oh no I don't think you're supposed to do that
it's not a real airplane
why do I put my hand on it
I don't know
it's just not in here
it's just lost
then wind it up again
why can't you
how can a what
get an airplane when its up in the sky
well it can't because a bulldozer doesn't what
what does an airplane do
well does a bulldozer
why
you know
a bulldozer doesn't fly
it doesn't have any wings
Adam why don't you want to do this yourself
no no don't do that
you may break it and it's Paul's
I don't know
it's going to do what
you're not
well I don't think a horse can fly
I don't suppose he can catch it

I don't know which is better for you
now push yourself with this foot
that's right
you change feet so you can back up

so_that you would not break it
this is the bow
you need what to go on it

but it's falling
now why is it falling
when you turn the corner what happens
when you try to turn what happens
do you know why it falls

you didn't have any car
would you like a drink of water
I'm sure we can find a car in here
you hit his finger
no you didn't
I think you hit his finger
don't do that anymore
yes
I don't think so
he's giving you the other one
he didn't really knock it down
because the knots came out
because the knots in the string came out
I tied some knots in the string and they came out
why are you tying it
no I don't really think so
wait
don't run over Paul

hm
Adam does it work with that little bow too

it what
what do you think
at the same time
well how are you going to do that
does that look like a macaroni Adam
that looks like an elbow doesn't it
where're the peppers
what's a pepper
what do you think that is
why don't you look further inside the bag and see what you find
I don't know what do you think that is
well why don't you save that for a little while
oh I think you can
you just have_to get the paper off
go ahead
you're getting it
that's right
what happened
do you have four there Adam
how many do you have
he's not gonna what
oh that's a good idea
each one
which one goes the farthest
which one goes the farthest
and did they have a race Adam
let's put them all in one place to start
did they roll
who won
oh how could they all win
oh
what do you have_to do to win
what is that Adam
Adam what about these cars
aren't these like the cars that Harvey had
why don't you do one thing at a time
oh
what kind of airplane
I didn't know that airplanes had a horn
you said beep beep
who
what's a full house
careful don't break it
does it turn now
no the wheel
what
it turns when it's getting ready to go up in the sky
why did you take my racers
this is green
green like the green light
what does this mean
how could an airplane go through a tunnel
how could it
I don't think it could go under it easily or through it
what should we say Adam
do we go under a tunnel or do we go through a tunnel
Adam if we put this here and we all start racing who wins the race
how does your car win
alright let's try
and who's the winner
yours what
what happens when he has a flat tire
can he keep on driving or does he have_to stop
he can
with a flat tire
Adam did you tell her about your accident
what happened
you caught your toe
no you didn't cut your finger
how did you catch
yes last year
but what happened to your toe
no it got caught in what
his tricycle
was it very bad
it wasn't
we had to use the pliers
no you couldn't
well we can play a guessing game
alright
let's play it
I don't think that's a car
what do you think it is not
you don't think that's a truck
well I don't think that's a bow
no
I think it might be something that flies in the air
I don't think it's an airplane
a spear
no I don't think it's a spear either
what else can fly in the air
a bird
it doesn't have any wings
maybe
you have_to do something to it first
I think perhaps you'll have_to put it together in some way
first you have_to find out what it is
you might not like it
let's think a little while
you don't know
I still think something that flies in the air and maybe you hold on to it with a string
I think so
you mean unwrap
she might have that for Robin
don't you think Robin needs a kite
put it down
you play with something else a minute while I get Paul up
I think you might need some help with that
so the short wouldn't come out
what's a short
what
what are you going to eat on that kite Adam
hi Paul
hi sleepy head
oh you're not a sleepy head now
I think it will
alright
that's the first part
then you have_to take it outside on a windy day
there isn't much wind at all
perhaps tomorrow
no that's a string for what
why do you need string
watch the little cars
you can't
oh you can
let's see if you can
he has a flat tire
oh he didn't have a flat tire
what happens when you win
probably
careful Adam
then what're you going to do with it
when you use that Adam always shoot it away from people
oh no
I think Daddy won't come in again
why would you shoot Indians
I see you've learned how to use it Adam
crawl under the bed
why not
it's dark under there
oh don't do that
now shoot over toward Paul's bed
no because he's not in there sleeping
where did that go
what happened
okay
over that way further
see if you can hit the pillow in Paul's bed
you missed
what happened that time
turn it the other way
yes

Paul what are you reading

oh do you shoot a spear with a bow
a long spear
yes that's not nice to say
oh you silly boy
what're you doing
no no Adam
careful
why does it have what on it
that's a rubber tip so_that it won't do too much damage when it hits something
careful
you did
well you would have hurt yourself
that's right
what's soft
jump on your toe is soft
what do you mean soft
the thread out
because I thought it would be fun to try to knock it down
isn't that fun
oh yes
but it's alright for you to knock it down
