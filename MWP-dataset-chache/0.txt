and Mary's going to tell about what Ross's done this morning
Ross took his bath
mhm
and he threw doo+doo all over the floor
mhm
and when I walked in I saw it
doo+doo doo+doo
uh ca+ca
poo poo
uh poo excuse me
and um
I walked in and saw it
uhuh
and I said
oh_my_goodness
mhm
and Ross looked at me and he said
oh_my_goodness
and then he said
how did he say it
let's hear how he said it
oh he mushed it
oh my
he said oh no
oh_my_goodness
the goodness was mushed but the oh was clear
oh_my_goodness
and then he said
oh my
oh my
was that clear
it was pretty clear considering I I understood
oh_my_goodness
and I was sort of listening
mhm
yeah
and then he said
oh wow
oh wow
I was trying to figure out what that one was but that was clear too
it was clear enough
uhhuh
he doesn't say anything clear
just now
he says don't very clearly
no he doesn't
he says unt
he says du
don
well he doesn't say it clearly though
he doesn't say don't
pretty clear
okay
and then and then just a few minutes ago I gave him a piece of coconut which he had been pointing at and wanting
mhm
and so I gave it to him
and he said thank_you
thank_you
Mary wants to tell us a story about Mike Spratt
I think he means mine
mine
mine
okay
you want to tell us a story about Mike Spratt now Mary
please
oh
mike Spratt came over
and as_soon_as Ross realized that uh I'm not sure this is such a good story
tell it
huh
as_soon_as Mike re Ross realized that Mike was there he began to bring him the uh Leggo dolls
one by one
uhuh
and then he became uh began became involved in a game with Mike
uhuh
where Mike would um this was very nonverbal
mhm
Ross would put the doll oh I know he wanted all the doll back from Mike that was it
after he gave them all to him
so he'd take them one by one
well at least he took the first one and then he'd put it on the window sill
mhm
then he asked Mike for the next one and Mike gave it to him
and he asked Mike for the third one but Mike would not give him the third one until Ross put the second one on the window+sill also
mhm
uh and he tried I guess Mike guided his hand that time
mhm
so the third and fourth time around Ross got the hang of the game
so when people insist on him doing things he will do things
yeah he got the game very very quickly
I agree
I agree it wasn't that interesting
what was that
was that Navajo honey
why don't you get up and talk Ross
