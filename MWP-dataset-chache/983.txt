we sing gratefully
thanking him
god is like a shield protecting us
he's our defender taking care of us
we call him the ancient of days because he is god forever and ever
splendor a great brightness is around god like a tent a pavilion
he is girded with praise as our songs and prayers circle around him
we worship the king
alright Maggie clapping your hands

his wonderful love
our shield and defender
the ancient of days

one door and only one and yet its sides are two
I'm on the inside
on which side are you
you like
remember that song
it says
god is perfect and right and good
he is the king of a perfect kingdom
nothing bad or wrong can live there
sometimes we do bad or wrong things
but god sent Jesus to take the blame for the wrong things
he took the blame as_if it were his fault
that makes us perfect right and good
now we can be in god's perfect kingdom
Jesus is like the door to get there
he is the way to get to god
one door and only one and yet its sides are two
inside and outside
on which side are you
one door and only one and yet its sides are two
I'm on the inside
on which side are you

let's read this book
this one is nice
Jesus you're my friend
dear Jesus will you be my best friend
I already love you and you love me
so how about it
my bible says
you'll always be with me even at nighttime
I love your pretty stars but I don't like the dark
thanks for being with me at night
Jesus I can talk to you anytime anywhere
all day long
and all night long I know you care
thanks for staying awake so you can hear my prayers
Jesus do you ever feel sad
or mad
when I feel sad or mad
I know you're still my friend
I like having a friend like you
be careful
be gentle with the book
gentle
some days nobody can come over to play with me
when I feel lonely I know you are still with me
I like feeling your love
I'm so glad you're my special friend up in heaven
someday I'll bring my friends and we can have a peanut+butter and jelly picnic
thank_you Jesus for being my special friend
I can't see you but I know you are always there
I can feel your love and care
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
