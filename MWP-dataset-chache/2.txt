something like Mommy
he's has never used uppy to ask for food
and one time he used ma_may to ask for objects and things
mostly for food now and or then also very rare
and he uses uppy for any type of action in which he's being propelled by another person through the air
transfer
transferred
transferred from one place to another
but particularly he uses it to get into the house even when he kind of helps himself in
he means to get into the house
help me get in
and kind of help
and when he gets out_of the bath+tub
out_of the high+chair
into the high+chair
into the bath+tub
out_of the bed uh

the one with the stick and then
yes
and then wheels on the other end
yes
with the bell
and he was putting the wheels end of the toy
uhhuh
up onto the window+sill
uhhuh
and he was saying uppy for that
uhhuh
so he was propelling it
he'd say uppy and he was propelling it
and then of course every
time that the bell would fail the little toy would fail
he it would fall down off the ledge and he would
try it again
slam it against the floor
bang it up and down on stamp it on the floor
yeah
and say
no no no no no
right
and then he would try uppy again
and he's really into no now
he just said no

handed her the bear and she took it and she exclaimed over it
ummhm
and then he uh led her rather like a dog saying things that you couldn't understand
right
and would walk towards the house
right
and then look back to s to make sure she was following
right
and she followed him into the house
right
she he took her to his bed+room and showed her the doll
right
and it was very purposeful sort of action
what other fascinating sort of things has he done recently

and he
and he acted like a real person
he's not afraid of the noises
nof
did you notice he's not afraid of the big noises
sometimes a little surprised but not afraid
and he's not afraid of thunder or anything like that

keys
keys
you can say our keys
oh boy
uppy
apa
opa
oppa
oppa
uppy
no keys
keys Ross
keys
no
he seems to like the idea of one single gesture
let's see
some other word he was saying you could just see where he had gotten the intonation but that was about all
he got the whole feel of the word
but he didn't have little details very good
he had the contour really
the intonational contour of it
oh
but keys
like keese
you've got the rising contour and uh
I don't know what else
the aspiration really
things that extended through the whole syllable were probably were better than ones that were just located in part of it
what's that
keys
there he goes
keys
do you want these keys too
tape+recorder
tape+recorder
let me see that better
I don't want to let you uppy Ross
I don't want to let you uppy even though you have your nice little
blanket on now
do you have a sore tooth
do you have a sore tooth
do you have a tooth coming in
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
he's doing a little chant
oh there's Titus dingalinging up the steps
go out and tell your father you're sorry
get down off the bed and go out and tell Daddy you're sorry
and he did
and he said it very nicely
and this morning speaking of politeness and all that
he climbed up on the chair and asked me for something
very nicely
and now I'm telling him to stop whining
I don't want you whining
uhhuh
for example I'm going downstairs
okay
don't whine
yeah
basically if you agree to do what he wants
uhhuh
uh something nice
and you tell him stops whining
he'll stop whining
he'll stop
if you don't tell him to stop whining he'll continue
yeah yeah
you've gotta be very explicit in what you say
okay
I was fooling with his nose and he said
oh
he doesn't want no more help daddy
I got that coming up
he wanted me to get his stick
he was outside and he wanted to come in
he says
and we were watching tv oh here's Marky
that was the cat
that's not Marky
okay what will Mark talk about
we saw the Gonk and the Glimore something on tv
these are some Wug type nonsense creatures nonsense muppets
lived on some silly planet
and about two hours later he asked me
he really wanted the Gonk
what's going on
that's Marky in the background
he's going
dadadada
where's the ball
what happened to the ball
I thought that was rather nice
he just learned the word Seth
and did it rather nicely in a little sentence
not to roady
what are you doing
and this was a lie
because he had run out to try to find me
because he thought I was driving away
and I got out there and caught him in the act of looking for me
and also being out in the front yard where he's not supposed to be
so he said
I think he was really lying basically
he wasn't doing pee+pee on the grass
no no he tried
go ahead and do it
he couldn't do it
because he didn't want to in the first place
he didn't want to do pee+pee
he calls his bottle Flintstones
means I don't want my bottle
may I say that last week it was Barney
yeah he calls it Barney
and calls it bottle and now it's Flintstones
he's got lots_of names for it
he's changing around a lot
yeah he has names for his bottle
yeah
um he was looking for spoons or pencils I guess
as_if I want another also or I want another one too
I wasn't sure
I want one too I'm not sure
he might be confusing those
yeah that's what I was thinking
he's very into numbers
two and two right
I heard that sort of confusion before
I want two xxx
I want it too
where's the other one
oh here it is
what was that Mary
what you found
okay something
I'm going to take off your pants
so it looked like he was building it up out_of the units
don't take off
and then what
don't take off my pants
and then he kind of readjusted because he like it better with the idea that off would follow pants
so don't take my pants off
he likes that better
so he kind of correct himself essentially to that
and I was cleaning his nose a lot this morning and trying to fix him up
he was having a_lot_of problems
giving him medicine
giving him medicine right
and he really was getting unhappy
we told me we were trying to help him
trying to help him
try to help him feel better
but that was later
yeah I know later he said
he wanted Mark to come downstairs with him
as a command that's a command Mark coming downstairs
here he comes
here comes Ross whining up the stairs
he's sick that's his problem today
was that from Marky a bear sort of
I take away fra Marky
I take away fr Marky a bear
I take away fr Marky a bear
and it was from Marky
very carefully
and he did was he being mean about it
no
instead of saying you go to sleep like he usually says
also he smokes about anything now as a pipe
he smokes a pencil and what did he smoke this morning a teaspoon
yeah
okay
three times very insistently
it's sort of like he got pleasure out_of saying it three times
did Kitty go office Ross
where did Kitty go
is that what she did
Kitty go bye bye
what did she do
where'd she go
yeah where did she go
she went away
okay
and then we were taking a walk
did we take a walk
Daddy take a walk with Ross
okay
and

okay
and we I was pushing Marky
do you want to take a walk
okay
he meant no don't get going don't start pushing Marky
okay are you pushing Marky
in the little baby buggy
okay
do you want to take a walk
okay
no not yet not yet
no walk now
we are going to do this first
help me
good Ross
that was when we were fighting pushing the buggy
and then he pick up his put his brought his chair in from the kitchen into the dining room
he meant that my chair
where's your fall
your falls gone
he might have meant that my fault I doubt it though
okay let me try this little piece of paper okay
see what's on the back of this
oh and then I put out some new sponges
it's a nice fresh sponge
nice fresh sponge
you want to talk in there
and he imitated it nice fresh sponge
and what he meant was let's go inside
so he confuses outside inside
you think so
uhhuh

uhhuh
we were down moving some furniture down at the department and there was a table and I moved it away while Ross didn't see
gone

in his crib he always gets down

and did the monkey fall
he threw a monkey out_of his crib

I know where they were where they were
they were in order
they were in order in the pad
yeah xxx
uh you had written something so I just continued

you are uppie
cause I had already put him I had lifted him out_of the bed and I was holding him
I had taken him he had said
I pulled him out_of the bed and I was holding him
he said
you are uppie
so I put him down
could get up into his chair
heavy means hard but also means heavy
I don't know if he was referring to himself as being too heavy or what
and he was
Ross is sick
Daddy's sick

why not
why not
you might hurt Mark
right
the interesting part of this discussion was Ross said
