he tripped over some toys that were on the stairs and now he's falling
never play with electric sockets and plugs

what do you think it is
what's a blue liquid

do you know what his floaty says
it says floatosaurus
I think something was wrong with pipes and there's too much water in the kitchen
what's the cat doing
it is sitting on top of the freezer
I think a pipe broke and probably
the
a lotta water came outta the pipe and the kitchen is flooded
this is called a flood
when
when water
yeah
well he's not paying attention to what he's doing
he's lighting the candles on his birthday cake
and he throws them off on the side
he doesn't realize that he's putting all his presents on fire
that's not good
that's dangerous
what's this dinosaur doing now
what is that
is that a phone
it is
it's a phone on the wall
like that phone
there's a phone on that wall
floating in a floaty and dialing for help
probly dialing
y'know what
I bet she's dialing the fire department
cause if there's a flood
the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood
this is a flood when water goes where it's not supposed to go and there's a lot of it
that's called a flood
that's just what it's called
look the milk is floating
there's the dinosaur's tail
looks like she was cooking some peas
cause the pan of peas is floating in the flood
let's see what else we have here
a hot stove or heater can burn you
don't touch either one
don't bang on glass doors or windows
oh look she banged on it and it broke
don't tell strangers who phone that you're home alone
just say hello and ask them to leave a message
well you're not gonna be home alone Sweetie
you don't even have_to worry about that
dino phone
never play with things stored under sinks or in medicine cabinets
they can make you very sick
oh
never play with things under sinks or in medicine cabinets
cause they're not toys and they're not to be eaten at all
they make you really sick
they make you throw up
cause
they're bad for you
it's not for toddlers
or dinosaurs
it's just a rule that's why
it's just a rule because it's a rule
oh she's getting burned
she's touching the stove
if an adult isn't home don't let strangers into the house
tell them to come back later
mm
always put tools back where they belong
oh yeah if you trip on tools
sometimes tools are sharp
it can really hurt
I don't know
don't climb on thin branches
thin branches can break
cause they're thin
during a thunderstorm stay out of water and away from trees
lightning often strikes in both places
she's in her kiddie pool

Spinosaurus
during meals chew well before swallowing

pay attention when using a sharp knife
well
that dinosaur was talking to another dinosaur
while he was using a knife to slice this orange
but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also
oh no
by accident
cause he wasn't paying attention
cause he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else
if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that
you have_to look at the knife and be very careful with what you're doing
don't gulp hot foods
taste them slowly
you know about that
that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because he ate something that was too hot
I don't mean hot and spicy I mean hot temperaturewise

oh there's Mr and Mrs Mallard they're looking for a place to live
I think maybe they're gonna have some chicks
so they need to have a nice nest to live in
so they're trying to figure out where's a good place to build our nest
well you wouldn't wanna build a nest in a bad place
you wouldn't wanna build a nest in someone's bath room
you wouldn't wanna build a nest right on a street would you
because it wouldn't be safe
let see what happens to them
when they go to Boston xxx oh boy
hm
well what else would be a bad place to build a nest
let's ask let see if bird children know the answer to that question
well I wouldn't wanna build a nest right near some foxes
and I wouldn't wanna live in a nest where there wasn't any food near by
and I wouldn't wanna build a nest next to a play ground where there're lots_of noisy children all the time
I wouldn't build a nest in a refrigerator
it will be to cold
xxx just speaking bird language
because that's what birds really speak
ha ha ha ha xxx
I wouldn't wanna build to build a nest near a camera
why Naima
why
oh I wouldn't wanna build a nest right next to a bear
that would be scary
I wouldn't wanna build a nest on an airplane
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a cat
I definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a dog yikes yikes yikes
that's right dogs barking is loud and the birds might get annoyed by the dogs barking
that would be an a noisy annoying noise for the birds wouldn't it
near a duck
why not
duck is just another bird
may be it'll be okay to build a nest near a duck
should we read the rest of the story
hey that's the same did you hear the noise out there
is the same noise that Carmen makes that must of been a cardinal
I think Carmen is do you hear that
I think they're talking to each other cardinal must be Carmen must be talking to the other cardinal that are outside

and here they see the swan boats
see the swan

their children
because the bicycle the person on the bicycle didn't realize that there were ducks in the way
here're the ducks they're growing up and getting bigger now they're kinda like toddler ducks
oh the mommy still takes care of them
she's teaching them how to swim and dive
that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water
here they're they're lining up
she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels
that's kind of like when I tell you have be careful in the parking lot
and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you
that's just what Mommy taught you Naima
