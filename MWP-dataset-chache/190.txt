my foot
I see what this is all about
The_great_cat_chase
lemme see
hm
ahhah isn't that a riot
no
I'd say that's a little girl
and she looks like she's dressed up in her some of her mother's clothes or something
she's got on high heels and a pocket book
does that look like somebody I know
who get likes to get dressed up
I cann't imagine
somebody named Ursula Ann
she's giving her kitty cat a little ride in the carriage huh
oh oh
look what happened
she's bending over to pick a very pretty flower and the cat doesn't like the ride
cats don't usually like to ride too well so he's trying to run out_of the carriage when she's not looking
she turns around and she goes
oh no
she sees the blanket on the ground and the cat's gone
course he knows where she is he's peeking at her from behind the tree
she runs off to get a policeman because she cann't find her cat
she's really kind of worried
and she finds a policeman
and
there's a little body she oh
I don't know she probably says
oh dear oh dear my cat has run away and I cann't find him
the policeman puts up his hand
see he's saying
stop
oop
they turn around and there's the cat sitting right there looking at them
they probably feel kinda foolish now cause they thought he was missing and he wasn't at all
so they say
here kitty kitty kitty
kitty kitty
cat doesn't want to be caught you know
they don't like to be
he's looking at them as_if to say
well you catch me if you can
and there
whoop
the policeman tries to reach him and he cann't
he falls over
the little boy's laughing
and the little girl's very angry
she's kinda disgusted with him that he cann't couldn't catch the cat
so they're still calling him and they're walking after the cat to try to catch him
an the cat's looking back at them
he's gonna go through this big pipe
and he's probably gonna hide on them
I would imagine
oh no
look at this
he crawled into there and he's gonna make all of them crawl through there to catch him
look at him
he's peeking in to see where they are
oh isn't that funny
look at the man
well it's really a boy dressed up
but he's gonna fall onto the end an there's water down there
they're not gonna like that too well
he falls in the water and he helps the little girl out
the cat in the meantime is watching
he's probably having a real ball watching them fall in
oh no look at that he fell right in the h in head first into the water
now
now there he goes back in the pipe again
oh they're so mad now
oh no that was clever
see the little boy
he was sitting at the other end waiting and he got the kitty when he came out
he lost him
there he is hopping on that little boy's head
oh they must be furious with that cat huh
now he's gonna climb the tree
now they're gonna have a great time getting him out_of the tree
he climbs up the tree
the kitty cat's hanging on by one limb grabs a hold of him
whoops there goes the branch
it's ready to crack
oh oh
there it goes snap
he's fallen down
you think that's funny
xxx the man
well the branch wasn't strong enough to hold him so he's gonna fall
thud right on the ground
well they're all kinda battered and bruised and they're tired of trying to find that cat
there he
look at him
he's walking along behind just as like nothing happened
proud as can be
no I think he's kinda tired out so they put him in the carriage I guess
I know he's awfully tired
look at him
he ca he's sitting down resting
and the little girl
I dunno what she's up to
oh she says
wait a minute
and she goes in the house and she comes out with some iced tea and cookies
oh
she figures they need a little refreshment after trying to catch that kitty cat huh
they all look rather happy don't they
I think you know what we oughta do
I think we oughta try an put this car back together again
the way we found it
