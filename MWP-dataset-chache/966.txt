and they played all day in the grass and in the hay
when the sun went down in the great green field
the big cow lowed
the little pig squealed
the horses stomped in the sweet warm hay and the little donkey gave one last bray
the hens were sleeping in their nests
even the roosters took a rest
the little black bats flew away out_of the barn at the end of the day
and there they were all night long
