why do you need to earn the two dollars
to pay off Daddy
right
is that right
you gave you paid off his whole debt
I gave him one dollar cause he said he done all the books
he had done
and I gave him the tw the other money because I wanted him to give that to you
oh but the only the dollar was part of your debt
only the dollar was your p your part and the rest of that money was just because I wanted somebody to give Daddy the money
you understand Ross
