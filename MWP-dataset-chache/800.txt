Wild_things
I sit down
Where_the_wild_things_are
that's Max that's right
the night what Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another
his mother called him wild thing
and Max said I'll eat you up
so he was sent to bed without eating anything
that very night in Max's room a forest grew
and grew
and grew until his ceilings hung with vines and the walls became a world all round
that's Max
yes
and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max
and he sailed off through the night and the day
it's a sailboat
a private sailboat for Max
and in and out_of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are
that's Max's tail
and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars
and gnashed their terrible teeth
and rolled their terrible eyes
and showed their terrible claws
until Max said
be still
and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once
and they were frightened
and called him the most wild thing of all
and made him king of all the wild things
and now cried Max
let the wild rumpus start
wild rumpus
that's Max
that's who's doing a wild rumpus
wild rumpusing
wild rumpusing
now stop Max said
and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper
and Max the king of all the wild things was lonely and wanted to be with someone who loved him best of all
then all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat
so he gave up being king
he gave up being king of where the wild things are
but the wild things cried
oh please don't go we'll eat you up we loved you so
and Max said no
and the wild things
what did they do
what did they do
no that's not
Max is over here in his boat
they roared
those are all the wild things
wait a minute
I haven't read this page yet
the wild things roared their terrible roars
and gnashed their terrible teeth
rolled their terrible eyes
and showed their terrible claws
but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
and sailed back over a year in and out_of weeks and through the day
and into the night in his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him
and it was still hot
now we put on Nathaniel's pjs

www
a nice lady says hello when we come in
she's a nurse

she may wear a white dress called a uniform
and white shoes
or she may wear a pretty colored dress

my friend the doctor sometimes wears a white coat
that's the heavy one
that's the scale to measure how heavy you are
the doctor thumps my chest and feels my tummy
sometimes it tickles
he measures to see how tall I am
and he weighs me to see how much I've gained

the thing is this book paints such a picture of doctors that no doctor lives up to it
my friends the doctor and nurse want me to run and play and have a good time
they like to hear about my pets and games and the friends I play with
the b the the book should be disseminated among doctors not among kids
they want me to stay well
so does my mother
she sees to it that I get plenty of sleep and good food to eat and plenty of fresh air
once in a while though I just don't feel good
I feel hot and sick all over
I don't even want to play
then my mother takes me to see my friend the doctor
when he wants to know how hot I am inside he places the thermometer into the opening my bowel movement comes out_of
oh my god
he looks down my throat with his flashlight
with his stethoscope he listens to my heart and breathing
he tells my mother what medicine to give me
who likes it
daddy likes it
yeah he was laughing wasn't he
daddy likes this
daddy thinks it's funny
daddy likes this book
see the little boy is getting all better
because he took his medicines
he just took the medicines his mummy gave him
he didn't ask for extra medicines either
no vitamins
