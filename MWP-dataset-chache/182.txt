there
why don't
do you wanna take it all the way apart and see if we can put it back together again
okay then

let's see
how do we figure this out
oh
think we can get this back together if we take it all apart
remember where the things was
look at all those things in there
I see
is that the motor
I guess it is
you have_to take this thing off
the hood
that's the trunk
I bet that's what that other screw went to
that red screw
that was out
remember
I know
but what is that called
member when you when we got a flat tire the other night
that's why that tire is in there so_that when you have a flat tire you can change to a new tire
oh
well
yeah
wanna take all the wheels off
I think you're turning it the wrong way
here
you gotta use the uh
what's this
yeah
I don't know
there
you already had it unscrewed
try that one
I don't know either
well we'll try
you wanna unscrew them
what if we cann't
I don't know
we just have_to do the best we can
I think we can figure it out
what did you see at the fire station today
did uh did they go out on a fire while you were there
oh were there firemen there
Andrea was afraid
ah
what else is there to take apart
do you think we'll ever get this back together
here could I use the screw+driver
ya think we'll ever get this back together
okay

it's just
well I don't know
it doesn't go through there

member
okay
now okay
so what did Andrea do when she got scared

was Josh at school today
oh he did
Ava
okay now what're we gonna do next

oh
you know what
we have_to screw this on to it
like that
you hafta put this in
see
and then it'll stay
now you screw this
yeah
okay now you do this side
I hope we didn't forget anything
now
now we hafta put another one in here like this
see
and then you need a what
a wheel
there
okay
now why did Josh put the milk on his hair
oh
I think it goes the other way
yeah
who's somebody
oh Ava
where's Ava from
I don't think this fits
let's see
maybe we need a bigger

that's right
oh two more
well one can go there
I don't know
we have_to see what we're left with
can I put this wheel on
oh
okay
that was the motor
so_that would go in the front of the car
that went in here but was there something else that went with it
no
I guess that just went right there
suppose that
you suppose there's something under here that we're supposed to do
oh I see now
that's where that other yellow thing goes
can you put it in there
you know what we've gotta do
we gotta stop this and s start on this one okay
maybe after we're all through with this we can go back to this okay
yeah
but we have_to finish and do something else honey
see this
we have_to look behind this and figure out what's in there okay
do you wanna look and see what's in there
first let's clean this up and put it back in the box
I think this goes over there
no

does that make fifteen
guy this is something that the kitty did that you did at this at the park
the kitty finds a tunnel
right
and look
he goes through the tunnel
and he climbs on top of the pipe
and the policeman goes climbing after him
but you know what's there
that's a pond
it's full of water
and if somebody climbs through this pipe after the kitty they're gonna fall into that pond
do you know that
and if you fall in that pond you can get soaking wet

he crawls
he climbs through the pipe
and he fell right in it
and he got very wet
and the lady says
my kitty's not in the water
my kitty's up the hill

they fell in the water
and they got soaking wet
and the lady says
look
my cat's going back through the tunnel
they're soaking wet right
they get through the tunnel
this is the other end of the tunnel
and the little boy grabs the kitty
and this woman is hollering at him for some reason
I don't understand that
and the kitty's grabbing on to the policeman's head
you know how
like this
that's probably what the policeman says
and then what happens
Guy
the cat goes up the tree
