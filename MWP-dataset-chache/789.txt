when you don't listen to me
Mommy thought she was funny Abe

climb under the table
you better hurry and come eat Abe
what
oh okay
did you tell Dad what you stepped in today

that's completely dry
I just stained these two hours ago
uhhuh
not winter autumn
uhhuh hey look at this picture
no humans
really
oh
they'll starve to death

what would happen then
why
could the doctor put them together
where
what
oh okay
huh
what
the gun
let's see
oh how come the grey guys are the good guys
because why
then I guess people wouldn't have_to eat
and they wouldn't eat then
how come
oh I like to eat
here you go
I thought you wanted them apart
oh I'm sorry
Abe what do you think would have happened if Mommy wouldn't have eaten anything when she was pregnant with you

I'm glad she ate
those hot dogs didn't ever tell me the buns were burning
yeah
I'm working on it
pretty soon
get up if you want to
uhhuh
uhhuh
I don't know
the top

we can't have a cat here
the Christmas after we move
do you think it would be nice to have a cat
we could have a cat and a dog if we live in the right place
who's gonna feed the cat and the dog
how about Abe
I don't agree with that
not in this case
I like dogs better
Karen has two dogs doesn't she
and no cats
what makes you think that a cat is a woman's best friend
what makes you think a dog is a man's best friend
how come
what would you name a cat
oh
sure where are they
let's go look
oh too bad
I wonder who did that
how do you know
how do you know it was hers
Abe just because his print's out there doesn't mean that he did it
where are you going buddy
Abe time to come in

yeah
uhhuh
not yours
uhhuh
because I stuffed it with meat
I didn't take them apart
I just cut the top off and took the insides out
I'll show you
well now you know

uhhuh
I'm just squeezing it
I didn't did I
doesn't Abe think of some good science fiction stories

wounds
I don't know
yeah
I haven't ever seen a guy who looked like that

yeah so you better drink more milk Mom
I drink enough
what is it
wow
what about wizards
oh did Barb tell you that
you might start going on field trips to museums and stuff
where your class goes out and goes to museums zoos and stuff
so instead of always being in your classrooms sometimes you'll get to go out and do new things
uhhuh
yeah
uhhuh
where did you see those
uhhuh with the tops
oh
I'll get it when I'm through eating
or at the end of next week which ever comes first

I love you
what did you do this afternoon Abe
okay hey what would you have done if you wouldn't have gone to school

that's just a summer event
Abe did Steven's mom get pregnant
is Steven's mother pregnant
ask him okay
and if she is ask him when the baby's due
I didn't say doodoo
that's enough
sit up and eat
you're letting your food get cold
Carol's going to let us use all of Emily's things
isn't that nice
uhhuh
who does
does her grandmother have a dog
Keith said he's going to send you a picture of Trouble
that's Rufus's puppy
I guess Rufus got in trouble
so they named the puppy after her Abe
don't do that
it has several different meanings www
in February
look out
corn chowder
I'm not hungry
okay I will I was just teasing
uhhuh
here
don't you like buns
I made those biscuits for you Abe
they taste the same if they're bigger
no
we're eating early
they're not even on
after a while
Abe do you want to go to Bridgeman's later
what did you do today since it was raining and yucky all day
what did you do today since it was raining and yucky all day
how did you do that
it's not brandnew
where'd you get that
wow
well what would you have done if you wouldn't have gone to the store and to the garage sale
how come
oh think of all the stuff you did at home today
yeah
oh
you weren't bored by your homework
what
how come
you would have been happy doing your homework today if you wouldn't have gone to the store
yeah
what a number things
oh you can show Daddy those after dinner okay
oh boy
wow I'll do this one all by myself
okay
uhhuh you really have a bad cold
yeah
uhhuh
yeah but sometimes they sneak up on sheep and attack them
yeah a fox couldn't attack a sheep
but a coyote could
that's right
not necessarily
what
what's a male dog
not even a real dog
because it could fight back
huh
yeah
uhhuh
you're right
yeah I thought you were going to cough your head off
no that was just a figure of speech
it would be funny if you did cough your head off
because then your head would roll around
yeah
uhhuh
anything's possible
but was it really that small
what do you think about going to Texas for Christmas Abe
maybe we will
who killed the old grey goose
how did they find it
not in a whirlpool it was just upside down
I don't understand what's happening
somebody tell me what's happening
Abe tell me the story
you can tell me
go ahead
where was it
how did it get there
that's what I don't know
what
yeah then how did it drown if it could swim
that's not important
how did it drown if it could swim
was it dead
it's cold enough
right one m_and_m and one real one
what are you doing in there partner
okay did you eat both your vitamins
okay did you eat both your vitamins
I'm not going to
are you about done
no I won't peek
you have that yogurt dressing remember
you have that yogurt dressing remember
you don't want any
French
yeah
good
you got quite a bit on the table even
what
well how did it get on the table if you put it straight in
oh I'll use some of Abe's
hm
I have a bowl
where
you want a celebration
so you and Daddy are going to have a party while I'm at the hospital having the baby
while I'm having the baby
oh
here it is
you sure are
yeah
when
when she was first born
that's the umbilical cord after they cut it
that's right
that's medicine to prevent infection
no the umbilical cord's soft
you know when you get a cut and you get a scab on it
after the blood dries up it gets hard
that's what the umbilical cord does too
it's soft
but after it gets cut it dries up and gets hard
so the medicine isn't hard
it's the cord that's hard
what
remember the book we looked at the other day
how big do you think the baby is then
these days or when it was first growing
oh pretty big each day
as fat as Amy is now or as fat as she was when she was pregnant
Abe
I don't think you could have since it spilled
I hope to someday
uhhuh
not a medical doctor though
would you like to be a medical doctor
why not
yep would you like me to
I have_to go over there tonight and check out
uhhuh
why thanks Mom
I didn't give them to you
no I'm not
those are mine
I'm gonna need them when I take the course again
yeah I thought I'd be through with them by summer
so you could use them then
but my plans didn't work out
so you'll have_to wait an extra year
no I was gonna give them to you this summer
but now you'll have_to wait until next summer
I'm gonna need them next year
I was using it to get some of your dressing
are you going to be a paperboy someday Abe
what
oh
you should probably be a little older than five
you'll probably have_to be older then five to be a newspaper boy
you did
you did what
what did you carve
what's the head
oh the top and the stem
oh
it doesn't have any seeds left in it either does it
oh
uhhuh
Abe what would you have done if the pumpkin had said ouch when you were carving it
what would you have done then
why would you get out_of there
what's that
what
I'd have been surprised
oh that's pretty good advice
yes
how did it get stuck
oh
we can throw it out if you don't want it
they're over Abe
you can turn it on and see I guess
did you tell Daddy who came to visit today that we haven't seen in a long long time
