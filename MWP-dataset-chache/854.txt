okay
anyway
all the animals get on the
boat

but he says
come along with me
and he puts them in a fish+bowl and he takes them on the ark
well that just seems silly
yeah
Squawky_the_parrot says
hurry up
it looks like rain
so he goes and he's in the snow

so they go into the forest to look for bees and bears
so Noah climbs the tallest tree
and he sees two bears eating some honey
where there's honey there are bees
so he finds two bees and they buzz and come along with the bears
so now we have bees
and bears

zebras and tigers and lions and
all these other animals
elephants
and a hippopotamus
can you say hippopotamus
and they stop and talk to the lion
king of the jungle
and Noah says

so the lions and the tigers and the bears and the camels and the zebras and the hippos
and the bees and the bears
and the goats and the bats and the penguins and the octopi
all line up and climb back into the ark and Squawky says
hurry up
it looks like rain
