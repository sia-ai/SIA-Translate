where do the grandma and grandpas live
New York
it's New York City
first they get washed there are ninety two men and thirteen women
many take showers and a few take baths
two men and three women run bubble+baths
and one man reads in the tub while a cat watches
one woman sits in the bubbles and sings
they're all getting clean right
he's taking a shower
scrubbing his feet
she's taking a shower
he's washing his hair
she's taking a bubble+bath and singing
she has pink fuzzy slippers huh
yeah
she likes to go to bed with her pink fuzzy slippers
yeah
what do you think he dropped on the floor
the soap I think
right
when they have finished washing they dry
they use big towels and little towels and a lot of dusting powder
all the men shave except for three who have beards
two of them trim
then
then see what's he doing
right
then when the one hundred and five people are showered and bathed shaved and toweled dusted and dried they put on their underwear
huh
mhm
yes he has a beard so he's not shaving he's got quite a scraggly beard doesn't he
yeah
right
you're right
and men wear under shorts or briefs
yeah he does look like he needs a trim doesn't he
they are giving them to themselves trims right
yeah
he looks like he could use a little trim
but
I guess he likes his hair long like that
yeah some of the men wear teeshirt undershirts with sleeves and some with undershirts without sleeves
and a few of the ninety two do not wear undershirts at all
the night and the temperature are falling and one thin man buttons up a suit of long sleeve long legged underwear
all of the men put on black socks
there are short socks and long socks and fancy silk socks and that have decorations called clocks
I think that's what that is
some of the men wear leg garters to keep their long socks from falling down around their ankles
hm
the man with the long beard has a whole in his sock I think
yeah
the thirteen women put on different kinds of complicated underwear
underpants panty+hose stockings petticoats slips and bras
one woman who's feet always freeze puts on wool socks over her stockings
mhm
she's wearing a slip which is kind of like a skirt but it goes under your skirt
uhuh

she's putting her underpants on
no
when all the men have their underwear on they get into long sleeved white shirts and button them up
then they put on black trousers
forty five men stand up to get into their pants
forty seven sit down to put their pants on
each pair of pants has a shiny black stripe down the outside of each leg
the men zip zippers and button a button or two
one man has wavy black hair streaked with white like lightning
he puts on a very soft white shirt with ruffles down the front
it has special cuffs that fasten with cuff+links
this man hooks a wide black cloth belt around his waist
the belt is called a cummerbund
like a xxx

none of the other men wear belts with their pants they button suspenders onto the waist lines of their pants and snap the suspenders over their shoulders
snap
snap
eight women dress in long black skirts
they wear black tops sweaters or blouses
four women put on a long four women put on long black dresses and one wears a black jumper over a black shirt
a few of the women put jewelry on a necklace earrings but no bracelets
bracelets would get in the way when they're working
hm
yes indeedie
what is she playing
mm it's a bigger one though so I think it's probably a cello or a bass
yeah I think you're right
all the men put on black bow+ties some tie them on in front of mirrors and some stare into space and tie them
the thin man whistles a tune as he ties his tie
twenty seven men have clip+on ties that are already made into bows the man with the wavy black and white hair the ruffly shirt and the cummerbund ties on a very big white bow+tie
it looks like a white bat
no one else has a tie like this he slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that is short in the front and long in the back where it divides in two like black beetle wings
right
the jacket and pants are called tails
really
really

the man slips on a white vest and then a black jacket that has a shortened front oh yes that black beetle wings
the jacket and pants are called tails
tonight all the other ninety men put on tuxedo jackets
these are black too with shiny satin lapels
those are the lapels
but they do not have that beetle wing back
when all the men and women are completely dressed in black and white they get ready to go out
they put on overcoats jackets or caps boots or rubbers mitten or gloves

right
almost everyone picks up a case the cases are different shapes and shades of black and brown
the man with the dark wavy hair with the white lightening in it the ruffly shirt the cummerbund and the bow+tie that looks like a white bat picks up a very thin briefcase
no one else has a case like this
whada you think they have in all these big cases
I think they have musical instruments

and a flute
and a bass
and a french+horn
that's a good question maybe um trumpet
yeah maybe it is
oh that's that's definitely a bass because it's so big it's on wheels maybe that's a bass and that's a cello maybe

that's xxx
yeah
oh because you're

gray's nice
and they walk out of one hundred and five doors into one hundred and five streets
and there they take taxi cabs cars subways or busses to the middle of the city
I still don't see her we'll have_to keep looking
alrightie then
the man with the black and white wavy hair wears a black coat with a velvet color and a white silk scarf
he steps into a very long car that is waiting for him outside his apartment building
while the driver drives the man opens his case and looks at some papers
he sings a little and he hums

one hundred and one of the men are women are carrying the musical instruments that were in those cases

everyone turns to the first page of music it is a white page covered with black lines and musical notes
the man with the black wavy hair lit with white enters the room
he walks to the front of the stage and steps one step up onto a box called a
podium
there he can be seen very clearly by the one hundred and four people on the stage and by the hundreds of people in the audience
the audience applauds
the man bows
he is the conductor the leader of the orchestra and he holds a stick in his hand
it's called a baton which is French for stick
who's from France

fills with music

should we read
should we read your prehistoric animals
alrighty
the prehistoric animals included in this book are just a few of the strange and interesting creatures that once roamed our planet
huh what's that
a woolly mammoth
wow
sure
woolly mammoths were a type of prehistoric elephant the woolly mammoth which was distinguished by its long shaggy hair was almost thirteen feet tall
and appeared about two million years ago during the Ice_Age of the Pleistocene epoch
right what was the one that we saw at the Pequot museum remember we saw one
oh the mastodon
right
looks similar
right
during the Ice_Age massive ice sheets called glaciers covered vast areas of land
because it had a thick layer of fat under its skin as well as abundant hair the woolly mammoth managed to keep warm in the year round winter xxx
crash
yeah I think so
the mammoth lost relatively little body heat through it's ears
boom
it's ears were very small
it's long curved tusks enabled it to find food by clearing away snow and ice
woolly mammoths have been found preserved in the frozen tundra of Siberia
prehistoric man who probably hunted them for food decorated caves with drawings of these magnificent animals
wow
very long
huh who's this
the saber+tooth tigers first appeared sometime between twenty six and thirty six million years ago
oh my gosh his tusks are going in his mouth
wow
there we go
the scientific name for the saber tooth tiger is makeri Machairodont Machairodont Machairodont
does that sound better
you think Machairodont
this group included many different kinds of cats all of which had long fangs in their upper jaws
