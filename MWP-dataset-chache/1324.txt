look how this makes everything turn
one makes the others turn
watch
if I turn this
see how easy they go around
yeah we'll get it later
there's that tape machine it'll get it
it's probably Mommy wondering where uncle Craig is
do you know what this is for
this is like radar
it finds out where the planes are
like if there's a plane out here in the sky
there's a plane out here and this thing goes around and gets little signals off the plane and the planes going
they have those lights that flash
okay
that's not only so you can see them some of it are signals that they're sending out so the planes everybody knows where that plane is
you see
this guy is down it the tower
you see this guy right here
he's the air traffic controller
he's down in the tower there
he says hey he's got a little screen and he looks at it and sees these dots and these lines and stuff and he says hey there's a plane out there
we'll tell him when he can land
we'll tell him no don't land yet don't land yet
time to land now
why couldn't he land maybe
maybe because what would be a reason why he couldn't land yet
oh
no let it turn
Because it will turn with it
see they're all connected with each_other
watch if I turn this one
it'll make the other ones turn
yeah
see push it down a little bit see

watch them
here they go
are they slip+ons or slip_offs
I know what
when I put them on they're slip+ons
and when I take them off
that's it
just put them right there
come on by
where are they going
oh I get it that's like a car wash
it is a car wash
yeah it's an airport but it does look just like a car wash
it does look like a car wash
see this is the sprayer
watch we'll put it there and go pshshsht
it sprays the car all wet
pshshsht
how do you get it over in where
it only goes up to there doesn't it
it doesn't go back in
I don't know why
maybe we'll pretend there's a little thing right there that shoots it out
pshshsht
so it shoots it back the other way
er
how come those guys don't get wet when they go through the car wash
or do they
but they're just out there wauy out in the open
like this
if we went in uncle Craig's car through the car wash
you know his convertable
and we put the top down
then we'd be out in the open and we'd get all wet and so would the inside of the car
want to do that
go through with the top down
n a a a a haha
they say spray soap on us
we'd go through and they'd go pshshsht
they you know what they'd do
then they'd spray water at us
pshshsht
it'd be like taking a shower in the car
yeah
we could do that in uncle Craig's car
I don't think we better
cause it would get our clothes all wet and also it would get the inside of uncle Craig's car all wet too
even your car seat
we could take our car and open up the sun roof
then we'd get everything all wet inside
oh yeah
then we'd be out in the open
then they'd spray soap onus and get us all wet
wet clothes
boop zoop
pee
what are you saying pee for
oh I don't want to squirt them with pee
who are we going to squirt with pee
the car wash
you spray me I'll spray you
huh
tippydodo
well alright maybe we shouldn't do that then
huh
maybe we shouldn't go through the car wash and get soap all over us
not if you want to go pee on everybody
nah haha
but that's what it looks like those guys are doing
they're going through
these guys
they were sitting in a convertable
see that's a convertable
it doesn't have a top
it doesn't have a top
