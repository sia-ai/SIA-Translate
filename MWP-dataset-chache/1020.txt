I'm sorry stop eating
put your feet put your feet down
dad
it's dinnertime
you just reminded me
oh my God
you mixed it up child
you got it confused
at dinnertime your feet are on the floor
will you rub your hands off please too Jink
you use your hands as much as I do
probably more effectively too
now I believe that tonight that its Jen's turn to do the dishes
unhunh
yes because Dana did them last
that's one thing I'm not doing
one among many
yes wait till there
you can't sock me because you have nothing to threaten me with
you're going to do them child that's just all there is to it
Dana is going to dry
Dana please eat it on the table
take me a while to get me to do it
it won't take anything at all
unhunh
you want to make a bet
xxx lose either way
if I win you lose but you win you lose too
unhunh
you're don't making it sound so comforting
what does she lose if she wins
we'll let we'll let it be a vague threat or vague encouragement
rats I'll just call the F_B_I
I'll take care of them
dad your you tease too much
did you tell them that you say xxx Jinky
anybody
yeah I told J_J
what did he say
he didn't say anything
he didn't hear it
I saw in the sports pages tonight that Reggie is on a streak
well
he has hit in the last four games
he hit two doubles in Minnesota
two doubles Jinky
I didn't realize he had two doubles in Minnesota
that would be yesterday
did they win in Minnesota
they said his overall average for having done so badly even with the first ten even twenty games or eighteen games his overall average for the second part is now two hundred seventy
it's better than one hundred ninety eight
well no his combined average is now about two twenty
the first half it was one ninety eight
yes that's right
isn't that awful
yes
especially since Winfield didn't xxx
Winfield's having trouble now
Winfield's has been going down
Dana you like Winfield
and you know who's going up
Reggie
Mumphrey
Mumphrey
Mumphrey was already high too
Mumphrey
where did they get Mumphrey from
he's the one who made two two wait let me say it two triples and a home run
I know
where did they get Mumphrey from Woody
they got him from the same team that Winfield came from
Houston Astros
oh no San_Diego Padres that's right
well I know that's where Winfield came from
yeah now the other thing is that a
what is
do you do they didn't trade him
boy they were stupid to xxx
he was a free agent too
oh he was a free agent
yeah
do you that Reggie picked up on Friday night out there in front of us over thirty one dollars and put it in his pocket
uhhuh
how did that get reported
in in tonight's paper
well we saw him do it
oh no and then he got something like twelve dollars the next night but on Sunday he had been getting so many hits he got a home run on Saturday he had been getting so many hits they only threw him one dollar
ninety
okay
why did they only throw him one dollar
ninety
he didn't need money any more
he's going to have his contract renewed
that's right
really
oh he's a free agent so he if he goes on the market somebody like the White_Sox who have a short left field fence will pay him a million dollars even
so even if he gets to the point when he can't play the outfield you saw the way he was running the bases there he loves to run bases and he's fast but he doesn't do any outfield as concentrate
who Reggie
I think he's a great outfielder
and that's it
and I think as a who was it Ralph_Boston said quite correctly that's part of his part of a sign of probably being a fairly savvy guy a smart guy
it's really boring in the outfield
it's hard to concentrate during the season
that's what I hear
I stink in the outfield
I like first base better
I like Spencer he's first base isn't he
no Spencer was traded
Watson's first base
Spencer who
Jim Spencer was traded away
Jennifer will you eat that over your plate
who who was he traded to
I'm not certain Detroit maybe just not certain
I think xxx
the tigers are doing okay this year
the tigers are good this year
why is it that nobody likes my vegetables
look over there to your left
we didn't even realize they were there
would you have eaten any
yeah
we never like vegetables
we don't like your kind of vegetables
I like your tomatoes
yeah your tomatoes are good
want another tomato each
yeah
yeah
I want that one

yes mother dear
but no sleeping over that I changed my mind
Rebecca too
yes
Dana lifted off and you saw what happened right
oh yeah
I didn't want her to sleep over so it really doesn't matter
that's right
if it did matter she would have put pressure on me and I would have backed down
really
probably I can't really hold out very well
you hold out good to me
okay
I really don't think xxx but on some things I hold out very well
I can be very firm
Rebecca canceled on them why can't xxx

yeah
must be plugged in
oh it sure is Jinky
I really think you should start washing it about every four or five days
I told I told her because_of itch

because it was itching I thought she should wash I told her to wash it twice this time and she then she should wash it again in two or three days
I'll wash it tomorrow morning

you don't need to do that
yes I do because it its it's still itching
but will need to wash it again in a couple of days
I really know her mom
are you ready

it's charming mother
now turn your head sideways Jenny
now get your hands out_of your hair
xxx scratch me
okay Jenny have you got your xxx
that's where you touch the brush pretty hard
in the xxx
xxx put yours away use your comb
like that

could I just
no no no
touch the brush
no you can't
I have_to finish there's a long job in front of me here
it feels so good
it looks so good
today is Tuesday right

it wrinkles up your face
ouch
xxx my face will wrinkle quickly
dad xxx I'm sorry
we got we got a bad place
we got a bad place now
everybody's worried about getting their period
I don't give a shit
I mean I don't give well
dad please be careful
okay okay
we have a real knot in the hair here
now I'm going to pull apart again
so you kind of hold it up there and help me out okay
good we're really this now
you kind of hold
will you show me the rat
well it's only half a rat now
there are two half rats
hey just take it out
well you can't just take it out
you have_to comb it out
ouch
okay
take bit by bit
look at this small bit that I'm taking
that's it
well take a little bit of it
well we got this part
now what you need to do Jinky is to hold your head back toward me a little bit
and turn to the side more
turn this way more
that's it
and back this way
I want you right up there
I want you good
the problem is there is another problem with this you know doing your hair and that is as we
hey oh no ever find me you scratch it undoes it Jinky
which will Jinky no
I can't help it
dad you going to have_to tie my hands to stop me from itching
how about tying you to the chair
I know xxx the padlock to my bicycle
go get it
no we're okay
itch itch on the other side for now
but the other side doesn't hurt for when xxx xxx my hair on this side
okay we're getting it
no we aren't
yeah we are
well most of it isn't bad
remember the first bit I did had nothing bad in it
I don't believe that dad
you may say that but it doesn't feel it
well now we're getting a_lot_of electricity is what we're getting now in the hair and that makes it more complicated
I want you to keep your head to the side so I will keep it to the front
I've already done part
that's very important okay
I like the way mom does it
she holds it while she
okay I am holding too
xxx that hurts
well this is very very messy hair
that's why it hurts
no it isn't
it's because you're brushing it too hard
that's why it hurts
she said that with fervor right
honey what if I put the brass candle+sticks on the piano
that'll be alright
you might as_well give up and just braid it up
no we've got_to do now it we're ever going to get it done
actually I have a fair amount of it kind of done Jenny
maybe the first fifth of it done
look at this
look at this
the whole brush full of hair we can actually go through now
now let's try to take this
go underneath
that feels sort of good too
go up near
yeah what you like is that
Jink take this part in front
just hold it there for a second
don't do anything else with it yeah
see it it's possible that I can kind of tease most of these small rats just by brushing very lightly through the hair and then doing the same thing underneath
well should I try that
underneath it isn't going to be the best
underneath it really isn't the matter
yeah it does
it's not as much as outside as outside
that's true
go check out the lamps when you're finished Jink
xxx is cutting my hair
where
no no no
I can do it
that's not the question
I don't want her hair cut
stand up and turn around Jinky and let daddy see
it really needs to be cut with this
well I think it has two feet to go before it needs to be cut
look
my thought was
turn your head back Jink
that we shape it so_that it Woody look so it was all even in about right here
that's okay
add two more inches
add two more inches
no she's already said that that's what she wants
add two more inches
you mean up higher
no lower
subtract two more inches
I need a comb
that is what I need
I shall be back
it's just the same as what the beautician did last time
I can do it as_well_as she can
yeah it's true
I had that much done with me
your hair is longer than mine at this point
right now I had last year on my birthday I had my hair cut
I think she was carrying too much hair
when added to her weighty years it burdened her
okay no faces
Jennifer turn your head down
you know who I thought looked really cute of the babies we saw
out_of Lucas and Michael and Matthew
do you remember which one out_of those three I thought was really cute
which one
guess
Lucas
Lucas
Michael I mean Matthew
you both think the others were Matthew and Lucas
you're both wrong
I thought Michael Michael_John was so cute
yes he is cute
okay hands off Jen
hands off
when you're done you're going to that for an hour
no I'm not
I just trimming it
it kind of
big cheering crowd here

Jinky I need you to turn all the way around and turn the chair around
Jinky get up off the chair

oh over here
okay we'll start from here up front
turn all the way around this way
that's it
start from the front
keep your hand off her hair Dana
I'm sorry I'm sorry I worked very hard to do this
I wasn't going to ruin it
but you can't tell
this side isn't xxx and it's
oh it's horribly worse
really
no it's not
we'll be done within five minutes
Jinky turn your head this way
come on now I need cooperation
this is the tricky part right up in here
just a minute
move move your chair up towards Jinky's
can I get up

not too much
be careful there okay dad
I can see it
there's there's some rats here
be careful
okay
okay
now move this over
we're okay
I don't know if I feel okay
see if it works I should be able to run my fingers through too
get a comb instead of your fingers
no
just put your
Jennifer you must stop scratching when I
xxx in my hair and don't feel that all that dirt gunk
turn back this way now
I still have this difficult part to do
Jinky back farther even
that's it
see what I'm trying to do
rather than do it all at once just do it bit by bit
you know I can cut Dana's hair but it might be a disaster
what you're cutting or Dana's hair
dad
you're done
almost
I've just got_to make sure it's straight
I would say Jink we're moving right along here
oh my God dad look
let me see
stop for a second dad
no no please don't Jink keep your head turned
I don't want to lose it
just a few places
we just keep working on it here
ouch
don't use your fingers
oh that's the test
if I can get my fingers through it's pretty straight
I'm getting my fingers through pretty well now
a few hang+ups here
turn back
then you have_to bury that okay
I have a thesis chapter to read tonight
don't cut too much more mom
I'm not honey I'm just xxx it
okay
don't cut any more
just a bit
she has_to make even
see your hair has a twist in it kind of sticks out a little bit
it's hard to see to see xxx thing is
yeah it it really not a good idea to cut hair when it's clean
well and or unless it's very wet
okay turn around and let daddy see
that's good
that's good
is it short
no
it really looks a lot better
its about this far below your shoulders
Jennifer would you keep your head xxx
would you keep your head
what do you mean how was it before
it was straggly
it kind of hung down like those with xxx
oh I think that's terrific
I did a good job
yeah it makes her look very xxx girl
better than the beautician did
I think so
we didn't want the beauticians on our block
Jeannie wait I'll show you how you can see what I've done
come on
going to set up a double mirror
oh my god my hair is too short
it is not Dana
it is not
you look most of most of your life with shorter hair
actually it will grow out pretty quickly
can you see the back
it makes it look a lot thicker
yeah
okay Jennifer you're done
you have_to braid it now
but not a little
what's xxx
mom
oh golly it's nice
it looks xxx behind is it
keep your no no keep your hand out
keep your hand don't you do that
I'm just xxx
you do one thing better than me
I'm better at cry+babying
I'm better at my mouth
I'm better at being myself
I'm better at bullshit
that's true
if this French question isn't true then it's alright
certainly is
I'm trying to get all the way through all the hair
okay
turn around this way now
hey be careful
stand up
I found some underneath that wasn't done quite before

do we have a comb we can use for Jennifer xxx braid
xxx four inches about xxx
let me have the comb

you know how Ruth does it
or Maja
she cuts it about to there and wants it to curl
isn't that gross
it's alright
Maja doesn't mind
you know when you're about five or six years old or seven there are many more things you can do with hair than when you're thirteen
come on Dana
you know why Bill went off went off the little dive when he was three
because he didn't know the feel of it

that looks good
okay do it right down there
just at the bottom
now now look that messes it up
I will not do it Jink
keep your head
okay okay
if you don't want to do it don't do it
but if I want to tell you to do it I can tell you to do it
but you don't have_to do it
