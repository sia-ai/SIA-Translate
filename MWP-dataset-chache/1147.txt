what does mommy like to eat at the mall
coffee mommy likes to get coffee at the mall
and mommy likes those pretzels to doesn't she
you like donuts
this is like my dad use to say like when he takes out his slide shows from when he was like thirteen
and he takes out his old xxx for size
he goes oh look ah all those people
dead dead dead
oh she's dead
he should be dead if he's not
dead dead dead I'm like
it's like Lily dress dress dress dress dress next page
dress dress dress
exactly
boys should be wearing dresses too
dress dress dress
oo boy what's he cooking
what does that look like to you
hot dogs
yummy
so did I tell you Manuela
that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna
that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it
and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever
so she loves it
so um although not with mayonnaise
only eats tuna in olive oil
like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt
I know
oh she wearing a dress too
so I called I kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and I forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment
so I called one day and it's a big practice
and you know a bunch of doctors running around
told her I was a patient of Dr Louis I was wondering if you could ask
yes sweetie pie
okay sweetie mommy has Hondo and Fabian to if you wanna read it
oh
you wanna read that one
okay
oh I'm sorry angel
I'm sorry
did I just scratch your lil nose
can I kiss it
does that feel better
oh good
so I call up and I said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide+lines as to how much tuna a kid can eat
because she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna
so I've only been I've been trying to give it to her once a week
and she'll eat like a three ounce can
but even that I'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her because she wants it
wow
and um so I called and the woman's like okay I'll ask like you're crazy
she gets back on the phone she goes Dr Lang said one to two ounces a week like that's like two bites an ounce
I know
so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday
so this is what they're recommending for that an adult female shouldn't have like should have a can because a big a regular size can of tuna is six ounces
yeah
so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two
I know
I eat it too
I eat so much tuna
I know
I mean I think it's only related to pregnancy
and young kids but I guess the mercury will affect brain development
potentially
you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really I guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on
but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week I can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people
she would literally eat it everyday if she could
I know literally the small the tiny can with the flip
top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever
that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny
so they're saying this for adult pregnant woman
right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant
right
what would you like sweetie
you can climb under and get it
oh you're looking for something want me to move the camera
I can move it for you
I don't know what she's looking for actually

what does a goat say
ma
Max said be still
and tamed them with the magic trick
of steering into their yellow eyes without blinking once
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
and made him king of all the wild things
and now cried Max let the wild rumpus begin
their dancing by the light of the moon
and swinging from the trees
and marching in a parade
now stop Max said
and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper
and Max the king of all wild things was lonely
and wanted to be with someone who loved him best of all
then all around from far across the world he smelled good things to eat

but the wild things cried oh please don't go
we'll eat you up we love you so
and Max said
no
the wild things roared their terrible roars
and gnashed their terrible teeth
and rolled their terrible eyes
and showed their terrible claws
but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good bye
and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day
and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper was waiting for him
and it was still hot
