demolish means to destroy
to reek havoc
destruction
remember when we were in Myrtle_Beach
that's okay
you weren't supposed to know everything
you're only seven
you just try your best
that's all you can do
well it has a much thicker stem than that one does
I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it yet
I know what I can do with it
remember when we were out in California and Arizona
and we saw those cactuses
I'm gonna make it that
because they have real thick green stems remember
this isn't turning out very well
yes look it looks kind of obnoxious don't you think
it looks kind of strange doesn't it
well you have a point there
cactuses are kind of unique
here you can have it
I think I'm going to put some brown on my cactus because isn't there brown in cactuses
we never planted our cactus seeds
remember the cactus seeds we bought
at the airport
pardon
that's right
that's yours and dad's project
I know what the problem is
I was supposed to buy that mm
remember that special stuff at the florist
the special dirt
your hair is in your eyes
it's called leafmold or some kind of planting stuff that you start seeds in
I never
is this goofy or what
sometimes you see little flowers on cactus plants when they're in bloom
I don't think there's black in a rainbow is there
this is really tacky
there's sometimes a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
that's probably the best drawing you've had
this is like
I'm like not signing my name to this picture
it's really ugly
it's nice
here's what I'll do
look this is the person that did that picture
Fri you did a really nice picture
you're right I'll scratch it out
mom
fair enough
I'm trying to make a pizza
and I wanted to make like a nice round circle
but it's not that round looking is it
scratch it out and make another one
it would be awfully hard to make a pizza don't you think
how do you make a pizza
what would we do next if we were making a pizza
what color of sauce
pepperoni
does this look like a
let us let us do a Mineos pizza
okay what color is that
red
isn't like a brownish though
we'll make one of daddy's
you know when daddy makes a pizza
he puts the pepperoni on like isometrically
do you know what isometrical means
perfectly in order exactly in place
I don't know
you think
this pizza has a boatload of pepperoni on it
is that enough pepperoni
now how are we gonna make mushrooms
yes
hey that's a heck of a good idea Fri
that's really a good idea
the brown ones are mushrooms and the red ones are pepperoni
you know what else we gotta put on our pizza
yes
oh that's right cheese
cheese is mm how about if we use this yellow for the cheese
hi
