Mister Jeremy Fisher wants to catch fish for dinner
first he digs for worms
Mister Jeremy uses a lily pad for a boat
he casts his line in the water and hopes to catch
minnows
Jeremy begins to feel hungry
he reaches in his basket for his delicious
lunch
Jeremy dips his foot in the water
something tweaks the toe of one of his galoshes
a water beetle
Jeremy hears some noises in the nearby plant
he says
I wonder what that is
muskrats
Jeremy moves to another part of the pond
finally he gets a bite
he has caught a
stickleback fish
before long a trout swallows Jeremy
he doesn't like the taste so he spits out everything except for Jeremy's
galoshes
Mister Jeremy Fisher hops all the way home
once home who do you think should knock
Mister Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newt
Jeremy invites his friends inside
I didn't catch any minnows
he says
but I do have something
a tasty grasshopper
that will be fine
says Tortoise
we can still have a nice meal
I brought something too
