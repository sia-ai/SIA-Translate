they chase after the kitty and he seems to be going into a tunnel
and they go through the tunnel
and who's on the other side
they come out_of the tunnel

he runs up
this reminds me of
Rosies_Walk
they try to climb up and get him and what happens
they all fall down again
and their hats fall off
and now they're in a puddle
he runs back through that tunnel
and the girl goes back through the tunnel
and the policeman goes back through the tunnel
and look
somebody catch that kitty
this other kid

he jumped on his head
she's telling him what to do
this little girl is telling this little kid what to do
pointing her finger
then the kitty runs up a tree
and this child tries to get the kitty
everybody's watching and she looks kind of sad
this little girl
he's sticking out his tongue
the policeman catches the cat
and the cat starts to fall down
and the child falls down

hi
I'm Elise Masur

hi

I have a present for you
for today's visit

oh Victor
let's get your coat and then we'll play with those
that that's just for today's visit
we have another gift coming for
oh xxx
and somebody will be in shortly to try and arrange for it
oh okay
bye bye Victor
well maybe the other person took it
alright so let me put down my stuff
did you hear what Janet was telling you
huh
she was telling me
well there are three different things to do okay
there's a book to look at there's a Take_apart car and there's a uh store sort of like Josh has at his house
so do you know which one you would like to do first
the Take_apart car
let's take it down
ya wanna help
okay and bring it over here
right over here
who does
oh Jason Cantridge
well then you probably know how it works
let's take it out_of the box okay
okay do you know how it works
well those are tools
well let's see if we can figure it out okay
yeah they're two bolts
ho how do you take a bolt out
you don't know
you could use a screw+driver
that's gonna be hard to get it in there
see where the slot is
does the screw+driver fit in the slot
try turning the slot oh yeah
that's gonna need some help though
you know what
it needs the wrench to hold
no
you just turn this and I will hold the nut
you turn the bolt
okay okay is that loose enough to pull out with your fingers
okay alright ah now we've got the idea
you want to do the same one on the other side
okay
okay here all the pieces that you take out we'll put in a pile
does that loosen it
okay xxx okay what else would you do with that screw+driver
the flashlights
the headlights
the headlights
this is like being a mechanic
I wonder if these same toys will be here when we came back with Daddy
that comes off
that's the front fender front bumper okay
oh put it in the same pile
okay now what else can you unscrew with that screw+driver
that's the front headlights
yeah
I don't know but I'm sure that whatever it is it's not tools like this
probably not yet
okay now what else comes apart
now that you have taken that apart
okay
those are the hubcaps
they're screws
they're supposed to be the hubcaps on the car
it needs to be screwed more doesn't it
if you need the extra help
looks like you're doing okay yourself
okay let's see
use the screw+driver because that's what the screw+driver is supposed to do is to help you unscrew
let's see now
there
you unscrew while I hold the wheel there okay
hen when it's loose enough you can pull it out with your fingers
okay very good job
off comes the wheel
okay
that's one
we've still got how many left to do
do you know how many are left to do
three more
that's right
are you making that looser or tighter
you want to make it looser if you want to take it apart
oh no
it's not locked
it's just closed so_that people walking up and down the hall won't bother us
that's one more
okay who's going to take the tire off me or you
you
uh oh now I know why they call it a Take_apart car
that's one whole side of the car taken apart
here we've got one more side of the car to take apart
oh look what else just came off
the hood of the engine came off
now we can see what's wrong with the engine
do you want to see what's wrong with the engine
or you wanna keep taking apart the wheel
okay okay this is like a puzzle isn't it
what are you gonna do after we take it all apart
put it back together
that's gonna be a trick
okay what do ya think is going to come off now
hat wooden side huh
okay it's almost all apart
it's almost all apart
that's the engine
okay
uhhuh
can we be the mechanics
absolutely
hm
something in the trunk too
oh look what the trunk has in it
a spare tire
that's like in our car we have a spare tire in_case we get a flat tire
so_that has_to be taken apart too
mhm
you know how many there are
or do you have_to count them
mhm
okay alright let's see
there's some more bolts left in here
two more bolts
do you remember that the yellow bolts go on the sides
can you remember that
cause when we put it back together we are going to have_to remember which bolts go where
oh the dash board just came down
okay
this is the dash board
it fits in here alright
okay
no it doesn't have_to be screwed it needs to be slided
just slide it
let me see what xxx there you go
alright it looks to me like you can do almost everything with just the screw+driver
one more thing has_to come apart
beep beep
what has_to come apart
the horn is another screw
can you find the screw+driver in this
whole pile here
okay xxx
the whole thing came
that's why they call this a Take_apart car
and you just took it apart
without any help
cause you didn't need any help
now what
okay
what should we do first
well you know that thing on Sesame_street where the little boy gets lost and he is told to remember whatever he did last he should do first
and then he'd find his way back home again
well I think what we should do is try to remember what we took apart last and put that together first
what's the last thing we took apart
hm
the very last thing you did was the steering+wheel
let's do that first
oh you want to pretend that you're a mechanic
okay
okay
and those will be the guys who owned it
okay what're they gonna be doing while we're being mechanics
they're gonna wait
oh okay they're not going to take the bus back from Watertown Square are they
just like we did
yeah
are they waiting at the bus stop
okay let them wait at the bus stop

that wheel is broken
so you want to put that back in here
okay Debbie we need to have a bolt back here
wait a minute Debbie
I need a bolt back in here
can you slide that bolt in
okay it has_to be you using that tool
that's it
that's it
there we go Debbie

can I open up the front cover
it's called The_great_cat_chase
and this is a book
do these pictures like pictures in any other book you've got
this is a book by the same person who did that book What_do_you_do_with_a_kangaroo
you look at the pictures and see if they don't looks something like the kangaroo pictures okay
okay so let's see what's happening cause there aren't any words so you can tell me the story too
okay well here's a little girl and she's all dressed up with a hat and a purse
and she's got a doll carriage
and she's pretending to be a mommy
and who did she talk into being a baby
the kitty cat's being the baby
does that kitty cat look happy about it
no
I don't think he wants to be a baby
okay
so she turned around to pick a flower and what'd the kitty cat do
he hided
that's right
he jumped right out_of the carriage and went to hide behind the tree
and what did the little girl who's being the mommy say
you can't do that
where are you
where's my baby
where's my baby
and she went running along to find her baby
where is her baby
the cat that's being the baby
behind her
she doesn't see him she ran right past
and here's some other kids
all the kids in this neighborhood like to pretend to be people that they aren't
here's somebody pretending to be a
a policeman
and here's another kid on a tricycle
and he doesn't have much of a costume on but he is wearing cowboy boots
so he's probably pretending to be a cowboy
she went running saying
help help
my baby ran away
and what did the policeman do
he saw the baby
he said
there's your baby
there's your baby
what did the cat do
the cat said
uh oh
they found me
okay let's turn the page
okay so what did they say to the cat
look at the policeman
what's the policeman doing
what's that called
what does Michael the policeman do with his finger
beckoning
that's right
he's saying
come here kitty
you've got a cough huh
he's saying
come here kitty kitty kitty
and they go to chase the cat and the little girl
look at that
was standing on the policeman's coat so the policeman fell down
and off goes the cat and the boy who's pretending to be the cowboy is laughing
okay and they go to chase the cat he says
you're not going to get me here
and the cat goes into a great big pipe on the ground
and the cat is looking out the end of the pipe
and all the kids are crawling through
you think they're going to make it through
or do you think they're going to get stuck in the middle
I don't know either
let's turn the page and find out what happens
well out they come right into a mud puddle
did he fall in a mud puddle
yeah
and here's the little girl
and she says
you silly policeman the cat's going that way and there you were down in the mud puddle
so he helps the little girl out
uh oh
they both fall into the mud puddle
and the kitty goes and says
what's going on now
everybody's in the mud puddle and what did the kitty do
ran right back in the pipe
is there somebody else in that pipe
the cowboy's still there I think
yeah
so the little girl who's being the mommy and the kid who's being the policeman crawl back in after the cat
and they come out the other direction
and meanwhile the little boy who was the cowboy caught the cat
and here comes the kids through the pipe
oh no
oh no
what did he do
what did the cowboy do
he dropped that kitty right on the policeman's head
and now the policeman has a a cat hat instead of a policeman hat
and the kitty runs away again
and he goes up a tree
this is quite an adventure
and the policeman climbs the tree to get the kitty
and he finally gets the cat
the cat doesn't look too happy about being caught huh
and
oh_my_goodness
what happened there
he got caught
the branch broke
the branch broke and everybody fell down
and the kitty fell right into the mommy's hands
and they put the cowboy in the baby carriage
and the policeman needs a a stick to help him walk home
and the cat comes behind them
and the mommy goes in the house
and now what's she going to pretend to be
a nurse
but look what she brought for everybody
a pitcher of lemonade
and everybody's happy even the cat
you wanna read it again
