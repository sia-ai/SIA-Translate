Abe you're a little squealer
you're a little squealer
she what
she ate a feather
what
why'd she do that
what do you think would have happened if Mommy would have really eaten a feather

no
oh
I would have had a feather in my throat
and it would have tickled me
and I'd have coughed and coughed and coughed
huh
what did I do at school today
let me see
I have_to talk like this Abe
my throat hurts
I got some stuff to bring home to give to Nat's Mom and Dad

it looks like something died on my plate
my omelette
when you and Joey get up tomorrow wake me up okay
I don't want you to go outside or anything until I get up
who will
I have_to go to work tomorrow
how's that sausage taste
you know what
they're the same kind as the first ones
oh do you think they might taste better because you're so hungry
I should go outside with you everyday
so I can get fresh air too
uhhuh
good idea
it sure was
uhhuh
probably a hardboiled egg
no
what
uhhuh
going outside for a minute
what
I'll just be out for a minute
first what
I think so
I only have two more bites
I think there were more
as many dinosaurs as people
I'm not sure
so xxx
a butterfly
what happened
remember that whale that swallowed a beach ball
he probably just opened up his mouth to get some food
and the ball went in
it got stuck in his throat
and the whale couldn't breathe
when it died the waves just carried it to the shore
yeah
what do you want for breakfast
do you want one of these toasted
uhhuh
a little bowl of grapenuts and jello
okay do you want hot chocolate
okay
nobody
I did
we need to get milk today
what are we running out_of
do you think we should keep all the shelves full all of the time
we have more bad new Abe
Steve and Marsha called and they aren't going to be able to come up here
it was really strange
I tried to call them
but their line was busy
so I hung up the phone
and guess what happened
they called us
I called them while they were trying to call us
isn't that strange
what
for what
what kind of cereal
if they're on sale we'll get them
maybe Santa'll put some in your stocking
sometimes he leaves stuff like that
you'll have_to write a letter and tell him to bring our gifts here instead of to Texas
yeah but not on Christmas day
we'll be here then
all of our friends in Texas
why do you think they can't mail them
I think we'd get them before
then we're going to mail our gifts to Texas
no way
do you have diarrhea
I really do
those were good Thanksgiving pictures
Jean liked them
and Lyle liked them
and I know Daddy liked them
where are you going
I can go down right now
I know
I'm just going down for a second
we both have_to go to the dentist in January
in February
some do
some do
yeah
it looks like some birds have eaten some of the bread

huh
uhhuh see that number fifteen Abe
with the yellow circle around it
I mean a yellow square
guess whose birthday that is
seventeen
what would you do if I stole all your gifts
I better not do it then
she can't come
know why
uhhuh
well I suggested that
but it still costs too much
Grandma said
I spent all my money on as gifts
and I don't have any left to let Karen fly up
yeah
yeah
uhhuh which do you think Mike would like
a cowboy jacket or a zebra robe
no it has_to one or the other
do you think he'd like it
oh Abe
oh
he has magical powers
I think I'll stay up real late this year and see if I can see Santa when he comes to our house
if he sees me he won't leave any presents for anybody
that'd be okay
oh should we leave him a carrot to eat
I hope he doesn't bring the reindeer in the house
they'd make a real mess
in Dayton's
I can't remember
they also had some beautiful wreaths that we can make
it's a kit
uhhuh
uhhuh
good idea
there's a bug
climbing up the wall by Abe's pictures
do you think that would work
how come
I don't know
it might just be a waste of tape
okay
no just regular
what what's doing
don't turn it up
I don't want to listen to it
it's okay like it is
do you want something to drink
okay
huh
I've got the tape recorder on

alright
good
it was a good thing
it was Shannon's and Jason's
I don't think Chris knows where Jason lives
he does
Abe got a surprise at the barber shop Dad
it looks like he got surprised
