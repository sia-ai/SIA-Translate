that very night in Max's room a forest grew

and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and his walls became the world all around
and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day
what's he doing
he's in a boat
and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are

do you think they're scary

till Max said be still
and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all

and they danced by the light of the moon
and they hung from the trees
and they had their wild thing parade
now stop Max said and sent the wild things to bed without their supper
and Max the king of all wild things was lonely
and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all
and all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat
so he gave up being king of where the wild things are
but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so
and Max said no
the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws
but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
