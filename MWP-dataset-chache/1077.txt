so we visit him at his house
church is God's house
we pray in church praying is like talking to God
I love you is a prayer God always likes to hear
we can also say thank you God or help me God or gee God I'm sorry
we listen to God's words in church too
he speaks to us through stories from a book called the Bible
in the Bible God tells us about himself and how he wants us to live
when we think about God at church
no there's no more pages about how wonderful he is and how good he is to us
we think about all he has given up
what
right
what's this
right
what else do we do at church
we sing songs that we sing wait a minute we sing
songs that we sing at church are called hymns
God is happy when he hears us sing
when we leave church we say bye God I'll visit again soon
