here do you want some more hot chocolate
it's cooled off by now
what are you thinking about
what was on your mind
what did you think about
Lou
your friend
what kind of river is it
oh a real gentle river
it's easy to canoe on a gentle river isn't it
when is it hard to canoe
snowy
what about when the river's flowing real rapidly
what do the ships do in Alou
what do the canoes do
what do the canoes do
oh what do they do with the turtles
they have new homes
so they'd have their friends there
who's in the canoe doing all that
you would
what would you use to catch the turtles
you don't think the turtle would be too heavy
oh a baby one
how could you find one that's as small as a pinhead
I thought you said the river's name was Alou
the malous live in the Alou
what do the cows do when they get there
who teaches the cows how to swim
how do they do it
do they kick and paddle
hawks do
remember when we went to Texas and saw all those hawks
where were they sitting
on top of telephone poles
they aren't bird hawks
uhhuh
they have big beaks
different from what
chicken hawks
I really like that elephant mask
what did you do then
just the bun
what did it taste like
mustard
did you drink all your hot chocolate
here I'll show you how
oh Abe that would be so nice
you should probably use both hands
pull it apart
no it's pretty late right now
tomorrow we can ride our bikes to the store if it warms up
no I don't think you need a new purse
what makes you think it's getting old
those are ink ink marks
this is just the right size for you
what part
oh it has one little rip
do you want me to pull you
okay
not tonight Abe
have you and Daddy been watching cartoons
yesterday
hey you're not supposed to throw books
what are you making
look what shape did you make
okay go get some things and put them on here and sing the song
and I'll guess the answer
this one is different
because it only has one block
but this one is different
because it has a colored block
and these are all wooden
which answer's right
because it's not a puzzle piece
pretty clever
go ahead
that's a hard puzzle isn't it
okay let's figure out the easiest way to do it
put the large triangle in first
okay what shape is this
remember
asymmetrical
well how can we find it
look and see
it's too bad your lollipop had to break Abe
that's right
that's right Abe
how come
how did I scare you away
you enjoyed that didn't you
okay let's look at it first
I thought you were going to take them out one at a time
so you could put them back in
uhhuh did you tell Daddy what happened when we were going to make Ukranian eggs the first time
and then what happened
no I'm talking about this morning
when we did it before you took a nap
what happened
remember
I said
Abe don't play with those until I come over there
then what happened
uhhuh then what
I bent down
and then what happened

fire's really dangerous
hey I see a_lot_of neat shapes in this puzzle
look
where did it land Abe
what shape is this
a big old heart
or Minnie_Mouse
what's Minnie_Mouse wear in her hair
uhhuh
or a wrench
what's that one
oh look you can tell where the pink goes
no the pink goes at the top
why are you throwing the pieces
you missed
watch out Abe
you hit me right in the face
this puzzle's just a little too hard for you isn't it
does your sore still hurt
hey you know what
if you keep throwing those pieces around you're going to lose em
do you wanna show Daddy how to make Ukranian Easter eggs
why don't you just tell me how
why don't you tell Dad while I get the stuff ready
I remember the one you made me last year
do you remember
I remember somebody broke it too

because it keeps falling apart
where's the ax one
