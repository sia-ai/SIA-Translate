I'll give them back now Adam
where's the box
that's not a box
it's supposed to be a case
what
well then I guess the nurses would have_to take care of people
well we really would have quite a few sick people
then maybe each person would have_to take care of himself
alright
don't take his things Adam
here you are Adam
you can't even what
they're cotton balls
for cleaning things
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton
Diandra why are you tearing it up
that's right
what time is it Adam
oh dear
maybe you should keep the things we want to keep away from there
Diandra no
you're tearing up too much
that wouldn't be nice to do
would you like for me to leave you down here without any dinner

Diandra no more dear
you're just tearing up too much paper
oh did he say what I said
it's a pill box

no
give you out
what does that mean
oh I should give you out and that means spank you
you're giving me a shot to make me feel better
ah
what's wrong doctor
no he thinks you're checking him too
the things you need that the doctor uses
it's a supply cabinet isn't it
I don't think you put the medicine in there
I think you put the tongue depressor in there and other things like that
I don't think so
that's for taking medicine
no liquid medicine
do you have a bottle of medicine
you need to do what
rash
what kind of rash
oh I see you put some medicine on my hand and washed it off
he's taking a rash off my hand

just like you blew up the duck
you watch and see how Robin does it
there it comes see
there it is
it will take time it has_to grow
alright
it looks like an old+fashioned light bulb
smoking a peace pipe
that's right
but you're losing too much air
try to get the air down through the hole
you blow and let me go get Paul and Diandra
now it looks like a street light
what do you think it looks like
yours looks like a dirigible the kind of balloon people used to fly inside of
is it made of marble
no probably something like rubber
no it's just very big
bigger than this room
yes that balloon is strong
do you want to make a little bigger
enough
I'm going to take a little air out_of mine
how did he do it
I don't think that's how
try it
I think you could
it's easier the second time
keep your mouth tight around the pipe
this long stem
what do you call it
no
it's plastic
what do you think the balloon is made of
made of what
I think they get it inside of certain trees in South America
rubber
to make tires and balloons and rubber bands

what
you could play it with Robin
how do you play it
if you see what
you just made that up
stamps

paper clips
those are made out_of metal
no balloons are made out_of rubber
xxx are made out_of wood
