that was still a good telling of the story
do you remember what happens at the beginning

um hm and then Sully closed it that's right
remember it was the hood it was the front part of the car that's where Mike fell in right
and Sully closed him in there on accident right
okay and do you remember any of the other parts that happened
it was great so Sully was on the sidewalk and then ah Mike drove off in the car but then he wheels fell off right

and then he flew back to Sully so he went flying out the window probably right
and then what did Sully do
catched him that's right

you can do a head stand
wow
you wanna do one
there you go
oh wow
it's not good on wood
is this wood
what would you call this
wood
it's actually I don't exactly know what it is it's not wood

linoleum
big word
yeah isn't that a funny big word linoleum
can you say linoleum
sure you can
what
oh you are so close
linoleum
that was good
that is an interesting word
now how'd you learn how to do a head stand
you just knew how
that's pretty neat
now should we scare Ryan
uh oh
Ryan's got he's gotta close his eyes
okay
okay now what should he do
I'm afraid
oh my what is that

whatchu have in your hand right there
a doctor thing huh
what do you do with it
oh yeah
so are you really sick
no
oh okay
you don't need your heart checked
who me
yeah I think I'm a little sick
actually this part goes on your heart
put this part right here and you can listen right
and then this part goes on the person's heart
what do you think
oh no
what do I need to do if I am sick
just lie down
all day
all day
all day what am I supposed to do while I am laying down
lay
well what if I get bored then what am I supposed to do

just sleep a little longer
alright
can I get up now
what
that was small
what was small
what
oh my nap my nap was small
well maybe I'm just a tiny bit sick
so does that mean I have_to stay in bed just all day or like tomorrow and the next day
how many days
oh my five days
now what am I gonna do with my classes that I'm supposed to teach tomorrow
I can just lay down
who is gonna teach my classes for me
oh boy
Ryan
well you know what that sounds like a good idea except Ryan is in one of my classes
would he have_to teach himself
well holy cow
what would I teach
Monster's Inc
maybe I could have you help me teach it
you know more about it than I do
how should he learn about it to teach it
oh yeah
get water and put it on his head
that would make Ryan very very wet
he may not like that
I was wondering I was thinking that maybe you were looking very cold
let's wrap you up
now do you know what you look like
a mummy that could look like a mummy
I thought you actually looked like a sandwich
you know how sometimes you have a sandwich and it's all rolled up in the bread like this
what kind of sandwich are you
what kind would you wanna be
oh do you wanna be the sandwich that daddy eats
you're not sure what kind of sandwich that is
well that would mean that daddy's gonna come home and eat you
is that a good idea
alright well do you wanna play with your rocks on here
just throw them like a dice
I'm gonna roll them on here though
that's what I was thinking you were thinking
I'm not throwing them because we're rolling them
you gotta roll them like a dice
oh how'd that work out
that's five
that looks like rolling it like a dice yeah
that one fell off
why did that one fall off
oh that one just xxx on the edge
I remember Matty when you were a baby you used to pretend that people were in the different lines like so these guys are in lines
what are they in lines for
he broke their spot
because he did he rolled right in there and these guys were like hey hey you cut in front of me go to the back of the line
well these guys that have been here they've been waiting a long time right
they don't want him to go in front where should he go
and then that will go over there so he doesn't want to go on the plane
oh okay
the bunny's gonna go on the plane too
so is this the front of the line or the back of the line which one's the front
that's the front I see
where are they gonna fly to
they're gonna fly up up up where the dinosaurs are wow
that is very high
we flew a plane that one plane remember where they took a magic school bus
oh this is the magic school bus
oh so this is the magic school bus all these guys are gonna go on the magic school bus instead of a plane
is that what you were thinking about
yes
oh
they're all on it so where's the magic school bus gonna go
well let's get the dinosaurs up then so that they can see them all
so these guys are coming by the dinosaurs is that what they're doing
whoa so what should these people do then
what are they doing
running away yeah
these dinosaurs are like hey where did they go I'm so hungry
uh oh we're gonna get them
um tasty
oh they eat little dinosaurs yeah sometimes that's what would happen the big ones would eat the little ones
is he eating them
he says he wants to eat some of them too huh
hey what's that car door mean
did you hear a car door
a car door
um hm daddy came home but he went in the back I don't think he's coming inside yet
so where did you get all these rocks at
the beach is that where they were from
where's the other place where you get a lot of these rocks from
from the school and from the beach yep
what is your idea with the dinosaurs
do that
so you wrapped him up
oh you want me to wrap you up and show daddy what you can make
yes
actually I don't know if I can wrap you this way
what happens if I try to wrap you this way what happens with the material is there not enough
why don't you lay the other way it will wrap a little better
let's turn it this way
try to think about it how did we do it the other time
okay is there a different way that you could lay maybe
and then it would fit
I don't know
how about another idea
would you like to be a sandwich or would you like to be a mummy
you wanna what
you want to be like a mummy
yes that would be like all covered up
what were the mummies wrapped in
cloth
what do the mummies do
scare people
that's what they do I think they do but um where do the mummies live do you remember
in heaven
the Anakin bank
so the Anakin bank is do you know where
you know where I think he is
I think he's in the living room isn't he
okay hurry
do you know it's in the living room Matty
alrighty come on over here
I don't think that Ryan has actually seen that
no
what is that
do you want to show him but do you know what how do you think Ryan's going to feel when you show him the other side
okay show him
scared
uh oh
okay now what about that side who's on that side
Anakin
and then
oh_my_goodness who is that
Dark Vader

why don't you get a penny then if you wanna do these little games on here then then we need a coin okay
well a coin is any of those things so a coin could be a penny it could be the nickel a coin is the name for all the different ones
so pick anyone you know pick any penny or nickel or dime anything you want
you wanna use that one okay

do we want to do that one
what do you think about swords

how many did we find
you know this is kind of funny this says this is for the Zevenberten family
is that our name Zevenberten
what's our name
yes isn't that silly
so they did not spell it right they wrote Zevenberten and we say Zeven
yeah they had a T instead of a G
should we do this one
okay we gotta find a word with the letters

luck is luck the same as buck
no
how about this one
duck that's not right either
oh we don't get that book we did not win that one
luck and duck but we're supposed to find buck so that's not the same
do you wanna keep these
do you wanna cut them out or do you wanna throw them away
you actually you know what you're supposed to do with them
rip
I know how you like to do that sometimes
because it's not strong
how about I'll start and then you do the rest
there you go
so you know how Dr Weist listens to our tape do you want to tell Dr Weist about your new tortoise
Dr Weist
well tell him about your new tortoise what's the tortoise's name
Sesame
so what does Sesame do
where'd you get Sesame at
I don't know
what kinda store
what did they have at that pet store
can I do it for you sure
what other animals did they have there at the pet store
oh that's why you flipped it over because you didn't want to have the sword
because it's not nice to have the sword right
yeah
sure
so we got Sesame at the pet store and you wouldn't believe it Ryan and sometimes what do we have what does he do he comes out of his cage and then what does he do
what does Sesame do when he's out of his cage
forget
well he walks around the house and doesn't he this was so funny do you remember where did he go
in the corner
but where did he go inside there
in the garage
in the garage
what was he doing in there
I don't know either
that was silly though wasn't it he was crawling around in the garage
he went in there all by himself
it was very funny
so let's try to think about what else have we been doing
we've been playing with Sesame since we saw Ryan
what's the movie you've been watching all the time
do you remember what's the movie we've been watching almost everyday
I don't think it's actually on here
the movie that we saw is it in one of these books
it's not in it
what
what's the movie that we've been watching everyday
I'll give you a hint
Beauty and the
so what happens to that beast in the movie do you remember
hm let's see
well the Beast was he always a beast or did he used to be something else
what did he used to be
um hm
so in the movie the prince turns into the Beast and then who comes to his house
remember Belle's daddy went to go see him at the house
and then the Beast says you are not welcome here
do you remember that
and what does he do with Belle's daddy
where does he put him
you are so silly you watch this movie like everyday
you don't remember huh
where did he put that older man
in the
in the dungeon
I'll just ask you one more
what does Belle have_to do in order for him to become a prince again
give him a kiss
and does she do that
no
yes
you're such a silly one
we've been also working on new puzzles we got
what are the new puzzles of do you remember
here I'll give you a hint
Sully puzzle
no
remember there's a meat eater and a couple of plant eaters
right a meat eating what
what kind of animal is it
oh a dinosaur
let's pretend that you are a new baby and that we do not know how to do this yet
do you know how to do this
oh you do know how to do it
oh that didn't open
I'll pretend that I'm the new baby and that I don't know how to do it
what do I do
oh so the new baby would just know how to do it huh
well what if you had to tell the new baby how to do it
what if the new baby said Momma how do I do this
what would you tell the new baby
you would not tell the new baby
you would just show the new baby probably right
well let's think about what you want to play with because you're being kind of quiet
do you want to pretend that we're at the store
oh I like that game
I like that game too
can I go shopping again
yeah
alrighty so Ryan is going to shop first are you gonna ring him up
I think I wanna buy this
can I open that for you
there
you have quite a bit of money in there
how'd you get all this money
is that for Ryan to use
yep okay cool
because he has to pay for the ball right
so you have_to give this to Ryan so that he can pay
okay I want one of these please
how much is it
five cents
okay
is that enough
yeah okay
then can he take his ball
yeah okay
how about does he get any money back
alright I have money to go shopping for some more stuff now
what should I buy what do you think is good to buy over here
maybe this
who is that guy
Sponge Bop
now see I don't know who Sponge Bop is
what does he do
I don't know either
do you remember where he lives
he lives in a pineapple
does he eat pineapple too
no he just lives in there
yep he lives in the pineapple that's true
does he live on a mountain
he lives in a pineapple
but where is the pineapple
under the sea
so he lives under the sea in a pineapple
that is silly but true
now I have a question for you
what's coming up that is kind of like a holiday and you gotta dress up
do you know
Halloween yep are you gonna dress up
yeah
what're you gonna be
a fireman oh boy
do you have a costume

that's right
now did you dress up last year for Halloween
you don't remember who you were for Halloween last year
I'll give you a hint it was somebody red
somebody red that is from Sesame Street
oh Elmo okay
remember the last time I was here you dressed up as something
do you remember that
I don't know
something with did we use toilet paper maybe
and I wrapped you up
what were you pretending to be

so for Halloween do you remember what do people do on Halloween
oh yummy
okay how do we get the candy
do we take it from the store
yep we go to the people's houses and what'd we say
do you remember that part what do we say when we knock on their door
I don't know if you remember that
you do remember that
well I'm gonna pretend that I'm gonna come and knock on your door and then we'll see if you give me any candy
okay knock knock knock trick or treat
is this my candy
oh oh well let's pretend I say um um do you happen to have any gum
oh thank you that is so nice
so then I would say thank you
so yes Halloween so we are gonna go trick or treating and we're gonna get candy and we're gonna dress you up in your costume and what else do people do on Halloween
do you remember what do people do with their pumpkins on Halloween
what do they carve them into
do you know what they're called when they're carved
I don't know if we ever talked about jack_o_lanterns
have you heard of that before
now remember last year we had to decide do you remember what kind of pumpkin face we wanted to make
remember we said do we want to make a sad one or a scary one or a mean one remember what kind we had last night or last year
you said I wanna sad one and we made a sad one
how are we gonna do it this year
a scary one
that should be fun
we had a bunch of pumpkins outside but now they're gone
or are they in the front
yeah they're for decoration in the front
so what should we do with all that money
what could we buy with all that money you got
um I think I wanna buy Sponge Bop
he's got his money
how much is it
two cents
I don't know if I have enough money
well will that work
does he get any change back
yeah
oh neat
hey thank you
cool so now he's got Sponge Bob
do you think Ryan's really gonna take those home for real
no okay
where do you think he'd keep Sponge Bob if he took him home
just for decoration that's true
now I see you have something new on your arm today
oh it is
what's a watch what'd you do with it
it just popped out that's kind of funny
so what time is it Boo
you want me to just see

yeah it's about five to five
no it is right I think actually
five to five yeah
so it is it's a cool watch
sometimes we've been starting to learn how to tell time on it but it's hard
Matty do you remember what it is when the big hand is on the twelve what do we say five
five cents five o
five o nine
five o'clock
five o'clock it'll be five o'clock in a little bit
is that one still popping out
how come it won't pop out anymore
I don't know
that's what I was wondering
why do you think that won't pop out anymore
and is it gonna fix it
is it gonna kinda make it pop back up after being in there
I have something to show you
you can stay right here I'll show you what we got in the mail today that was interesting
well we got the card for the science museum
we have our membership cards
look at this isn't that totally cool
look at this what is this that you can put on your car
a dinosaur sticker
you know you can have that where would you want to put that
well you just stick it
see it comes off and you can stick it on a window or on your car or something
you might have_to turn it the other way
yeah
is it cool
now it says that we're members
pretty neat huh
that means that we can go all the time to the museum
what's at the museum
lions
I don't know
yeah where do we see the lions
yeah where do we see those
yeah at the zoo
what other kinds of animals do they have at the zoo

um hm actually it's true
yep yep
they look black but they're actually brown
what other what other kind what animal does a zebra look like
what other kind of an animal that they're kind of like
I don't know if they would have these at the zoo or not
kinda like a kinda like a horse
yeah if you look at zebras they kind of look like horses just with stripes
I'll have_to show you sometime they kind of look the same
what did you and daddy see at the zoo the last time you went
didn't you see something different that you had never seen before at that zoo
what's the one's that go like
oh an alligator
oh boy they're kind of scary don't you think
oh he was in a cage
what was he doing in his cage
just swims
oh yeah
guess what my grandpa had a pet alligator
a little one yep
that's kinda silly does grandpa Zevenbergen have a pet alligator
how about grandpa Dale
no
that is a funny idea
I wonder where did your grandpa live that he had one
right in town
he had a pet skunk too once
he pet deer horses
wow all kinds of stuff that's kind of interesting
a pet chair
that could be your pet chair
so um so so you guys went to the zoo with daddy
I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing
so did we go see daddy's float the other day
yeah
whatchu doing
because you want to stand on your chair
where do you want to stand on your chair to
what do you want to do
do you want to get something from up there
what are you gonna get done
what's that
bubble maker yes
you want to try to get the baby down
let me see where is the baby
see his leg oh yes I see his leg
here here's your baby
let's pretend that this is his crib
that can't fit in there
how about you can make this a crib and then you could grab a blanket
what do you think of that
here we go
so what does your baby do
he cries what else does he do
oh that's nice you're gonna give him a toy
what if the baby was scared
let's see how do you do this
oh my you push that little part that makes a funny noise
whoa the baby would say
does the baby like that toy
good_night little baby
oh that was nice
he did you taught him how to do it
the little baby pushed it
is it hard for him to push it
yeah well maybe he just needs practice
oh see he did it now you showed him how to do it
alright
just a little one
oh that's nice Matty
yeah show him a different toy maybe he'd like to play with a different toy
oh yeah we were talking about that one
it's very big well how would you tell the baby how to do that
what if the baby thought all those were real and she got scared
what would you tell her if she was scared and she thought they were real
they're not real just pretend
she does not need to be scared
is your baby a boy or a girl
what's the baby boy's name
so I wanna see what one of the meat eaters
yeah do you wanna bring this one over sweetie
that one's a meat eater
wow so it looks like almost all of them are
how do you know Boo how do you know that they are meat eaters
he's plant eater so he would eat those right
now which how come this one's kind of different
what does this one do that's kinda different
oh he flys
what does he eat then
oh other dinosaurs
how do you know that we can't see his teeth so how do you know
what was he trying to eat in the movie do you remember
trying to eat an egg
another dinosaur egg
so that's good that's how you know he wants to eat meat
what did the mommy think when he was trying to eat the egg
oh that was the mommy one
I wonder what this thing is
what's that do you know
oh it's a mountain
hey look are those eggs right there
oh so that way we could pretend that that one's going to eat those eggs
unless maybe we gotta try to protect the eggs
yeah bring all those over there I haven't even seen those
these are cool
probably a plant eater
how much did dinosaurs eat do you think did they eat a lot
holy cow that is pretty big
that's a lot of food
I know
so are there any other ones over there
oh a little triceratops
what'd you do today at school that maybe got you a little bit cold
maybe somebody else
oh you didn't bring medicine
do you need medicine now
okay that's good
you guys did something that was fun today at school though that made people maybe a little bit wet
what was that
um hm
what'd you guys do in the rain
as this one
oh my gosh which one might be the mommy one
I kinda like that one
I like his little spikes right there
he looks kind of mean though do you think maybe he was kind of a mean dinosaur
a plant eater oh
so are the plant eaters nice ones
oh
oh he eats both
um hm he could be definitely some of them ate both right
I like that one too
he's kind of a cool color
yeah
these are neat
oh look he's hungry Matt he's trying to eat the plants
well what happens in that dinosaur movie
um hm the big ones chased the plant eating dinosaurs yes that's right
well what happened in the movie that everybody had to leave and find another place to live
what happened then
so I remember what you're saying so it's actually you have almost the word right it's not meat eater it's meteor meteor shower
that's when the big big meteor came down and went
what happened when he came down show me again
and then that's right and then it made a big big big fireball and then they couldn't live there anymore right
so then what did they do as a group
um hm
where did they find to live
um hm they were finding a new place
oh the meteor shower and the big fire thing
it's just like here they can't live here anymore right
no what would this be like if they lived right on top of there
it would fire them yep
they'd get all burned
this one reminds me of the one in the movie that remember he's kind of a little he's kind of little like a little dog
do you remember he kind of looked like that one
now do we still have that dinosaur movie
no you and daddy did not return it yet
huh you guys gotta return it
we should have it for a few weeks
maybe
that sounds like a good movie
I think I should watch it
um hm
that is a good movie
there's some sad parts in the movie though what are the sad parts
you don't remember any sad parts in the movie
oh okay that's good
I know your nose is itchy right
well tonight actually you could in some ways you might even want to see if remember we were going to Walmart
you lost your mittens
well actually you didn't lose your boots what do you think happened to them
you think somebody ended up taking them
well actually you know what happened to your boots is that you got too big for them
they don't fit anymore
somehow we need to get new ones
now what was something you did at school today that you needed boots for
for the rain yep
you gotta be really careful because Ryan brought this and you don't want it to get mushed up like it could get ripped right
and then these guys would go ah ah my home is all wrecked
could be that they could turn into a real dinosaur
what do you think it would be like if we had a dinosaur in our house
oh the meat eater could chase us it could happen
that'd be scary
what'd you think about if we got_to pick would you want a plant eater at our house or a meat eater
we could
well should we put them oh maybe oh no I won't say that that's too mean
I was thinking about the mean neighbor from before maybe she would like the meat eating dinosaur
do you think so
yeah maybe
so um I'm trying to think if we've done anything since we saw Ryan
well this weekend remember we went to stay in a hotel one day what did we do at the hotel
we were playing silly sentence yes
we'll have_to maybe show Ryan that game sometime
yeah I want to know how to play that game
oh yeah
what'd you do with the pictures
one line okay
and you make up little sentences with the words and some of them are be silly
like it might be something like what if it said something like the cat ate a what what would be silly
oh my see that would be silly wouldn't it
and you can make them anyway you want
we'll have_to play that sometime
yeah we could bring it in yeah and play with it sometime
so we played silly sentences in the hotel and then what else did we do
what did we do in our room with our bathing suits
you went swimming
oh boy was it inside then
oh the water came out of the jets
now see do you know how to swim then
yeah
how do you do it
you just do that
he and his daddy used to go swimming a_lot in the summer right
oh yeah
in the big swimming pool
there's only one problem with the big swimming pool though at the college
what's wrong with that
it's too cold
now can you breathe when you are under water
no what do you gotta do then
oh you just hold your nose
do you want to look for something honey
oh my gosh is he going to eat something
well if you were a dinosaur what kind of dinosaur would you want to be a plant eater or a meat eater
a meat eater oh boy
I think I kind of would too
you would
uh I would be a nice one
a nice one
or maybe one that flies
that would be pretty cool
how do you hook that on to something
um I'm not sure if this goes with that
I'm not really that knowledgeable about farm machinery
that does
oh how do you think it hooks
you do it like that
okay now what do you do with that
oh huh maybe like this
would that work
oh can it go like that
cool
so how does this work
do you remember what this is called
I don't know it was sitting out before wasn't it
I saw it on the xxx table this morning right
weren't we using the money on there
I'll just get a couple more coins quick
or is there anything else that would work on there
okay yeah see how that would work
okay so the little dinosaur then
okay so that might be he might be too big for that
how about this part would he go on here
oh yeah what'd you think of that
you wanna be the one
okay
that's how you usually do it
so you really do need money right
do you want me to go run and get a couple pennies quick
okay well let's just run real quick
what did you do
huh you know that reminds me what happened to my knee
do you remember what happened to my knee
I was skating and I hit it yeah
ouch
that's another thing he does not know that we did
we went where did we go
oh you want to show my leg
what were you skating on
yeah what were we skating on
wasn't that kind of slippery on the ice
okay put your hand there where here at the end
oh okay so show me how you got_to do it then
and then what can I do with the money
oh
okay
you're the one that does everything
aren't I supposed to be the one that catches the money though
okay so that can be my job
okay let's see if I can
whoa is it broken
oh I see
okay I think it's getting ready
okay
I'm just the catcher okay
so I catch it in my hand and then
and then what do we do with it when it's in there
well my it fell out already
what'd they use these for do you know
they just hold stuff
so did we count how many we had
how many did we get
you're gonna do everything right
oh wait what are you going to do to those things
oh I was wondering if you were going to try to keep them
what can you buy with those
it's not very working
well that's what I thought
it sounded like it was getting stuck or something
it wasn't turning real well
okay is it coming
oh no I wonder if it it's almost like it's not turning real well now
I wonder what's wrong with it
who did this used to belong to
yeah it might be because it's getting older
it doesn't turn so well anymore
yeah that's true
what do you think farmers put in that
do you think farmers collect money in there
maybe could be
so after daddy gets home after supper what did we say we are gonna do
do you remember what are we gonna do tonight
now you're busy right
only two gonna go in there
here do you wanna move that over here
hey I wonder if the dinosaurs would like to play on here
maybe this could be there new land
how did they get over there did they just jump or how did they get over to their new land
they walked
oh wow I'm so happy that this is our new land
what could this part be maybe for the new land
oh my the tree is gonna jump over
that's amazing
well that one looks like a scary guy
uh oh you know when they went to that new land they actually didn't have any meat eaters
do you think the meat eaters should be allowed to come
yeah
oh no he does not want to get eaten
he's actually too spiky
he is protected
I wanna be this guy right here
yeah he wouldn't run to very well
the brontosauruses were really kind of slow too because they were so heavy
so they would have_to definitely watch out for him
how could he protect himself do you think the brontosaurus
yeah poor poor brontosaurus
oh that's just a little baby one
oh no
