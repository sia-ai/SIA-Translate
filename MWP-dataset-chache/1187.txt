the abridged version
Laney Lamb and Lily Bunny were best friends
everyday they met in the wildflower meadow just as the warm spring sun first sparkled on the morning dew
hooray squealed Lily she hopped even higher than before did a somersault and landed gracefully in the soft spring grass
awesome cried a strange deep voice
but it wasn't Laney's voice and it wasn't Lily's voice
there was a bright green frog
that was excellent he croaked
oh hello Fritz said Laney
hi said Fritz the frog I hope I'm not interrupting you
this is my friend Lily Bunny Laney said
oh nice to meet you Fritz croaked
but Lily just nodded at Fritz and looked away
she didn't like the thought of sharing the meadow and her friend with a stranger
Lily scowled she wanted Laney to pay attention to her
but Laney was so busy performing for Fritz she didn't hear
all that morning Laney played with Fritz while Lily stayed by herself at the far end of the meadow meadow
come on Lily Laney bleated Fritz is picking watercress for us and it's delicious
Lily stamped one of her big back feet and glared angrily at Laney
look she said you can play with that frog all you want but if you're going to be friends with him you can't be friends with me
why said Laney feeling very sad and confused
because said Laney that's just the way it is
the next morning Lily didn't go to the wildflower meadow but went to have breakfast on the other side of the grassy hill
and there she met Penelope Pig
well here's a surprise I thought you'd be with Laney
you're best friends aren't you
we were but now she wants to play with some frog
well maybe I can help said Penelope I know a lot about friends and friendship
the little what
little lamb
oh the little piggie
yeah there's the Penelope Pig
ah if I'm not mistaken you're upset because Laney wants to play with Fritz but it's perfectly fine to have more than
she is big
it's perfectly fine to have more than one good friend at a time
friendship is the perfect thing to share and having more friends mean having more fun
Penelope walked away leaving Lily alone
Penelope thinks she's so smart Lily thought but she doesn't understand
Lily started to eat but the plants were not as sweet as the ones by the pond
and she heard the laughter and shouting of two voices
she saw Laney and Fritz picking flowers together
they've got some nerve she said making all that racket
whatever they're doing they're certainly having fun they don't need my help and that's fine with me
that afternoon Lily was sulking in the shade of a tree and Fritz hurried up and called Lily come quick Laney wants you right away
what does she want Lily asked coldly but Fritz had already hurried back over the hill
huh it's probably nothing but I'll still go and see she said
when she got there she found Laney and Fritz proudly displaying a beautiful Lily sized necklace
how do you like it said Laney
is it for me she said
we made it just for you said Laney because you're my very best friend
and because I'd like to be your friend too Fritz said
oh what a beautiful necklace she said I've been so selfish
that's okay Laney said we didn't mean to leave you out I just got so excited about having a new friend that I forgot about our game
I was selfish too
well I'm sorry said Lily I hope it's not too late for us to have some fun together
so for the rest of the day the three friends romped and frolicked in the meadow
I'm glad to see Lily and Laney are friends again Penelope said
it was my advice that got them back together you know
early the next morning Lily Laney and Fritz met by the pond and all three had great fun together
this spring will be the best ever because now I even have more friends than before
yay
you're gonna eat me up
no
oh you're eating
what
oh you're gonna sing twinkle twinkle little star
alright let's hear it
yay bravo
I have some presents
how nice
for you
xxx thank you c_ds for Mommy
in the form of xxx c_ds it's been a while xxx
oh my god I was watching some of Lily's
these are the c_ds of when Jenny takes movies of us when she's here and then she brings us the little movies to play on the computer
I was looking at ones of her when she was gosh maybe just two or like year and a half
and uh and um Manuela was still here and she was going through the colors with her
oh yeah
or it was a little book with different colors and pink was pink
and purple was purple
and flower flower flower
flower you're so cute
xxx we were talking
we were talking about her the other day at this meeting we were having
uhhuh
oh where's your clip Babes
um
I was talking about when you were talking when you were just learning to talk when you were a baby
when you were a little girl
um there's a couple tapes where she's like learning her states I guess
oh yes
and everyone was really impressed
xxx yeah
I mean none of the other kids know their states
and the funny thing is she's gone through things where she'll become really obsessed with some field of study and at that point she must have been two or just like two and a quarter or something like that
look at your mustache
and she had a place mat with all with the United States and
that's a good thing actually maybe we'll look at your map in a while because now like I xxx any recollection xxx
now she still
yeah should we look at your map and see how many states you know now
you used to know like half the states when you were two
we probably don't even know that many now right
so she'll go through things where she'll know like xxx
I probably don't even know that many now
seriously my like
geography study
and dinosaur study has increased tenfold
yes your map
that's great that she does that though I feel like that's a great thing xxx
yeah but she'll be like oh I you know every other kid will be like I speak seven languages
she'll be like I speak English slang English colloquial English
and I can count to ten in Spanish
we can probably do three in Spanish whatever Dora teaches you
okay let's see
where's your little oh Debbie was here Honey and I had to give her something then I forgot
oh well oh well
oh here's your map
here's your little map
and the other funny thing about Lily when she was doing all her states is she would only look at the um map of the United States upside down
we would give it to her right side up and she would say no it's upside down and she would turn it over
whoa I wonder where she got that idea from
you are silly should we look at our states
alright let's see what we can remember
let's see
do you remember
Texas that's a big one
nice
and Florida sure
yeah look at the teeny tiny
that is Rhode Island
right and do you remember this one
that is New York you're right
wow
and let's see do you remember this big one over here
this is the one where they
that's right it's California
let's see what else do you remember this one above Florida right above Florida
that's the one where they grow peanuts
Georgia
oh my gosh wow okay do you remember this one
I'll give you a hint you know who lives here
xxx no
Alaska is actually over here which is really Alaska's really up here but it didn't fit in the map so they put it down here
uh Matthew lives here
Virginia right
now let's see do you remember xxx do you remember this one
next to California
oh cheese the cheese state is over here
remember what the cheese state is called
it's called Wisconsin
this one is Nevada
Nevada
we were all really anxious no one has actually phonetically transcribed her file yet someone was just preparing it and saw that
oh yeah
but we were really curious to see you know because they're really long names for kids to pronounce so we were really curious to see
oh you mean the states and stuff like that
if she would be yeah
if she would be good at saying the names
oh
oh that's interesting
um whether
xxx here we go xxx
there we go why do you like to look at the map upside down
you are so silly
yes
like that silly
no that's the way Florida goes
Florida's like a little tail
at the end
it's like a little leg
let's see do you remember um
let's see oh
this state do you remember this one this is the one where David grew up
do you remember what it is
is it Minnesota
no
is it Kentucky
no
is it Montana
what is it where did David grow up
in Iowa
I know one person actually grew up in Iowa and we know scary
one of my best friends in college xxx
xxx was like Iowa what
I know like how what is it like five people live there or something xxx
like everyone everyone's like in a cornfield
yes Honey
let's see what else
yeah what's that one
oh Virginia's the yellow one where Matthew lives remember
that's South Carolina
that's
well if this is South Carolina what's this one
North Carolina
remember
Kansas
Oklahoma
New Mexico
Arizona
Washington state
Oregon
does she know the names are written on there or does she think you know them all
oh she probably thinks I know xxx she probably thinks Mama's really smart
Honey do you think the words are written here or do you think Mommy's just super smart and knows all her states
you think I'm super smart
yeah
thanks Babes
xxx awesome
that's this is the potato state
Idaho potatoes
I do love potatoes
you know Mommy and Daddy went to Idaho once they went hot air ballooning
yeah
you know didn't Elmo go in a hot air balloon when you get in a little basket and it goes up up up up up
yeah
xxx I think you should try that you want me to show you pictures of it I have pictures of it when we went
okay let me find the pictures
it was very fun Mommy thought it was more fun than Daddy
but you know
you know it was really because I'm not like I never go on rollercoaster rides or anything like that
um I don't like drops and you know like but it's so gradual like going up and across and down and you just feel like
in a balloon
well you just feel like I guess the physics of it because like the heat rises and whatever that it's so simple that unless like you know some flying knife comes out and hits your balloon like that there's just not that much that can go assuming you're not because they do weather reporting so you're not gonna get hopefully caught in a thunderstorm or whatever
yeah sure
yeah let's see
xxx Daddy was saying we should take you to this place one day
it's called um Yellowstone and they have all this bubbling
oh I went there when I was a kid
so cool
they have all this bubbling mud that they call the paint pots and it just sits in the ground and bubbles really it's hot
and it makes noises and it's smelly
the sulfur is smelly
well because it's um sulfur smells like rotten eggs
and look and so acidic it burned a hole right through the street
look there's Daddy he's saying P U it smells
see
and look a buffalo
yeah
um because it's too hot
look there's the basket for the hot air balloon see
that's what I was thinking too the whole time I was there why can't I go in this stuff
right I think because
like there was something about it
yeah I think
you can go in some of them can't you like hot springs
oh hot springs you can but those are all like a hundred and five to a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit
and I think um like when we went to Yellowstone they said someone actually some kid wandered off into Old Faithful or something and it set off
yeah
see look here's the hot air balloon and they're gonna blow it up
there's the fire
and they're gonna blow up the balloon see the fire's going straight into the balloon
and that's what it looks like when we were inside the basket
and they blew up two big balloons
and then this is us from the sky we were in the basket and that was the other balloon down below
so Idaho not so exciting
I mean xxx
xxx looking
xxx exactly xxx
so there we were
oh that's cute
in the basket
neat huh
that was before you were born
back in the days when Mommy and Daddy used to do stuff
now we play with you
yeah
little yogurt nose
you're getting yogurt all over you
she's gonna be four not that far from now right
yeah on January thirteenth
are you gonna be four soon
that's really intense
she doesn't seem four
xxx I know
I mean she's small she's a small girl
yeah and the funny thing is
not that she's very mature you know it's not that
she seems xxx I remember because she talked fairly early
yeah
I mean she you could hold a conversation with her fairly early so
yeah she's one of the faster of the kids
yeah
and uh which I'm sure like well no I guess that's not true I was gonna say about all the faster ones are girls but maybe not
there well two
because she had this
two of the two out of three are girls
yeah
there was that little boy Evan that we actually met and he was
Evan is
talking way before she was
yeah Evan is an amazing speaker but he's a strange speaker
he's a strange speaker
yeah he's very sing+songy
oh that's interesting
so we're all curious to see what happens
oh that's interesting
now do they does he have a sibling now or he's still an only child
he's an only child
yeah
oh that's interesting
and his parents are very very she's a lawyer and he's a psychiatrist I think or something
yeah yeah
what Sweetie
needless to say we didn't continue videotaping him
why
too busy I mean they were xxx
oh they were too busy did she go back to work because she was home for xxx
I think she did
oh
she yeah
so
I'm actually going to see them this afternoon
oh no kidding

okay I'm looking
I'm looking to see uh
I know you do Honey
that's fine
or do you wanna do one like this
where we dunk them in chocolate
let's find those
do you want like this kind where we dunk them in chocolate
or we could also do
this kind where we fill them with chocolate
or we could do chocolate hearts with vanilla frosting
vanilla hearts with chocolate frosting
or we could do this kind of hearts dunked in chocolate
xxx what are you moaning about
okay well what kind would you like
that is a heart
yeah but don't you see that that's a heart shape right there
you wanna start to make them now
okay well first we have_to decide which cookies we're making and then we can start ot make them okay
okay do you wanna make this kind
this one we can make we can use our heart cookie cutter for this one if you want
can roll out the dough and cut hearts out with our cookie cutter and then put chocolate frosting in between them would you like to do that
yeah we hafta make the dough and this one we roll the dough out
you can still taste the dough
Babes
you know what
this is no reason to crack up
because we're making cookies and that's fun
or we could do this type of cookie
we could do xxx this kind of chocolate cookie with chocolate and raisins in them
you don't like raisins in your cookies
no
you have something in common with Daddy he doesn't like raisins in his cookies either
what do you think of that
well we could do it with chocolate chips but no raisins
if you'd prefer you wanna just do chocolate cookies with chocolate chips
what
just to eat
yeah
well once we make them
yeah
yeah
xxx but you hafta choose what kind you wanna make first
and I would like you to choose preferably without whining
okay
so do you like these kind of sandwich cookies that have frosting in between them or do you just wanna do chocolate cookies like this
you wanna do chocolate hearts with vanilla frosting
or would you like to do vanilla hearts with chocolate frosting
this kind huh
um I'm fine doing either
they both look good
well I think I might like these a little bit better with chocolate frosting

it's very tickly
I don't think it's going to
or do you wanna do these chocolate hearts Babes
those look pretty don't they
well we don't have_to put the sugar we can just do the chocolate with no sugar on them
those are beautiful aren't they
those are puffy and chocolate and meringuey
what do you think should we make those beautiful cookies
yeah
alright
let me just see
sure we can do chocolate with vanilla let's do chocolate with vanilla since that seems to be your preference
okay
um oh now let me give you fair warning on these though
for this one you have_to make the dough but then we're gonna hafta because we hafta roll them out it has to be hard so we hafta put it in the refrigerator and just let it sit so it takes a long time to cook these kinda cookies as opposed to the other kind
you still wanna make them
or do you wanna make a quicker cookie
okay so quicker ones we could either do
these hearts you definitely want hearts
yeah
um well but these take a long time to make because we hafta put them into the refrigerator
which is fine I don't mind doing that
um it those take a long time too Sweetie Pie so
yeah
anything
yeah
do you mind you don't mind waiting
a long time
alright so you pick a cookie out Sweetie
okay
it okay
okay
it's still gonna take anything that's heart shaped takes a while though to make because we have_to put it in the refrigerator to chill
um let me just see
I know then how about we don't make heart shaped cookies because anything we hafta cut out with cookie cutters
okay but that's why it takes a long time to make them Baby Cakes
what about if we do something interesting like this
chocolate
I didn't even tell you what we were doing yet
what if we do chocolate dough with white chocolate chips or something
like this kinda cookie
alright Lily Mommy's not gonna make cookies with you at all if all you're gonna do is moan
then why don't we do these Honey because these we don't have_to wait for we can make them right away
let me show you
these chocolate ones and we'll just do chocolate chips no raisins

you could also put other things on your pizza that you might like like olives

that's right they all live in New_York
do you know where Grandma xxx told me that she and Papa xxx were going
they're going to Greece
yeah that'd be fun it's very far away
you wanna go with me one day
okay they're going to a wedding
exciting hah
my name is Becky and I live near the New_York public library
some buildings in New_York make you feel small
but walking up the steps of the library makes me feel important
we should go to the library next time we're in
wouldn't that be a great idea
it's like walking up the steps of a palace especially if you walk exactly in the middle
xxx all the people
the library was my favorite place in New_York when we first moved here
my mother painted me a map
you can see it in the front of this book
here it is
she's an artist and she painted all the other pictures too
she said that once a week we could go wherever I wanted to
if I could figure out how to get there
for my first expedition I wanted to see real animals
finding a zoo on the map was easy
knowing where I was on the map and which way to walk to the zoo was a little harder
but I finally figured it out by turning the map
once the map and I were both facing the same direction finding the zoo was easy
have you been to the zoo
yes you have
one good thing about New_York is that most of the streets are numbered in order
the numbers go up as you go north and down as you go south
it's very logical
so we just walked straight on fifth avenue
I know I was going the right way because the numbers kept going up
and at sixty fourth street we turned left
sometimes zoos make you feel sorry for the animals that live in them but at this one most of the animals aren't in cages
the penguins have rocks to climb on and make their nests with and a pool to swim in
you can stand right next to the glass and see under the water
they were my favorites but I also liked watching the insects
I saw a leaf cutter ant bite off a leaf and carry it all the way back to its nest
what was your favorite thing at the zoo do you remember
yeah do you remember the polar bears
wasn't there a polar bear named Lily
that's pretty neat huh
yeah
tell me if you want me to take your plate okay
do you want me to take it
no
