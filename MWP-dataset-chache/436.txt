or just
no two sisters and they had to have everything the same
wow oh_my_goodness

mhm
mhm that's what it is
it's a big house
just like you have in New_Jersey now
what's the door I mean where does it go

oh it looks like it just goes into a closet
maybe we can look on the box and see where it's supposed to go
it's supposed to go right there let me see
open the house up all the way
let's see first open it's supposed to go right here somewhere
let's see somewhere right maybe just right there
then we can go up to the bed+room
is that a bath+room

no what does it do for the fireplace
I think it's broken honey
do you know why it's there
to protect you
that's a screen she's talking about
mhm
so the fire won't come out
so the logs won't roll out on the floor
because that's why the screen's there
the screen uhhuh
well that's supposed to open it but it's broken
yeah
mhm
so you can put more logs in and clean it out when it needs to be cleaned
I don't know

mhm
honey

Winnie_the_Poh likes honey

the roof wasn't wide enough
was he scared

I see
he went up and fixed it
mhm
it's easy to stand the cow up
it's pretty easy to stand the cow up
mhm
mhm
what
mhm
you didn't stand it up
you said you could stand up the baby cow but you didn't let it stand up
it fell down
what is it
mm
oh

on top of the newspaper so it will be out_of the way
a chicken

and take a rest
right here

how about right here
for who
for mommy
that's for the kitchen isn't it
in the kitchen
she just went to the bath+room
I was just putting some plates away
where did you where did the kitchen go over here
oh just so it would be in the middle
it does make noise when you get too close to it
okay
that's the bed+room and that's the kitchen
oh wait a minute
I thought you put the refrigerator over there
how can that be the kitchen if this
okay
now it's that's going to be the kitchen huh
that can be one bed+room and that
this is a bed+room over here in this corner
mhm
mhm
mhm
mm
did that scrape
did that scrape
mm I hit it scraped
let's see
is it going to turn red
oh I think it's alright
I thought it could go in the kitchen
I think that goes in the kitchen for the kitchen table
no it's the seat for the kitchen table
it could go besides it's a bench for the kitchen table
okay
that little tiny room is the living room
hm
mhm
well I think that the smallest room ought_to be the bath+room
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
uhhuh
mhm
is it in the bag
that's where all the furniture is as far as I know
is it empty
maybe we didn't bring the toilet then
I guess we didn't bring it
where does what belong
the wrench
it's the wrong way
the what out
um
I don't think that comes out
I just don't think it does
I think it's part of it's attached to the rest of the body of the car
I think only the sides come off
I think you're going the wrong way though
it's making it tighter
do you want to take it off or put it on
well
what do you want to do
do you want to take it off
that way
okay
yeah
I think I can help you a little bit maybe
nope
there
mhm
yes it does
the hood comes off
I think it can
mhm
nope
uhhuh
it's stuck
mm
you're going the wrong way
that's right
nope
that's right
maybe you need to use the screwdriver
yeah
now ya can't drive it all
no
because there's no wheels and there's no steering wheel
and
there's still a motor
there's still an engine
mhm
use the wrench
mhm
mhm
what
what
mhm
nope
now you can't drive at all
well you tell me
mhm
there's no engine and no steering wheel
you're the right person
why are you the right person to do it
why
because you are
it doesn't come out
is Jenni the right person
is Jenni the right person to do that too
why not
oh
she doesn't listen to you
oh
oh you're right
where did that come from
found the blue block
oh good
I'm so glad
wonder where it was
oh
maybe it was in the car or something
or maybe it was under the tractor
maybe so
no you didn't
you didn't lift it up
it was just sitting right there
oh you have a hole in both socks
oh
do you have a hole in both socks
who's going to put the car back together
who
who's going to put it back together
no
we're not leaving
I just wondered if you knew how to put it back together
because when you were little you didn't know how
can you do it now
who
can you
mm
I still see something else
and I don't hear it but I see it
is it under
have another bolt
and another one
is that it
I don't hear anything
I think you took it all apart
do you need help
oh
okay
good
that's a cute question
I don't know
I think it goes in on the spare tire
I think so
that goes on the engine
that goes on the steering wheel
mhm
that's not going to work
xxx screw
I think you have_to have a bolt on the back of it
no you don't
no you don't on this one
uhuh
maybe Lois will play with the steering wheel while you turn the screw
okay you turn the screw
the other way
the other way
whoop
nope
let's try it again
yeah
that's it
there
can or can't
mhm
uhuh
that's the engine
no
goes on the um
in the front
no
oh I'm sorry
that goes in the back
the engine goes in the front
no
that's right
nah that's not right
the engine just goes right here
doesn't have a wheel
this is the engine
no
you saw a wheel in the back
that's it
good
mhm
can I ask a question
mhm
okay we have_to write them after every step
what
after every step
uhhuh
you need a red screw Pete
yeah
yeah
that yellow one's too small
the other way
you can use a screwdriver if you want to make it tight
mm now it's tight
mm now it's tight
hm
that goes where it was
mhm
mhm
um
I think the tools go on the back
I think this goes in the back
I think so
the jack
I don't know
here it is
here it is
mhm
well I guess you need the wooden sides on first I think
I think so
put the hood on
yeah
you have_to put the hood on
here before you put the sides on
here it is
mhm
that's right
you want me to hold the car
that's the wrong side
Patsy said that's the wrong side
no we need the other one
this is a hard job isn't it
um no
that one goes right there I think
should we put a blue bolt in here too
let's put the bolt in first
okay
you have_to make these things fit those things in the holes I think
yeah
there you go
now you can screw it in
now you can screw it
there you go
now you can screw it in
now you can screw it
right here
okay
that's good
yeah
nice and tight
so okay
now if you put the other wooden side on you can put the wheels on
mhm
we have_to get this in the holes
okay
there
alright
the yellow screw
the blue bolt on the yellow screw
mm
I don't see one yellow screw
good for you
not talking about lumps here's a blue bolt
where's the yellow screw
do you see
oh it's behind you Peter
there it is right there
we have_to fit the blue
wait a minute
take the screw out
have_to put the bolt on first
okay
that's probably tight enough
little bit more
okay
very good
it's nice and tight now
now there's the wheels and the headlights
okay
put the little bolt inside
wait Peter
we have_to put a bolt in first
okay
whoops
oh I pulled my hair a little bit but it's alright
it didn't hurt very much
mhm
looking at the screw to see if it goes in the bolt okay and I don't think it does
I think I have a bolt that's too small
I do okay
can you take the screw out again
I'm sorry
I made a mistake
okay
now it should be okay
mm
it's working
that's a good idea
oh you did a good job so far
it's a_lot_of work
I didn't know you knew how to put it back together
why does it have tools
so_that you can fix the xxx
so_that you can take it apart and put it back together
if you didn't have the tools you couldn't unscrew the wheels if you didn't have a screwdriver
mhm
mhm
if you have a jack it's easier to change the tires
mhm
you can take the bolts out
mhm
mhm
it would be very hard to do it if you didn't have on of those
I think you probably could do it but it would hurt
you could put the rest of the wheels on
I don't know
what is that
a little car
I don't know
mhm
is this a tool
is this a tool
is this a tool
hm
mhm
you want me to help you
should we put a tire on
okay
you give that
that's a bolt
okay
you look and watch the screw come through
is it coming through yet
okay
okay
should we put another one on now
this one
I see the screw coming through
okay
mhm
got one more huh
I need another bolt though another yellow bolt
yeah
the screw coming through
okay
I see it coming through
good
now I think we're missing the headlights
right here
no
that's the windshield
mhm
it's supposed to be a window
it's pretend window
those are the headlights and the taillights
the other one is behind you
mhm
you have_to put the screws in to make it look like headlights though
mhm
I think it's a combination of the headlights and bumper I guess
do you think we have_to put some bolts in or not
mhm
yeah
we have_to open the trunk
oh there is a yellow one in there already
I don't think the blue goes there
that's right
mhm
I'll hold this on for you if you want and you put the screw in
no no that's not gonna work
mhm
mhm
mhm
right
I'm sure we have_to push it from the back
yeah
how about this uh taillight
it already has a bolt
that's right
here's your screw
there's another blue screw behind you
let's see now
it's almost done
I'm very surprised that you could do the whole thing
because when you were a little bitty boy when you were just a little boy
you couldn't put the car back together
did you know that
you need to put a bolt in first
it was just
here it is
time out
you have_to put the bolt in
I see it coming maybe it's under your valentine
there it is
I see it coming
see
here it is
whew
very good
that was good
all finished
congratulations
you win first prize
well I don't think we brought the other barrels
what do you mean
do you want to fix up all the rooms
okay
what what kind of things
we didn't bring all the furniture because we had to come so far
you know we had to come a long way today
so we didn't bring all the furniture
we can make we can fix each room
because we had so far to come that's why we didn't bring you then
but we can fix up each room a little bit
maybe the next time we come but we won't be coming tomorrow
because we just are going to come one time this time instead of two times
because it's so far
it's a long trip
I know but
well we have_to come on the bus
before we used to just walk to your house from school
mhm
mhm
because we live in New_York and you still we still live in New_York and you live in New_Jersey
mhm
we have_to go all the way back to where your daddy works
oh it's much too far
yeah
it's about an hour
it takes about an hour
that's right
and then we can walk to our house from there
okay
let's see
we could make this the living room
the whole family in the living room
and we could put this in the living room
this bench
and maybe we could put one of these chests in the living room too
and we could even take some of the furniture from that house and put it in this on
we could get the table and put it in here
there's only one table
you know we could get that round one in there and there'd be two tables
why don't you put that one in this room
so there'll be one in each room instead of having all in the same room
not big enough
mm
okay
oh not too long
well pretty soon we have_to go home
I have_to go and see my Lucy
you know my I have_to go see my baby too
because she'll be hungry and want somebody to be home
well I was going to put these in the house
no
I'm not we're not going yet
I was just going to put them in
oh maybe this goes like this
well maybe that's maybe that's the way it goes
maybe
they're sitting in the kitchen
this is Jenni's going to take a nap
oh is that Peter
and daddy's going to sit in this room and the dog is going to go in the kitchen with mommy and and Peter or is that mommy and Jenni
and these chairs can go in this room
here
mm
what got cleaned up
what got cleaned up
uhhuh
all the rooms got cleaned up huh
oh you mean this room
this big room
oh we didn't finish
because we didn't have enough furniture
okay
mhm
oh anything
if you want to you can pretend this is a table if you want to a round table
since we didn't have another table you can put that one in there
yeah
that's a little table
if you want to
mhm
mhm
mhm
what
where
I thought it was Peter
I thought that was the little bag
mhm
he's sitting in his room
he's reading
he's reading a book
I'm just pretending
no
oh yes the humidifier
the humidifier
the humidifier
is it the that thing you showed us upstairs that blows out wind
isn't that a humidifier
that thing that's blowing up there
I do
goes sss like that
oh I see
oh
I see
we could blow up a balloon with it
what
I'm lining up the animals for a parade
oh I didn't have anything else to do
I thought it was a pretty good idea
oops
they're going to march in a parade
want to put the baby cow in a in a line
it's behind you over there
at the end
here
where do you think they're going to go
are you going to make them march
up on the where
up on the wall
oh
boom
boom boom boom
oops
mm
they didn't get very far did they
maybe some of the people would like to ride them and then they could then they could go in a real parade
