natha n we turned the television on couple weeks ago there was saxophone music on

the oil keeps the car from
squeaking
squeaking
you know like our front the front door in our car
it goes squeak squeak every time we open it
what has_to happen is we have_to go oil it
so it won't squeak anymore
that's right
that's the door that needs to be oiled so it won't squeak anymore
that's a good idea
let's do that when we get home though

okay
this says
Place
Tom and Kitty sat in their places at the table
Mother placed the cake on the table
Squeaky
what's Squeaky doing
that's right
well we don't like mouses on top of our cakeses
because
will you get off the cake Squeaky and sit at the table if you want a piece of cake
because that's the proper way to eat cake
you sit at the table
not on the cake
I mean you don't sit on your yogurt when you wanna eat your yogurt do ya
right
you'd just make a big mess
tell Squeaky to get off there
and then let's turn the page
Nathaniel I think you're stuck on a page

who can goes fastest
do ya think
Baron Von Crow can go pretty fast too

Doodledoo went for a ride with Dingo

why
right
because Dingo is not a very good driver
what's Dingo doing right now
he's just about to drive off the
cliff
this is called a cliff
because he was going too fast
yeah
you go slower when you're driving around curves
you can't go so fast around curves
you can't steer your car
you'd just go right off the road
and if it's a cliff that's really bad because then you go off the whole mountain
he's a good Squeaky's a good driver
yep
when he gets around the curve he can go faster
you can go faster when it's straight than you can when it is curved
uhoh what's Dingo doing
what's he doing
he's
curving all over the street
you know what it says here
it says
Safe
it is not safe to play in the street
always play on the pavement or in your garden
why
why
why shouldn't you play in the street

what what's papa doing
that's mama
this is papa
what's papa doing
yes
why do you think mama has_to put the food on top of the tv
why
so they could eat

Danger
Blinky is sliding on the smooth ice
what'll happen if he goes over here where it says danger
he'll go right through
because that ice is thin over there
and when the ice is thin then you can go right through it
and fall into the wa cold cold water
the ice will break
because sometimes when it if it isn't hasn't been freezing very long
and the ice is too thin to walk on
which one
Spill
father spilled the milk
because he wasn't watching

what is Dingo trying to do
does he think he's a train
well what's de doing
get off those tracks Dingo
only trains allowed on railroad tracks
well you know Dingo
you just can't predict what he's gonna do
if there's something you shouldn't do with a car then Dingo will do it
I guess because he wanted to get over here and drive on the railroad tracks
he wanted to pretend he was a train
I don't know
who knows
Dingo knows that's right
all these lorries vans trailers buses are called transport because they carry things
Dingo has a new red racing car
