okay
okay
so this is cool these are all the wheels huh

would do you think could happen to them
right but what could happen when they fall
get lost okay what else
they can get dirty right can you think of anything else
ruined that's kind of what I was thinking that the ends could break off the parts that you draw with you know
yeah
do you want me to read the names of the colors they're kind of interesting names
they have kind of interesting names okay bring me the box please and we will put them back as we're done as we read them
okay this has a very interesting name it's called green
this one's called black
okay this one has a interesting name tickle me pig
see that's a cool name
white with confetti glitter that's a good name
gold red orange ah white red again yellow green hm interesting so green and yellow green let's see oh yeah there's a big difference there
which one do you think looks more like grass
yeah I think so too
you're gonna make a grass picture now
turquoise blue this is called razzmatazz this is very interesting wild purple with ruby gold with ruby red glitter that's on here
robins egg blue that's a very nice color
and then this is
robins egg blue it's the same color as a robins egg you know like a bird a robin it's the same color as the egg and this one's called blue green with glitzy gold glitter glitzy gold glitter whoa
glitzy gold glitter
that's a nice grass picture
purple what
oh great idea purple crickets I love that idea
so you've got grass and purple crickets
awesome idea this must be a summer picture right
I love it
I'm trying to think of what else we might have in the summer that you could put in your picture
a white house oh that white looks pretty good it works on the green paper very well
speaking of houses we were going up the stairs and Matty told me and this girl was there that the president was at our house right now remember that Boo you told her the president of the United States was at our house
so that's cool that's a white house so they lived by the
is this their lawn
oh it's our house very cool
okay it's gonna be a gold chimney
hm what color do you think smoke would be
gray oh there's a lot of smoke coming out of that chimney
you know another thing I'm a thinking about is Helga probably doesn't know where we are planning to go for the summer trip remember we went to get information on it
where are we going this summer
you don't like Disney World do you
wow what do you wanna go do over there
they have swimming pool at Disney World
really
wow
there's big water parks there now too
also they have a park a place called Magic Kingdom right where they have castle
and all the Disney characters
and roller coasters
huh
oops that's gross don't do that please
what else did you add to your summer picture you've got a chimney and a house and smoke coming out of the chimney and we got grass with crickets what else
anything else you can think of for the house or for the picture
hum I don't think we have a brown
are those what
because otherwise how can you see out right
so is this I wondered is this since this was our house is this the door or is this your big playroom window
okay
that's the door to go outside in the backyard or the front yard
hum xxx
well we love the summer we do so many cool things in the summer
remember we usually go we what we're going to Disney World we haven't gone there before but we usually go to the beach right in the summer
what else do we do in the summer
you forget
sometimes we go to the library
and we go to you have a certain game that you play where you kick a ball
you play soccer yeah
now I hope that we can sign you up for soccer I don't remember I'm worried it might have already been the sign up time honey it might be too late
we need to call remember when how about when we get home remind me and I'll call missus Eves and ask her okay
since I'm kind afraid we kind of missed it maybe that would be too bad huh
because you wanna play again right
Matty last year was so close to getting a goal
remember that
oh
it was so close though
but at least the other boy got it right so your team got a point yeah
thank you this is awesome look at there's two pictures I like them very much
are they gonna be are we going to take them home or is she get to keep them
you're gonna take them home
oh_my_goodness
oh that's a little bit messy
hey you know what this green reminds me of something that was yesterday
oh no
what was the holiday that was yesterday
it is
you've been teaching me all about saint Patrick because I did not know very much about him
what happened to saint Patrick
you forget
whoa
oops oh my after we're done with this we can play that game
the problem with that game is that it's so loud you know
so what did you tell me about saint Patrick didn't he wasn't he a slave for a while or something what happened
well what did he do that was good though
he snuck away yeah that's true
what did he do with the people in Ireland
you don't remember what he did with the people in Ireland
did he poke them
what did he tell them about
uh hm
uh you can do it something like this
here tell doctor Weist and Helga about these things
uh hm so he helped them to learn that right
oops yeah that crayon's broken
so that was pretty cool huh so they learned that
then the people in Ireland knew that they could understand
I know you want more of this crayon you wanna use the bigger part
oh yeah
color on the back of the blue okay go ahead
oh cool so that's how it looks right
it's like a mouse
okay well you try again then so if you like it try to do try to do it again then
it kind of does
here here let me make it into the mouse you ready
here's his eyes here's his whiskers is that what you're thinking
here's his nose here's his smile here's a mouse yeah
okay so that's what
what part is that
okay the stem and then
alright that's more how it is right
cool that is a very nice shamrock
so everybody in your whole school pretty much wore green yesterday didn't they
you wanna work on the mouse some more
he is very cute
lets see here
oh is that his bigger eye
yeah
you like to draw you know xxx last yeah he didn't like to draw but now he really does don't you draw like every day pretty much
and you write lots_of letters
you did not know this but guess what week it is for letters
you know I said she did not know you gotta tell her
what week it is for letters at your school
can I see if you know how to make one
yeah you know how to
big w
oh my
now you know what that looks like
I'll show you ready don't be scared
what's that
uh huh a mean bird
you didn't know that a mean bird had a w in it right
nobody erased it
do you remember what it says
huh
right remember what the picture is of
it says this is a wire Matty
cool
yep and nobody did did they
ah sure
you wanna do them but be real careful don't drop them on the floor okay we don't want them to break
is it going
yeah that one is but this one not
oh these are cool look at the paper that Helga brought isn't that cool
I wonder where that where'd that blue paper come from
it came from the closet over there
it's cool
what's on the other side oop blank
it's not blue it's blank
I think somebody had a project they were doing and these are the leftovers
pretty cool
so what were we doing this afternoon before we came
watching tv what did you watch
uh hm what was mommy doing
mommy was taking a nap yeah
so I was thinking we should tell we haven't seen Helga in a couple weeks she doesn't know the different places that we've been since we saw her
we went to
Niagara Falls
what'd we do at Niagara_Falls
yeah yeah we walked around and looked at stuff that's true
well you got something there that you liked very much and remember we kept consulting you what'd you pick up there that you kept looking at
well how'd we know where we were going
so what was it
um hm
wow
whole Niagara Falls yep so we saw one part and then we walked and then we went all over it
um hm
we also did something else we never did before do you remember where we climbed
hum we climbed to the tower remember how we kind of climbed up to the higher part kind of like an observation tower and we saw over the falls
um hm
oh that's the one you were talking about yeah
so we did that and then the weekend before which was right after we saw Helga the last time we went to Pittsburgh
and what'd you do there
did you swim
tell her about the big cool swimming pool
oh cool
um hm and you'd end up outside
uh hm
it was very interesting so we went swimming and then what else did we see the next day
dinosaurs yep at the dinosaur museum
there was some kind of interesting part about by where they had the dinosaurs what'd you get to do
did you dig or you totally don't remember
they had a site where you could dig for dinosaur bones but only kids were allowed right
and what kind of tools did you need in order to dig
your hands
no
one was like a little chisel and then
and then what'd you do
that was really very cool
and then that part was cool and then try to think about what else was interesting about that dinosaur museum do you remember anything else that was kind of cool in there
did they have tiny tiny dinosaurs
giant dinosaurs
they were they had a close relative of like a Brachiosaurus remember how long that was and remember how we counted it out
yes
what else was the coolest coolest dinosaur there
where there any meat eaters
didn't they have a tyran
Tyranasauraus_Rex yeah that was very very cool
see it seems like almost a long time ago since we went that was only about a week or two ago but I don't remember our trip very well either hum
well that doesn't show up now does it
so what else have we been doing
oh maybe we should her what happened to daddy and how you had to help daddy
um hm
you helped him put his socks on
no
how did you help him when he got home from work
um hm
um hm he and his daddy just laid down from the people you know he didn't expect his daddy to play like games with him or anything right you guys just laid on the couch
yeah and how did we set up the couch so it would be very comfortable
um hm we set up the pillows and the hot um heating pad right
you know what I think he's feeling better today
what were you thinking when you were just downstairs with him now
um hm yeah he seemed to be doing better
so I didn't get to hear much about the musical today at school
what was it for
oh can't really say all of them because there's a bunch
remember Sarah thought that she was gonna supposed to sing in it
she wasn't right
maybe Sarah has older brothers and sisters that are gonna be in it an she got confused or something you know I don't know
oh so he wasn't in the play right
oh that's so funny
so I'm trying to think of what else we did
oh you and your dad went to the land on Saturday oh_my_goodness
doctor Weist would love to hear about what you did on the land
you don't remember much
it's just so funny you can't even say it okay well ah I'll just give a hint it has to do with the word mud
you do remember it
okay well I was at work grading a paper so I do not know but it seems to me that he and Jason had a giant mud fight
oh my what's up with him he looks really weird hum
so they they came home and weren't you full of mud
daddy said he couldn't even see your clothes you had so much mud on you
you're almost done you just have_to color that
so
we have a bunch of plans actually for coming up this weekend whose birthday party is you is it on Saturday
yeah and what do we know about his party
well its gonna be a
where's it gonna be
let's talk about that
no actually it's it's at the it's at the just my imagination workshop remember
that's weird Helga what happened
I dunno it's still going
it's like it stopped
yeah I know hum
it's still going
okay you wanna check it just push stop or something
yeah I could do it
well just because you don't want to do it if it is not recording or something
oh I sound so young I hate my voice on tape haha
you'd rather sound old
yeah
is it still going now okay
so Matty what happened over there
you dropped it on that button and then all the money came out okay well thank you picking it up thank you very much
so anyway Max is supposed to have an army party
but I am not sure that Matty should go
but what happens what might you get as a present
well maybe ah maybe we should just give it to a different kid
no
I dunno why he likes the army stuff though
I saw him wearing a little army outfit again today
I wondered if maybe his dad used to be in the army sometimes if you had your dad or something in the army or your mom then you don't think army stuff is bad I dunno
well yeah it's bad if people die right I think then it's bad
you're alright
so anyway then actually you know you might be very surprised to hear this but next week actually for two weeks what's gonna be different about Matty
instead of going to N C C as in every day what is Matty gonna to be doing
for two weeks
well do you have school
two weeks
that's a long time
um hm it's gonna be hard to get him to go back I think afterwards
because you're going to be so used to being home
because you know who's coming to visit the second week
uh hm
do you want something in that cabinet
okay
what would you like to do
let's see if there's something interesting in there
hum you want these
do you wanna play dinosaur game where we buy the dinosaurs

ring ring ring
hi sorry to bother you again the dinosaurs are working out pretty good they seem to be getting along and you were right that the other one keeps them quiet
but I'm having some other troubles now
well you never told me how to get them to use a toilet
they pee in what
old bottle cans
I don't have any of those
keep what
oh you just put them you just have them pee in the old containers
and then what'd I do with their food
I see
but will they know to use the toilet and will they know to use the bottles and the containers and all that

alright thank you very much
okay let's say it's like two weeks later
I call you up

ring ring ring hello
I thought you were going to take the three dinosaurs but now you left me a new one and now I have four
well it's sort of a problem because you know how I told you my house was messy before
but now it's worse because he's a meat eater and he keeps chasing the other ones
can you please come back
thank you
yes why don't you take them all here
they gotta stay here
ring ring ring
hello
I have a new idea
I just feel like that they wanna be free
I'm gonna just let them live outside okay
okay goodbye
we're free we're free
don't you think they should live outside instead of in the house
alright
don't you know of like a zoo or anywhere where I could keep them because I guess I don't really want them to be hit by a car or anything
is that your new pacifier now
you're a baby
yeah
this is your favorite zoo
this looks good see look at all the green see they have plenty of places to live and hang out this looks like a better place it's actually looks like the Great Valley
is it the Great Valley
no
wait take that out of you mouth honey okay go ahead
remember what
oh yeah we were playing xxx or something right
you always put the baby inside in here
I remember that
please hold xxx Momma Momma
is there another baby underneath
oh good question let's see if there's a baby in the lower container too
no
just just nothing
this too just until the baby starts eating right
stack it along
wow
how is the baby gonna get out
oh it's gotta wait to wait its gotta wait to grow up in order to get out
oh
um I don't know what to tell you Matty this doesn't seem like it is going to be too stable
don't forget your pacifier
oh my gosh
what is this thing supposed to be you think
what's this part of the bathtub
ah you're totally right
they're ready oh
I've been thinking about you didn't tell me about how kids did at school today did anybody end up with a yellow stick
ah you
oh okay what happened
Brian xxx of computer A what did he do
how do you know you weren't even there
oh you overheard her talking to misses Bonny about what happened
she was talking about punching
hey Matty you know what
can you come back here please
because we can't hear it it's a lot it's too loud on the floor
thank you
that's going pretty fast
so that's what happened to Brian did anything else happen to any other kids at school
no the other kids had a good day
uh hum
there was one time that Matty got a yellow stick
you were running around I thought it's because you were wrestling
that was yesterday
no when was that
like a long time ago right
like maybe September or October or something like that
he always did a good job at school
you know what oh I know something you did that you did not tell her about that we never did xxx that you went to play you played with Casey the other day remember when you went to Casey's house
what
why do you keep dropping everything down there
you have_to put them all back in you know
I'll help you but let's talk about Casey like what'd you do with Casey that you were so excited about and you didn't want it to end
you drove around and were you driving in each other's cars
so what kind of car does he have
a jeep
you just had a regular car
oh wait don't pick that that xxx right
why are you playing xxx
okay
can we open this that would be nice
otherwise we just have_to find xxx
oh there should be one around
xxx yeah we are making a mess we don't usually do that right
no so that should make us xxx
this is not xxx a house but building your own when you have your own family
this is nice and comfortable over there
yeah
that's what I was thinking where's your wife gonna go or where's your kids gonna go
oh the bed where you can sit
the bed's too big
what are you making
ahhah so that looks like this is the roof right
well I'm trying to think what was the last time we saw Helga it was just before oh I think it was just before Easter right
do you wanna tell her some of the different things you've been doing
I don't know what you've been doing oh_my_goodness how about I'll give you a hint aquarium
what'd you say about going to the aquarium
what'd you say about going to the aquarium
wow did you go swim with them
what were they doing
hum what were the great whites doing
swimming
what else did you and daddy do while you were there
you got something that you kind of like
at the aquarium
you remember
teeth were they real
how how'd you get that
oh you didn't take it out of his mouth
that would be scary
so yep they have them and where they recent ones or were they from long time ago you think xxx
um hm they were fossilized so they seemed to be alright
ah so then what did you like during the time when grandma and grandpa were here
you forget
well remember this is when I was on my trip right
one day you told me about driving
driving from where to where um I don't know you told me you drove the whole day all day long
you like the marker
so maybe we should talk about something because you are not really remembering those days how about won't you tell her about the new game we've been playing it's a super fun game at our house
hum
watch this ah is it going through
you know that's actually not so good for the marker
because it can mush the tops see and it might not work anymore
you think it will still work hopefully
so
you made three
orange
I can't believe you're not going to tell her about the very cool game we've been playing at home the one you did not want to stop playing that you wanted to play when we get home tonight
I have_to pretend to cook him so how do we play it what'd you need in order to play the game
okay and
yeah and what else
what did I just what did I pretend to sprinkle on you xxx
xxx onions
okay so what kinds of things did I pretend to cook you up to be
you forget really
yeah
look how big of a dog that is yeah that is a big one
it's yellow I think
and this is yellow but it kind of looks orangie in the middle doesn't it
interesting
now that's definitely yellow
so what did we what's our plan with this she is probably wondering why we brought this
to get a snack okay
is there money in there
that's a lot of money in there are you gonna buy the whole machine
it looks like looks like something
you recognized it
yeah
the silly purse
actually Matty do you remember what was in this when we bought it
a deck of cards
you remember
oh wow there's quite a lot of money in here
wow
this one's not going to be very helpful for the machine though
how come
it's Canadian
I know there were only three did it go under the table you think
well at some point
um well you know you were telling me yesterday about some of the things with the magic show maybe Helga would like to hear about the magic show you set up
can I put that one in hum
wow
a bunch of toilet paper came out of his mouth that was very interesting
it came out the color whichever colors you threw
and then what happened
see that is interesting
what about the animals you said something interesting with animals too
do you remember
well I think it was something like there was a lion and it turned into a snake
okay
a bird turned into a ferret
I know a bird turned into a ferret isn't that what you just said
yeah I don't know how that could happen hm
so that was interesting thing that happened he didn't go to school though for two weeks
wow that's a lot of them
the first week was kind of interesting because I was at work daddy was at work and who watched you all week
what'd you actually do with Lisa
I know one thing you did
went to the picnic
picnic in the living room how'd you have picnic in the living room
invite some of your animal friends to come
yeah I know those are kind of a wet markers aren't they
that's why you're only using one at a time because it'd be a huge huge mess
wow
you know we had kind of a weird this weekend because we kept trying to do different things remember Matty and like everything kept getting changed like remember first we were going to go to Splash Lagoon but what happened
right so we couldn't go to Splash Lagoon there was no room and then we were gonna go to this children's festival thing but then what happened
do you remember when we went
um hm it was already over by the time we got there
oh my that's quite a splattering
uh hum
so we didn't get to go to that what did we end up doing
hm remember Roman Roman
let's see oh my gosh that's a total splattering I think you're doing this kind of full of marker though
yeah because look at it's flying everywhere it's getting all over the table it's getting it on me you're getting it on Helga
let's not splatter them quite so much now okay
yeah not so hard
yeah that would be the way not to do it
okay
what happens when I say not to do something and if you do do it what happens
time out or
bed early so let's not splatter anymore okay
it totally looks like paint
well you know the same stuff that's in markers is just basically paint right
it looks like you're painting your hands pretty well
so I'm trying to think of what else
look at it's so many
only three three big splatters
and then some other stuff too this is like a little kind of a little splatter one
this is a little splatter one
I don't want you to do them
so maybe you could talk about what you got for Easter you got a lot of presents for Easter I am very
oh yeah you did that's Helga's
so what'd you get for Easter hum
oh you're splattering uh oh
please don't do that I already asked you not to do that
I think we're going to have_to have a rescheduling we're going to need to come back a different day
because you're not following the rules
okay we're going to come back and we'll do this next week
now we will have_to go home and go to bed early because you were not listening when I told you not to do that
what do we usually do when we're in here
hm well the markers are not working out so well though you're having a hard time listening with the markers
you'll try crayons
okay
crayons are better because they can't splatter like markers
okay so maybe you know I also didn't really like it when you threw the markers all over the table how do you think we can deal with the markers now
okay and then
you had a better idea in terms of crayons right
okay so we'll put these away can you please get them from the table
I said we're gonna talk about it when we leave here
okay please give these to her
thank you
I wonder if Helga noticed your new shoes
do you want to describe them to doctor Weist because he will can never see them so what would you talk about your shoes
you don't know
no I feel like if you are going to be here you need to try to do a good job and talk like you always do about the same things
otherwise we might as well just go
you do
do you wanna try to come back next week and we will do it again
I think that would be better okay
okay
remember that day and I was angry because it was like splashing everywhere
oh yeah I remember that
it's been quite some time since we've been here huh
do you wanna play the selling game or do you wanna
the dinosaur selling game for old times sake
that used to be your favorite game let's see if I can find the dinosaurs hm oh here's some
we still can play our very favorite game
okay
yes
well I'm not sure which one would you recommend
you would suggest brontosaurus why would you suggest that one
um okay well do you sell plants
I don't have here hold on I don't have that many plants at my house
this has plants in it
okay are those like seeds to grow plants
that would be helpful
okay well how much does he cost
okay
you've got a deal
no you xxx want real money huh
yeah
oh you want me to get some real money from my purse pay you
but don't eat it
no
no
where were we just before we came here
where did we get this money
from the machine in the
yeah we just were at the library we had to make some copies
okay here's some money you play with but don't eat it and don't keep it
oh it's actually more than a dollar this is
you're gonna keep it all
well I suppose since I'm buying some plants too
okay thank you very much
I'll call you if there's any problems okay
did you ring them up
did you ring it up
how about how about the food thing
okay thank you
alright so this is my house
I know but that's kind of far away from the thing so I'm going to stay right here
that looks like a microphone hey like this that's when they're like could you please tell my how much this spaghetti sauce costs in isle five
that's what they use those little microphones for to call people at xxx up front of the store
okay ring ring ring
I have a problem
well my problem is that um you gave me just seeds you know
and my brontosaurus is hungry right now
you mean there's supposed to be seeds and plants in here
well there's just seeds
well how long does it take them to grow
uh but he's hungry right now he is starting to roar
one second oh okay okay I'll see how that works okay
um how do I grow the seeds what'd I need to mix in the bowl
just water okay
should I grow them in my bathtub
okay alright thank you bye

okay well is there anyway to get to kill the trees and I can start over again
oh okay good idea I'll come back and get some more seeds and I'll start over again okay bye
okay
I gotta pay for more seeds but it was your idea to put them in the bathtub
oh I see we had a misunderstanding I was just supposed to get water out of the bathtub
okay here's some more money if I can have some more seeds please
okay alright we'll see how this goes okay
now let's just say I filled up my whole backyard with these trees
oh yum can I I'll call you again
hello
this is working great now
great I just have a little wonder of a thing I'm wondering about
well I'm wondering about where he sleeps
he does
does he get cold at night
he just lays outside
I don't need any giant blankets
okay alright
um let's see um he's a little lonely
you got another brontosaurus for him
and they'll be friends
okay thanks
what
dinosaurs two they're getting
oh okay okay so you're announcing it to the store
ah um is is this the one should I buy him
oh that wouldn't be so good with my brontosaurus
okay I don't have any more money though I gave you all my money
ah cool alright I'll pay you then
one dollar is actually four quarters here's a dollar
okay anything I need to know that's important about him in order to take care of him
nothing in particular where does he sleep
really nothing I need to worry about
you sure
can't they get anything
alright thank you
um hm
you wanna keep at least one or two of those quarters
what're you going to buy with them
just keep them
you just wanna keep them in case you need money later
one or two we'll talk about it after we leave
okay
you are you pestering me
didn't I say we can talk about it when we leave
okay let me have two back
you want me to keep them all in there for the game
okay alright
so I was thinking maybe we could do something else besides besides this game because I wanted you to be able to tell Helga about your birthday and graduation and all these things so which one do you wanna start with birthday
okay tell her about your birthday
well his birthday
after the game oh but we won't have time
just gotta I just gotta just buy this last one
okay and then we'll talk about your birthday
two more quarters I gotta pay you more
all the money okay
alright we'll play this for just a few more minutes and then
oh_my_goodness you mean you're keeping that
you don't have any pockets though right
oh okay we'll see about that okay alright
so here are the triceratops home
and now they're meeting each other
they seem like they're getting along pretty well
hi my name is Joe my name is Joe too
they're both named Joe
I can't believe it amazing okay
yes except last night they kept me up
I don't know why I thought they were happy with the trees
with having um you know a nice place to sleep
but they were so loud
the neighbors complained
what would you recommend
you thought that what
so why were they loud
oh so maybe I should get a different kind of pet
really well how do other people deal with the noise
they don't the noise doesn't bother them
oh do you think I should move maybe
no no take them with me and we'll move out to the country where there's no people living by us so we won't bother anybody
okay
do you sell houses
do you sell new houses
okay because I think that would be good because my neighbors are really angry and they were just loud all night long
but you're right that's just how dinosaurs are
do you sell do you sell things to cover their mouths so they don't roar
okay okay so like this will this help
is that how I should do it and tie them on will that keep them quiet
hum that doesn't fit at all
hum maybe we could can he go in will it help if his mouth is inside this
ah it seems hopeless I think I'm gonna have_to move to the country I think that's a better idea because they're just gonna loud I think
uh hm
no you can't have all this money in fact I'm regretting that I let you use it because now you keep thinking about it
I'll tell you what you may have two quarters and I'll keep the rest okay
okay okay oh wait did you want to tell Helga about your

since it was your birthday
okay alright I'll tell her the details of the party
there was six children who came
ten actually
who came to your party
ten hundred
wow
infinity kids it felt like infinity kids at the house
we played we played this game it was called um kick the can
and then we played scrabble
well why don't you tell her about all the cool games
me okay
we played we played pin
pin the tail on the donkey
now you know what she's from Iceland so she doesn't even probably know how to play pin the tail on the donkey can we tell her how to play the game
how do you gotta do it
is it a real pig
a real donkey
no
oh okay
what'd you got_to do
a real tail
yes and how do you know do you just walk right up and put it right on there that doesn't sound very hard
what makes it tricky
yeah
because you had no idea where it was right
so you stuck it on the wall
that was cool
you know she probably wonders what food you had for your party too
oh you changed
oh what had he said he was gonna have
Jenny B Jones or something like that
oh Jenny B Jones party you had mentioned before
oh yeah we had care bears party and a and then also so besides pin the tail on the donkey we did a treasure hunt
uh hum
and then one other game what was the other thing we did that was fun
she probably doesn't know about a pinata either what's what'd you do with a pinata
you hit what
what I can't even hear a word you're saying
I can't even hear you why don't you speak out loud
why
it's hard to explain
that you hit well it was a rainbow and that's because it was care bears so it was rainbow shaped and then you used what
yeah and then what happens once you hit it and it falls
oh there's candy yummy
did you eat it all
other people scrambled to get all the candy that they can and they put it in a little bag right
and who ended up with the most candy
yeah you kept just grabbing it and he ended up with a bunch of it so
actually
did you eat it all
no he thought that was gonna happen
so he also gave some to some other children who couldn't come to the party on Saturday they come over to play Sunday he gave them some of his candy right Boo
wow wow wow now do you um on Tuesday we went to his graduation which was very cool you know you probably thought he was still in preschool but what Matty what's the truth now
you're in high school
in college
then what're you doing now
you're gonna go to school in the fall what kind of school
yes
ah what grade are you gonna be in

gymnastics but this one's going to be a special week because
yep teddy bear Olympics yes yes teddy bear Olympics
why do you whisper Boo
why're you whispering she has to hear it doctor Weist would like to hear it too
okay so that's some of our exciting things coming up and then you had your birthday party and I'm trying to think of what else was interesting about your party
you got some cool gifts for your birthday
what are you doing
I thought you were so excited about your video player you explained it totally to doctor Weist in the hallway so and I don't think Helga's ever seen one it is actually very interesting it's the first time I saw it the video player
what is that it's very cool
uh hum
and what do you do with it
but what's interesting about it
little ones
they're like this big
cute
they're very tiny and
now did that hurt your mouth too
okay let's not do that anymore because it snapped my mouth
um so the whole thing is like only like this big it's just a little tiny tiny video player
excuse me that was gross
okay so anyway where else um what else did you get for your birthday
yeah you chose it out but somebody gave it gave you money grandpa grandma grandma and grandpa Zevenburgen gave you a gift card and then you chose that out so you did get it for your birthday does that make sense
well they sent you the gift card for your birthday and then you chose it out so they really gave you that money actually
so
don't put it in your mouth
money is very dirty
what else did you get with your gift cards
how about at the Boulders
he's been reading a lot of books lately well he doesn't read them but he had we've been reading a lot of books to him right Boo
I know that looks scary right in my face ah ah
that looks scary
oh what were we doing at home that just reminded me of this sort of creature that does not quite have legs yet what're we
yeah
well tell her about them where'd we get them
okay and then
and that's all I needed to know
they're gonna be cool
um
we have a lot of pets now because how many pets do we have all together would you say
