I'm gonna show you
about the bicycles
have you ever seen a bicycle that looks like that
that would be funny wouldn't it
that would be kind of hard xxx because they've got all the things around the wheels and so makes it really look strange
those are just different kinds of bicycles and then see they've got these little shields and so_that helps make them to be able to go faster
and this has three wheels and the guy leans back and it's very little air resistance so it can go real fast
it can go faster than most bicycle can go
but it's hard
you have_to lie down and pedal
that would be really hard I think
and there's another one
see it's got that little shield and you're inside some plastic and that makes it easier to go a lot faster
that's a funny bike that's got a small wheel and a big wheel
it's not a wheelchair but he sure does look strange on it doesn't it
and he has uh that's just a funny looking bicycle
that's the same bicycle looked at from a different angle
and here's a very very small one
small front wheel
is this a small back wheel
or a big one
